<strong>Harold Hamm</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> THANK YOU, IT IS GOOD TO BE
IN CLEVELAND.
FOUR YEARS AGO, DONALD TRUMP
ASKED ME TO TELL HIM ABOUT THE
AMERICAN ENERGY RENAISSANCE AND
HOW WE HAVE TRANSFORMED<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> THE NORTH DAKOTA INTO THE LARGEST
U.S. OIL DISCOVERY EFFORT. I TOLD HIM IT WAS MOVING AMERICA
FROM ENERGY SCARCITY TO ONE OF
ABUNDANCE. CHANGE THE WORLD FOREVER AND CAN
POWER AMERICA TO GREATNESS ONCE
AGAIN. HE WROTE THAT DOWN. DONALD TRUMP. IT. PRESIDENT TRUMP WILL BECOME THE FIRST PRESIDENT TO ACHIEVE
AMERICAN ENERGY INDEPENDENCE.
[CHEERING] PRESIDENT OBAMA CHOSE NOT TO GET IT. HE HAS TRIED TO DESTROY THIS RENAISSANCE AND ALL OF ITS
BENEFITS. INSTEAD, HE TURNED ON A RAIN
OIL, GAVE THEM THE BOMB, BILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND VILIFIED ISRAEL. WHAT WOULD YOU DO THAT -- WHY
WOULD HE DO THAT? OBAMA IMPOSED REGULATIONS TO
STOP THIS RENAISSANCE AND IN HIS ILLUSTRATIONS AND WORDS, THEY WANT TO CRUCIFY HIM WHILE -- AMERICA'S OIL AND NATURAL GAS
PRODUCER. HILLARY CLINTON PROMISES MORE OF
THE VERY SAME. AMERICA HAS TWO DISTINCT CHOICES, OUR NATION SHOULD
EMBRACE ENERGY INDEPENDENCE, NOT ELIMINATE IT. HILLARY CLINTON WOULD ELIMINATE FOSSIL FUEL DEVELOPMENT IN AMERICA.
SHE WOULD KILL JOBS, DRIVE GAS
PRICES UP AND INCREASE OIL
IMPORTS FROM OUR ENEMIES. PRESIDENT TRUMP WILL GET RID OF FOIL -- FOREIGN OIL, TRASH REGULATIONS, CREATE MILLIONS OF JOBS.
[CHEERING] THE MOST STRATEGIC GOP WEAPON,
CRUDE OIL. FOREIGN OIL HAS PLUMMETED BY
65%. AMERICA NOW HAS MORE OIL THAN SAUDI ARABIA OR RUSSIA. WE CAN DOUBLE YOU OIL PRODUCTION AGAIN AND PUT AMERICA IN A
GLOBAL LEAGUE OF ITS OWN. DONALD TRUMP WILL RESTORE
AMERICA'S RIGHTFUL PLACE AT THE
ENERGY LEADER OF THE WORLD.
[CHEERING] EVERY TIME WE CAN DRILL A WELL IN AMERICA, TERRORISM IS BEING FUNDED. ROLANDO -- ORLANDO BROUGHT THIS
HOME ONCE AGAIN. IT HAS BEEN 15 YEARS SINCE 9/11. WE CAN'T IGNORE THIS PROBLEM ANY LONGER, IT IS NOT GOING AWAY. CLIMATE CHANGE IS NOT A PROBLEM,
IT IS ISLAMIC TERRORISM.
[CHEERING] EVERY HONORS -- ONEROUS REGULARS
AND PUT THE MARKET WAS AT RISK.
DEVELOPING AMERICA'S OWN OIL
SUPPLY IS A MATTER OF NATIONAL
SECURITY. CRITICS SAY, I'M JUST A
WELL-TO-DO SUPPORTER OF DONALD
TRUMP, THEY DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT 13 CHILD, WAS INSPIRED BY A TEACHER.
I CANNOT START SCHOOL BEFORE THE FIRST SNOW OR CHRISTMAS,
WHICHEVER ONE CAME FIRST. PULLING COTTON, MY FIRST
MEMORIES ARE PICKING COTTON
BAREFOOT. I'M STANDING HERE TONIGHT
BECAUSE THE AMERICAN DREAM WAS
ALIVE AND WELL WHEN I STRUCK OUT
ON MY OWN AT 20 YEARS OLD WITH NOTHING BUT A TRUCK, AND NOTE
AND A FUN.
-- PHONE.
[CHEERING] THANK GOD WE HAVE A CLEAR CHOICE TODAY. DONALD TRUMP AND MIKE PENCE WILL
RESTORE THE AMERICAN DREAM FOR THE NEXT CHILDREN FROM SMALL-TOWN AMERICA AND THEY WILL
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN.
[CHEERING] GOD BLESS AMERICA!
