<strong>Unidentified Speaker</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> FIRST ENTRY IS THE DREAM HAS
BACKING FROM NIGHT SKIES PART IN
THE LIGHT OF A MILLION STARS ON
QUIET, CLEAR NIGHTS.
IT IGNITED THE MINDS OF PEERLESS<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> AND DETERMINED INDIVIDUALS WHO
SUMMONED THE COURAGE TO BREAK
THE RULES OF GRAVITY. 47 YEARS AGO, JULY 20, 1969, A YOUNG MAN FROM OHIO TOOK ONE GIANT LEAP FOR MANKIND.
WE CELEBRATE THE MEMORY AND SELFLESS COURAGE OF NEIL ARMSTRONG AND THE APOLLO 11
TEAM. HE WOULD REMIND US OF ALL THOSE WHO CAME BEFORE HIM TO MAKE HIS JOURNEY INTO HISTORY POSSIBLE. LIKE HIS TWO YOUNG BROTHERS FROM
JUST DOWN THE ROAD IN DAYTON, ORVILLE AND WILBUR BUILT THE
FIRST SUCCESSFUL PLAYING IN THE
BACK OF THEIR BICYCLE SHOP. BEFORE WE KNEW IT, THE RACE FOR
SPACE WAS ON.
BY 1958, THE NATION COMMITTED TO WINNING AND NASA WAS BORN. THE SKIES WERE NO LONGER THE
LIMIT. AMERICA AIMED FOR THE MOON AND THE STARS. WHILE ALL THAT WAS HAPPENING,
ANOTHER YOUNG HERO FROM CAMBRIDGE, OHIO WAS WRITING HIS OWN CHAPTER. A DECORATED FIGHTER PILOT AND COMBAT VETERAN, JOHN GLENN BECAME THE FIRST AMERICAN TO
ORBIT THE EARTH ON FEBRUARY 20,
1962. SOON, BRAVE WOMEN EMERGED BEYOND BREAKING GLASS CEILINGS, THEY
BROKE DOWN BARRIERS AND THE
EARTH ATMOSPHERE. YOU WILL MEET ONE OF THEM IN A
MOMENT.
AT THE AGE OF 23, EILEEN COLLINS
BECAME THE FIRST FEMALE FLIGHT INSTRUCTOR IN THE HISTORY OF THE
UNITED STATES AIR FORCE.
SHE BECAME THE FIRST WOMAN TO
PILOT THE SPACE SHUTTLE.
LATER SHE BECAME THE FIRST TO
COMMAND A SPECIAL MISSION.
THEN, AFTER THE NATION GROUP THE
LOSS OF SPACE SHUTTLE MONDAY, SHE FEARLESSLY LET OUR FIRST COMMISSION -- MISSION BACK INTO SPACE AND SHE BROUGHT IT BACK
SAFELY AND THE WHOLE WORLD BREATHED A SIGH OF RELIEF. AMERICA'S ASTRONAUTS, STRIVING
TO SEE THEIR COUNTRY ACHIEVED GREATNESS INSPIRED BY THE STAR SKIES ON CLEAR NIGHTS AND
ACCOMPLISH MEN'S OF THOSE
PIONEERS WHO PRECEDED THEM.
WHAT IS IT ABOUT THIS GREAT COUNTRY WHERE SO MANY HAVE
RISKED SO MUCH AND TRAVELED SO
FAR INTO THE HEAVENS? THERE ARE MANY ANSWERS IN THE
EYES OF THESE BRAVE MEN AND
WOMEN, BUT THERE IS ONE WE ALL SHARE, THEY LOVE THEIR COUNTRY
SO DEEPLY THEY WERE WILLING TO RISK THEIR LIVES TO KEEP IT STRONG AND MAKE A GREAT.
-- MAKE IT GREAT. YOU LOOK TO THE HEAVENS TONIGHT,
TAKE A MINUTE TO THANK GOD FOR
EACH AND EVERY ONE OF THEM. AND STAND NEXT TO THE U.S. WILL
SOON RECLAIM ITS RIGHT PLACE AS
THE LEADER IN SPACE EXPIRATION
-- EXPLORATION BECAUSE IT WILL SUMMON THE COURAGE AND STRENGTH TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. WHEN FUTURE ASTRONAUTS LOOK UP
TO THE NIGHT SKY, THEY ONE OTHER
COUNTRIES WE CAN FOR THEM. GREATNESS ABOUNDS AND ONCE AGAIN, THE STARS ARE THE LIMITS.
