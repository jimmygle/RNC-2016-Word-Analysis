<p class='short_transcript'> >> GOOD AFTERNOON. HOW ARE YOU DOING THIS AFTERNOON? I WANT TO WELCOME YOU TO CLEVELAND. AS WAS MENTIONED TO THE HOME OF THE NBA 2016 CHAMPIONS, THE CLEVELAND<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> CAVALIERS.
I HOPE YOU TAKE SOME TIME TO GET
TO KNOW US, BECAUSE WE ARE
REALLY HAPPY YOU ARE HERE. EVERYTHING WE HAVE DONE THAT HAS
BEEN IN CLEVELAND THAT'S BEEN SUCCESSFUL, INCLUDING THE
OPPORTUNITY TO HOST THIS CONVENTION, IS BECAUSE WE HAVE DONE IT AS A COMMUNITY. OUR INNOVATIVE REFORM PLAN WAS THE RESULT OF COLLABORATION BETWEEN REPUBLICANS, DEMOCRATS, BUSINESS, LABOR, PUBLIC SCHOOLS, CHARTER SCHOOLS, PHILANTHROPIC COMMUNITIES, AND OF COURSE THE
CITIZENS OF THE COMMUNITY'S OF CLEVELAND. OUR COOPERATIVE EFFORTS RESULTED IN A COMPREHENSIVE WITH -- COMPREHENSIVE AGREEMENT WITH POLICE AND A VISION THAT GOES
BEYOND THAT AGREEMENT TO PROVIDE OUR CITIZENS WITH WELL-EQUIPPED
AND WELL-TRAINED POLICE
DIVISIONS THAT HAS COMMUNITY POLICING AS PART OF ITS REAL POLICING FOR -- REAL POLICING REFORM. WE ARE A CITY OF GREAT ETHNIC
AND CULTURAL DIVERSITY THAT
WORKS TOGETHER TO WELCOME EVERYONE. THE REBIRTH OF CLEVELAND IS EVIDENT AS WE LOOK AT CLEVELAND
BECOMING A DESTINATION FOR BUSINESSES, A NEW RESIDENT FOR
FOOD AND ENTERTAINMENT AND
LIFESTYLE. CLEVELAND IS A CITY OF MOVIE
MAKE IN. WE PUT ON THIS YEAR'S 2016
REPUBLICAN NATIONAL CONVENTION. YOU ARE IN A CITY WITH THE MOST
ROBUST CULTURE OF ARTS BETWEEN
NEW YORK AND CHICAGO. SEE A SHOW ON ONE OF OUR STAGES,
YOU ARE IN A CITY WITH
WORLD-CLASS RESTAURANTS AND
CHEFS. ENJOY OUR DOWNTOWN HOSPITALITY,
VENTURE INTO OUR NEIGHBORHOODS
AS WELL AS OUR NEWLY RENOVATED
SQUARE. ALL THESE THINGS ARE A REFLECTION OF THE HARD-WORKING AND DIVERSE PEOPLE OF THIS CITY. AS I TRAVEL THROUGHOUT THE CITY AND I TALKED TO THE PEOPLE WILL,
I AM REMINDED THAT WE STILL HAVE A WAYS TO GO TO BECOME A GREAT CITY. A TRULY GREAT CITY WILL BE MEASURED BY THE WELL-BEING OF ITS PEOPLE. I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT WELFARE AND CHARITY. I'M TALKING ABOUT HOW DO WE HAVE EVERYONE PARTICIPATE IN THAT QUALITY OF LIFE?
. IT IS STRIVING FOR GREATNESS. THIS IS THE CHALLENGE WE EMBRACE
AND THE STRUGGLE AND THE FIGHT
WE TAKE ON. HE WILL BE SUCCESSFUL BECAUSE WE WILL DO IT AS ONE COMMUNITY. SOME OF YOU MAY HAVE HEARD ABOUT LAST MONTH'S NBA GAMES WHEN THE
CAVALIERS DID NOT INVITE A
NATIONALLY KNOWN RECORDING ARTIST TO SING THE NATIONAL
ANTHEM. IN THIS BUILDING WE ALL SING IT
TOGETHER. IT'S IN THAT SPIRIT WE GREET YOU
TO CLEVELAND AND WELCOME YOU TO
CLEVELAND. ENJOY YOUR TIME HERE, GET TO
KNOW US, AND WE HOPE YOU WILL
GET THE AXIOM.
-- HE WILL COME BACK SOON.
-- WE HOPE YOU WILL COME BACK
SOON. IT IS MY HONOR TO WELCOME MR. --</span><span class='hidden-full-transcript-ellipses'>...</span></p><a href='#' class='hidden-full-transcript-link'><i class='icon-chevron-down'></i> <span class='link-show-full-text'>Show Full Text</span><i class='icon-chevron-up'></i> <span class='link-show-less-text'>Show Less Text</span></a>
