<strong>Kimberly Yee</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> PLEASE WELCOME ARIZONA STATE SENATOR, KIMBERLY YEE. GOOD AFTERNOON. MY NAME IS KIMBERLY YEE AND I REPRESENT THE GREAT STATE OF
ARIZONA. I'M THE DAUGHTER<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> OF A PUBLIC SCHOOL TEACHER AND SMALL
BUSINESS OWNER. MY DAUGHTER WHO PROUDLY SERVED
IN THE U.S. ARMY IS HERE WITH ME
TODAY FOR -- WITH ME TODAY.
[APPLAUSE] LIKE MANY CHINESE-AMERICANS, MY
STORY STARTS WITH MY GREAT GREAT GRANDFATHER WHO CAME TO THE
UNITED STATES AT THE TURN OF THE
20TH CENTURY. FOR ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY. HE OPENED A HAND LAUNDRY
BUSINESS.
HIS SON AND TWO GENERATIONS LATER, HIS GRANDSON WOULD RUN
THEIR OWN FAMILY BUSINESS. MY PARENTS TAUGHT ME THAT I
COULD ACHIEVE ANYTHING I WANTED
IN THIS GREAT COUNTRY. THOUGH THEY WOULD NEVER HAVE
IMAGINED I WOULD BECOME THE
FIRST ASIAN-AMERICAN WOMAN TO BE
ELECTED TO THE STATE LEGISLATURE
IN ARIZONA'S HISTORY. THANK YOU. IT'S BECAUSE OF THE UNLIMITED
OPPORTUNITIES THAT ONLY AMERICA
AFFORDS THAT I HUMBLY STAND
BEFORE YOU TODAY. I REPRESENT THE VALUES OF EVERY DAY, HARD-WORKING AMERICANS WHO
ASPIRE TO ACHIEVE IN ORDER TO -- ASPIRE TO SUCCEED IN ORDER TO
ACHIEVE THE AMERICAN DREAM.
, DAUGHTER, MOTHER, AND SMALL
BUSINESS OWNER. I BRING TO THESE ROLES BY JOB AS
A CITIZEN LEGISLATOR
REPRESENTING MY CONSTITUENT, FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS. WE CANNOT SPEND MORE THAN WE
MAKE. WE MUST DEFEND OUR FREEDOMS AT
HOME AND ABROAD. WE SHOULD VALUE AND PROTECT
LIFE. OUR BUSINESSES RUN BEST WHEN GOVERNMENT INTERVENES THE LEAST. THESE ARE THE PRINCIPLES I HOLD
DEAR AND I WILL TEACH MY
CHILDREN. IT IS TIME FOR US TO GET BACK TO OUR CONSERVATIVE, REPUBLICAN VALUES THAT HAVE MADE OUR NATION
GREAT. WE CANNOT ENDURE THE NEXT FOUR YEARS LIKE WE HAVE THE PAST EIGHT. IT IS BECAUSE OF THESE PRINCIPLES THAT I SUPPORT DONALD
J TRUMP FOR PRESIDENT. THANK YOU AND MAY GOD BLESS
AMERICA.
