<strong>Unidentified Speaker</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> TODAY I WAS COMPELLED TO SIT DOWN AND WRITE THIS LETTER. NOT TO ANYONE IN PARTICULAR,
MAYBE EVEN JUST FOR MYSELF. THAT COME FAMILY THAT I KNOW IS
WITHOUT<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> QUESTION ONE OF THE MOST
GENEROUS AND COMPASSIONATE AND PHILANTHROPIC FAMILIES I'VE EVER
HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF KNOWING AND
BEYOND TO CALL FRIENDS. THEY HAVE BEEN INCREDIBLE LOYAL TO ME AND TO THE COUNTLESS
DEDICATED TO THE BAND PLAY
AROUND WITH. HIRING MORE MINORITIES IN CHEMO EXECUTIVES AND ANY OTHER
COMPANY. REST ASSURED, I'M A HIGHLY INTELLIGENT FREETHINKING AND
INDEPENDENT WOMAN. MY OPINIONS AND DECISIONS ARE
BASED SOLELY ON FACTS. NONFICTION, SPECULATION, ASSUMPTION OR HEARSAY. I DO NOT VOTE BASED UPON THE
COLOR OF MY SKIN NOR THE
SIGNATURE ON THE PAYCHECK. I JUDGE MY FRIENDS AND FORGE MY ALLEGIANCES THROUGH INTERACTIONS. THAT SAID, THERE IS NO HIGHER BROADER BY WHICH TO MEASURE ONESELF THAN THE ONE CONTINUALLY SET BY THE TRUMP FAMILY. THE TRUMP FAMILY HAS TO BUY ME
THROUGH MANY DIFFICULT TIMES
WITHOUT HESITATION OR CONCERN
FOR THEIR OWN REPUTATION BY
ASSOCIATION. THEY CONTINUE TO TRUST ME WITH
EVERY ASPECT OF THEIR LIVES AND THE LIVES OF THEIR FAMILIES. THEY INVITE ME TO THE HOME AND WELCOMING AT THE FAMILY
GATHERING. THE PAST SIX YEARS I FELT AN EXECUTIVE POSITION AS A PERTAINS
TO THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE
INTERNAL FUNDS AND HAVE CHARGED
ME TO IDENTIFY WORTHY AN ULTRA
STICK MISSIONS.
I CANNOT BE MORE HUMBLED. THIS IS THE TRUMP FAMILY THAT I
KNOW. THERE IS A MOVEMENT SWEEPING
THIS BRAVE NATION AND I'M
HONORED TO HAVE A FRONT ROW
SEAT. THIS COUNTRY HAS SPOKEN. MY BOSS HAS SPURNED THE
REPUBLICAN NOMINATION AND THE VOTER REGISTRATION RECORD IN
COUNTLESS STATES ACROSS AMERICA.
THIS CANNOT BE DENIED. HE HAS OPTED -- BROUGHT THE PARTY TOGETHER. HE HAS EARNED MORE REPUBLICAN VOTES THAN ANY OTHER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE IN MODERN HISTORY. THAT MUST BE RESPECTED. TO THE SKEPTICS WHO WILL
UNDOUBTEDLY CLAIM I'M DOING THIS
AT THE BEHEST OF THE TRUMP
FAMILY COME WITH THE PROMISE OF REWARD, I GLIBLY CHOSE -- ACETATE CANCELED. AND THE POTENTIAL BUYER RAMIFICATION. AND THERE WOULD BE FOR
THEMSELVES IN THE FACT THAT THIS
IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO. FOR ME, IT WAS NOT A TOUGH
DECISION. JUST LIKE VOTING FOR MY BOSS
SHOULD BE AN EASY DECISION FOR
YOU.
GOD BLESS THE FAMILY AND GOD
BLESS THE VOTERS AND GOT BUT THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.
