[CHEERING] THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
[CHEERING] YOU HAVE ALL BEEN VERY KIND TO DONALD AND ME, TO OUR YOUNG SON AND OUR WHOLE FAMILY.
IT IS A<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> VERY NICE WELCOME AND WE
ARE EXCITED TO BE WITH YOU AT THIS HISTORIC CONVENTION.
>> WE LOVE YOU!
[CHEERING]
>>>> I'M SO PROUD FOR YOUR CHOICE
OF PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED
STATES, MY HUSBAND, DONALD J TRUMP.
[CHEERING] AND I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT HE IS MOVED WHY THIS GREAT HONOR. THE 2016 REPUBLICAN PRIMARY WERE FIERCE AND STARTED WITH MANY CANDIDATES, 17 TO BE EXACT. AND I KNOW THAT DONALD AGREES
WITH ME AND I MENTIONED HOW TALENTED ALL OF THEM ARE. THEY DESERVE THE SUCCESS AND
GRATITUDE FOR ALL OF US.
[CHEERING] HOWEVER, WHEN IT COMES TO MY
HUSBAND, I WOULD SAY THAT HE IS
FOR GOOD REASON, I'VE SEEN THE DONALD FOR 18 YEARS AND I'VE
BEEN AWARE OF HIS LOVE FOR THIS COUNTRY SINCE WE FIRST MET. HE NEVER HAD  [INDISCERNIBLE] PATRIOTISM. LIKE ME, HE LOVES THIS COUNTRY VERY MUCH.
[CHEERING] I WAS BORN IN SLOVENIA A SMALL, PITIFUL COUNTRY AND THAT FOR
YOUR. MY HARD-WORKING MOTHER TRADUCED
ME TO FASHION AND BEAUTY. MY FATHER INSTILLED IN ME A PASSION FOR BUSINESS AND TRAVEL. THEIR INTEGRITY, COMPASSION AND INTELLIGENCE TO THIS DAY ON ME,
MY LOVE FOR FAMILY AND AMERICA.
[CHEERING] MY PARENTS IMPRESSED ON ME THE VALUE OF THAT YOU WORK HARD FOR
WHAT YOU WANT IN LIFE. THAT YOUR WORK IS YOUR BOND AND
YOU DO WHAT YOU SAY AND KEEP
YOUR PROMISE. THAT YOU TREAT PEOPLE WITH RESPECT. SHOW THE VALUES AND MORALS IN
THE DAILY LIFE. THAT IS THE LESSON THAT WE
CONTINUE TO PASS ON TO OUR SON. WE NEED TO PASS THOSE LESSONS ON
TO THE MANY GENERATIONS TO FOLLOW.
[CHEERING] BECAUSE WE WANT OUR CHILDREN IN
THESE NATIONS TO KNOW THAT THE ONLY LIMIT TO YOUR ACHIEVEMENT
IS THE STRENGTH OF YOUR DREAMS
AND YOUR WILLINGNESS TO WORK FOR
THEM.
[CHEERING] I'M FORTUNATE FOR MY HERITAGE
AND WHERE IT HAS BROUGHT ME
TODAY.
I TRAVELED THE WORLD BY WORKING HARD IN THE INCREDIBLE ARENA FASHION. AFTER LIVING AND WORKING IN
MILAN AND PARIS, I ARRIVED IN
NEW YORK CITY 20 YEARS AGO. I SAW THE JOY AND HARDSHIPS OF
DAILY LIFE. ON JULY 20 8, 2006, I WAS VERY PROUD TO BECOME A CITIZEN OF THE
UNITED STATES.
[CHEERING] THE GREATEST PRIVILEGE ON PLANET
EARTH.
[CHEERING] I WILL NOT TAKE THE FREEDOM THIS
COUNTRY OFFERS FOR GRANTED. BUT THESE FREEDOMS HAVE -- THE SACRIFICES MADE BY OUR VETERANS,
A REMINDER TO US OF THIS. I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE A MOMENT TO RECOGNIZED SOME AMAZING VETERANS. A GREAT SENATOR BOB DOLE.
[CHEERING] LET US ALL THINK I VETERANS IN
THE ARENA TODAY IT DOES ACROSS
OUR GREAT COUNTRY.
-- THOSE ACROSS OUR GREAT
COUNTRY.
[CHEERING] WE ARE ALL TRULY BLESSED TO BE HERE. THAT WILL NEVER CHANGE. I CAN TYPE WITH CERTAINTY THAT MY HUSBAND HAS BEEN CONCERNED ABOUT OUR COUNTRY FOR AS LONG AS
I HAVE KNOWN HIM. WITH ALL OF MY HEART, I KNOW
THAT HE WILL MAKE A GREAT AND LASTING DIFFERENCE. DONALD HAS A GREAT DEVOTION TO THE NATION AND NEVER GIVE UP
ATTITUDE. I HAVE SEEN HIM -- HE DOES NOT
GIVE UP.
[CHEERING] IF YOU WANT SOMEONE TO FIGHT FOR
YOU AND YOUR COUNTRY, I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT HE IS THE GUY.
[CHEERING] HE WILL NEVER EVER GIVE UP AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, HE WILL NEVER
EVER LET YOU DOWN.
[CHEERING] DONALD IS AND ALWAYS HAS BEEN AN AMAZING LEADER. NOW, HE WILL GO TO WORK FOR YOU.
[CHEERING] HIS ACHIEVEMENTS SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES AND HIS PERFORMANCE WITHOUT THE PRIMARY CAMPAIGN, PROVED THAT HE KNOWS HOW TO WIN. HE ALSO KNOWS HOW TO REMIND -- REMAIN FOCUSED ON IMPROVING OUR COUNTRY ON KEEPING IT SAFE, I'M
KEEPING IT SECURE.
[CHEERING] HE IS TOUGH WHEN HE HAS TO BE,
THAT HE IS ALSO KIND AND FAIR
AND CARING. THIS KIND IS IS NOT ALWAYS NOTED
, BUT IT IS THERE FOR ALL TO
SEE. THAT IS ONE REASON I FELL IN LOVE WITH HIM TO BEGIN WITH.
[CHEERING] DONALD IS INTENSELY LOYAL TO FAMILY, FRIENDS, EMPLOYEES, COUNTRY.
HE HAS THE UTMOST RESPECT FOR HIS PARENTS, TO HIS SISTER AND HIS BROTHER INTO THE MEMORY.
HIS CHILDREN HAVE BEEN CARED FOR
AND MENTORED TO THE EXTENT THAT EVEN HIS ADVISERS ADMIT THAT
THEY ARE AMAZING TESTAMENT TO
WHO HE IS AS A MAN AND A FATHER.
[CHEERING] A GREAT DEAL OF LOVE AND THE
TRUMP FAMILY.
THAT IS OUR BOND AND THAT IS OUR
STRENGTH. YES, DONALD, WHEN CONSIDERING THE PRESIDENCY OF THE UNITED STATES, NOT FOR SMALL THINKING,
NOT FOR SMALL RESULTS. DONALD GETS THINGS DONE.
[CHEERING] OUR COUNTRY IS UNDERPERFORMING
AND NEEDS NEW LEADERSHIP. LEADERSHIP IS ALSO WHAT THE
WORLD NEEDS. DONALD WANT OUR COUNTRY TO MOVE FORWARD IN THE MOST POSITIVE OF
WAYS. EVERYONE WANTS CHANGE. DONALD IS THE ONLY ONE THAT CAN
DELIVER IT. WE SHOULD NOT BE SATISFIED WITH STAGNATION. DONALD ONCE PROSPERITY FOR ALL AMERICANS.
[CHEERING] WE NEED NEW PROGRAMS TO HOUSE THE POOR AND OPPORTUNITIES TO
CHALLENGE THE YOUNG.
THERE HAS TO BE A PLAN FOR GROWTH AND ONLY THEN WILL WE SEE
FOR RESULTS. MY HUSBAND'S EXPERIENCE THAT APPLIES GROWTH AND OPPORTUNITY
TO THE NEXT GENERATION. HIS SUCCESS INDICATES INCLUSION
RATHER THAN THE MISSION. MY HUSBAND OFFERS A NEW DIRECTION, WELCOMING CHANGE AND POSTERITY AND GREATER COOPERATION AMONG PEOPLE AND
NATIONS. DONALD INTENT TO PREVENT ALL THE PEOPLE -- DEFEND ALL THE PEOPLE, NOT JUST SOME OF THE PEOPLE.
[CHEERING] THAT INCLUDES CHRISTIANS, JEWS, MUSLIMS, INCLUDES HISPANICS AND AFRICAN-AMERICANS AND ASIANS AND THE POOR AND MIDDLE CLASS.
[CHEERING] THROUGHOUT HIS CAREER, DONALD
HAS SUCCESSFULLY WORKED WITH PEOPLE OF MANY FAITHS AND MANY
NATIONS. LIKE NO ONE ELSE, I HAVE SEEN
THE TALENT, THE ENERGY, THE
TENNESSEE THAT A SOULFUL MIND AND THE SIMPLE GOODNESS OF THE HEART THAT GOD GAVE TO DONALD TRUMP. NOW IS THE TIME TO USE THOSE GIFTS AS NEVER BEFORE FOR
PURPOSES FAR GREATER THAN EVER. AND HE WILL DO THIS BETTER THAN
EVERYONE ELSE CAN.
AND IT WON'T EVEN BE CLOSE.
[CHEERING] EVERYONE DEPENDS ON THE CAUSING COUNTRY. ALL THE MILLIONS OF YOU TO HAVE
TAUGHT US SO MUCH WITH YOUR
KINDNESS AND CONFIDENCE, YOU HAVE TURNED THIS UNLIKELY CAMPAIGN INTO A MOVEMENT THAT IS STILL GAINING IN STRENGTH AND
NUMBERS.
[CHEERING] THE PRIMARY SEASON IN THE
DARKNESS IS BEHIND US. LET'S ALL COME TOGETHER IN A NATIONAL CAMPAIGN LIKE NO OTHER.
[CHEERING] THE RACE WILL BE HARD-FOUGHT ALL
THE WAY TO NOVEMBER. THERE BE GOOD TIMES AND HARD
TIMES.
AN EXPERT TUTORS. IT WOULD NOT BE A TRUMP CONTEST WITHOUT EXCITEMENT AND DRAMA. WITHOUT THE DOLL, -- THROUGHOUT IT ALL, MY HUSBAND WILL BE
FOCUSED ON ONE THING, THIS BEAUTIFUL COUNTRY THAT HE LOVES SO MUCH.
[CHEERING] I'M HONORED TO SERVE AS FIRST LADY, I WILL USE THE PRIVILEGE
TO TRY TO HELP PEOPLE IN OUR COUNTRY WHO NEED IT THE MOST. ONE OF THE MANY CAUSES DEAR TO MY HEART IS HELPING CHILDREN AND
WOMEN. THE JUDGE SOCIETY BY HOW IT
TREATS ITS CITIZENS.
WE MUST DO OUR BEST TO ENSURE
THAT EVERY CHILD CAN LIVE IN COMFORT AND SECURITY WITH THE BEST POSSIBLE EDUCATION.
[CHEERING] CITIZENS OF THIS GREAT NATION,
IT IS KINDNESS, LOVE, AND COMPASSION FOR EACH OTHER THAT
WILL BRING US TOGETHER AND KEEP
US TOGETHER.
[CHEERING] THESE ARE THE VALUES DONALD
AND I WOULD BRING TO THE WHITE
HOUSE.
[CHEERING] MY HUSBAND IS READY TO LEAD THIS
NATION. HE IS READY TO FIGHT EVERY DAY
TO GIVE OUR CHILDREN A BETTER FUTURE, THE BETTER FUTURE THEY DESERVE. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN DONALD J TRUMP IS READY TO SERVE AND LEAD THIS COUNTRY AS THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.
[CHEERING] THANK YOU. GOD BLESS YOU.
AND GOD BLESS AMERICA!
