<strong>Laura Ingraham</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> HELLO, EVERYBODY.
>> WE LOVE YOU, LAURA!
>> I LOVE YOU BACK.
[CHEERING]
>> LAURA, LAURA, LAURA!
>> THANK YOU. SIT DOWN. YOU ALL KNOW ME FROM TV AND<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> RADIO. BUT, I KIDS KNOW ME BY MY WAS
IMPORTANT NAME, MOM.
[CHEERING] I'M A SINGLE MOTHER OF THREE
ADOPTED CHILDREN AND THEY ARE
WATCHING IN MINNESOTA RIGHT NOW.
[CHEERING] AND I'M HERE TONIGHT SUPPORTING DONALD TRUMP.
[CHEERING] BECAUSE LIKE MOST AMERICANS, I
REFUSE TO LEAVE MY KIDS A COUNTRY THAT IS WORSE OFF THAN THE ONE MY PARENTS LEFT ME.
[CHEERING] NOW, MY GRANDPARENTS WERE POLISH
IMMIGRANTS. MY PARENTS, THEY GREW UP AND
DEPRESSION ERA NEW ENGLAND. MY DAD, HE LISTED IN THE NAVY IN
WORLD WAR II.
[CHEERING] MY MOM, SHE WAITED TABLES UNTIL
SHE WAS 73 YEARS OLD. MY DAD, HE WORKED AT A CAR WASH. MY PARENTS FLEW THE FLAG AT OUR HOUSE AND NOT JUST ON THE FOURTH
OF JULY.
[CHEERING] AND THEY SAVED, MY MOTHER MADE MY CLOSE, -- CLOTHES, SHE WORE
THE SAME WITH HER COAT FOR 20
YEARS -- 40 YEARS.
ANY EXTRA MONEY WENT INTO THE
BANK FOR OUR EDUCATION. AND WE LEARNED THAT THERE IS DIGNITY IN EVERY JOB.
[CHEERING] EVERY JOB. NO MATTER WHAT YOU DO. MY BROTHERS, THEY TAKE TOBACCO AND DELIVER NEWSPAPERS. I PICKED BLUEBERRIES AND GREAT
-- RAKED LAWNS.
MY PARENTS DID NOT BELIEVE THERE
WERE JOBS THAT AMERICANS WOULD
NOT DO.
[CHEERING] IN THE EARLY 70'S, I WAS A
LITTLE KID AND I REMEMBER
WATCHING THE NEWS WITH MY MOM THAT NIGHT AND ONE NIGHT COME AFTER, MOM, WHY ARE PEOPLE
BURNING THE AMERICAN FLAG? AND SHE LOOKED AT ME AND SHE ANSWERED, HONEY, BECAUSE THEIR PARENTS DID NOT TEACH THEM ABOUT RESPECT.
[CHEERING] YOU WOULD HAVE LOVED MY MOTHER.
[CHEERING] RESPECT. RESPECT. RECEIPT AND DECLINE IN AMERICA ONCE AGAIN.
-- WE SEE IT IN DECLINE ONCE AGAIN IN AMERICA.
PEOPLE DON'T RESPECT THE
GOVERNMENT. GOVERNMENT DOES NOT RESPECT THE
PEOPLE.
NOT EVEN OUR VETERANS.
>> BOO!
>> POLITICIANS DON'T RESPECT THE
CONSTITUTION. MANY DO NOT RESPECT THE LIFE OF THE INFANT IN THE WOMB OR THAT
ELDERLY WHO LANGUISH -- THE ELDERLY WHO LANGUISH ALONE.
[CHEERING] OTHERS, YOU DON'T RESPECT THE POLICE.
-- THEY DON'T RESPECT THE
POLICE. THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO RISK THEIR
LIVES EVERY DAY FOR EVERY ONE OF
US.
[CHEERING] MANY IN PUBLIC OFFICE, WE KNOW
THIS ALL TOO WELL, MANY IN PUBLIC OFFICE DON'T ENFORCE OR RESPECT THE RULE OF LAW, ISN'T THAT RIGHT, MRS. CLINTON?
[CHEERING] THAT'S RIGHT THERE I.
[CHEERING] TOO MANY CITIZENS DON'T RESPECT
OUR LAWS EITHER.
MANY OF OUR ALLIES, THEY DON'T RESPECT US ANYMORE. MY FRIENDS, IT IS REALLY SAD AND HEARTBREAKING, TO SEE THIS
HAPPEN TO THE COUNTRY THAT WE LOVE.
THIS IS OUR HOME. IT BELONGS TO US.
TO OUR CHILDREN, TO OUR
GRANDCHILDREN. IT IS WHERE OUR DEAD ARE BURIED. AND WE DESERVE BETTER AND WE CAN
DO BETTER.
[CHEERING] LIKE US, DONALD TRUMP UNDERSTANDS THAT WE HAVE TO TURN THIS AROUND.
WE HAVE TO RESTORE RESPECT ACROSS ALL LEVELS OF SOCIETY. UNLIKE US, HILLARY CLINTON BELIEVES THE STATUS QUO IS JUST FINE BECAUSE SHE HELPED CREATE IT. DONALD TRUMP KNOWS THAT A NATION WITHOUT BORDERS ISN'T A NATION AT ALL. HILLARY CLINTON, SHE DOES NOT BELIEVE IN BORDERS. DONALD TRUMP KNOWS THAT A
COUNTRY MUST PUT IT CITIZENS
FIRST. AND WHAT ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON? SHE THINKS AMERICA'S JUST ANOTHER NATION AND A GLOBAL ORDER -- IN A GLOBAL ORDER. DONALD TRUMP, HE UNDERSTANDS THAT AMERICA'S GREATNESS COMES FROM HER PEOPLE, FROM HER
FREEDOM.
[CHEERING] HILLARY CLINTON, SHE BELIEVES
OUR GREATNESS CAN ONLY BE FOUND
IN THE EVER-GROWING, BLOATED
GOVERNMENT BUREAUCRACY THAT ONLY
SHE, HER MAJESTY, CAN ROLLOVER. SHE BELIEVES THAT THERE IS A GOVERNMENT SOLUTION FOR EVERY
COLUMN. NO HILLARY, YOU ARE THE PROBLEM.
[CHEERING] I WAS THINKING ABOUT BACK WHEN I
WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL, 1979, WE
WERE IN A MESS BACK THEN.
WE WAITED IN LINE FOR GAS, WE'D WAITED -- WE WAITED FOR HOSTAGES
TO COME HOME.
WE WAITED FOR SOMEONE TO
CONVINCE US THAT THE LONG NATIONAL NIGHTMARE WOULD SOON BE
OVER. AND THEN, RONALD REAGAN RODE IN JUST-IN-TIME TO RESTORE OUR NATIONAL CONFIDENCE --
[CHEERING] HE IS WATCHING US TODAY.
[CHEERING] HE IS WATCHING. HE RODE IN TO RESTORE OUR
NATIONAL CONFIDENCE, RESTORE OUR
ECONOMY AND OUR MILITARY. TODAY, MANY OF OUR PEOPLE WAIT FOR JOBS, WE WAIT FOR A
STRATEGY, ANY STRATEGY TO KEEP US SAFE, AND OUR VETERANS, THEY DIE WAITING FOR DECENT CARE.
>> BOO!
>> EVERYBODY, WITH DONALD J TRUMP, THANK GOD THAT WAIT IS OVER.
[CHEERING] IT IS DONE.
[CHEERING] AND DONALD TRUMP HAS PLEDGED TO WORK TIRELESSLY TO GET OUR
COUNTRY BACK ON TRACK. I WANT TO SAY THIS VERY PLAINLY, WE SHOULD ALL, EVEN ALL YOU BOYS WITH WOUNDED FEELINGS AND BRUISED EGOS, WE LOVE YOU, BUT
YOU MUST HONOR YOUR PLEDGE TO SUPPORT DONALD TRUMP NOW! TONIGHT.
[CHEERING] TONIGHT.
[CHEERING] I HOPE THEY ARE LISTENING TO
YOU. I HOPE THEY ARE LISTENING. MY FRIENDS, THIS IS THE MOST ELECTION -- MOST IMPORTANT
ELECTION SINCE 1980. I WORKED FOR RONALD REAGAN AND I REMEMBER, BEFORE HE CAME ALONG WE HAD, YOU KNOW, THINGS WERE
BAD. TODAY, WE HAVE STAGNATING WAGES,
SKYROCKETING HEALTH CARE COSTS,
DOUBLING OF THE DEBT, THREAT OF
ISIS AND THE RISE OF CHINA, AND
THE DEMOCRATS ANSWER TO ALL THAT
IS TO NOMINATE THE WOMAN WHO HELPED ORCHESTRATE AMERICA'S DECLINE.
>> BOO!
>> THINK ABOUT IT. THAT HAS TO BE SOME CRUEL JOKE. LIKE SKINNY JEANS ON MEN OR MAN BUNS
. A BAD JOKE. I DON'T WANT TO SIT AROUND AND
TELL MY KIDS STORIES SOMEDAY ABOUT HOW GREAT AMERICA USED TO BE. DO YOU?
>> NO!
>> WE NEVER GIVE UP. WE RISE TO EVERY CHALLENGE, WE FIGHT AND WE WENT.
-- WIN. WE ARE AMERICANS!
[CHEERING] AND WE NEED, AMERICA, WE NEED A
PRESIDENT WHO BELIEVES IN THE CONSTITUTION AND WHO WILL FIGHT FOR US, NOT AGAINST US, TREAT US
LIKE AN ALLY, NOT AN ENEMY,
FIGHT ALONGSIDE WITH US.
[CHEERING] WE ARE NOT THE ENEMY, WE ARE THE PEOPLE!
[CHEERING] WE ARE NOT YOUR SERVANTS! YOU ARE HOURS -- OURS.
[CHEERING] TO ALL MY FRIENDS UP THERE IN THE PRESS, I FEEL, HELLO --
>> BOO!
>> TWO ALL MY FRIENDS UP THERE
IN THE PRESS, YOU ALL KNOW IN YOUR HEART DONALD TRUMP WON THE REPUBLICAN NOMINATION. YOU KNOW IT. YOU KNOW WHY HE WON IT? BECAUSE HE DARED TO CALL OUT THE
PHONIES, THE FRAUDS AND THE CORRUPTION THAT HAS GONE ON
UNEXPOSED AND UNCOVERED FOR TOO LONG.
[CHEERING] TOO LONG! DO YOUR JOB.
[CHEERING] DOING YOUR JOB IS A NOVEL
CONCEPT.
[CHEERING] PEOPLE ON ANOTHER TABLE NETWORK
WAS TALKING ABOUT HOW THERE WAS
NO ENERGY IN THE ROOM LAST NIGHT, WHAT ARE YOU SEEING HERE
WITH THE PEOPLE? AMERICA IS ON TO YOU. DONALD TRUMP RESPECTS US ENOUGH
TO TELL US THE HARD TRUTHS ABOUT WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO OUR
COUNTRY. ON ISSUES LIKE IMMIGRATION, TRADE, OUR DIMINISHED STATUS
AROUND THE WORLD, EVEN IN THE FACE OF UNFAIR CRITICISM AND SHEER HATRED, THEY HAD THEIR CHANCE.
NOW IT IS OUR CHANCE.
[CHEERING] AMERICA, LET US TONIGHT GO FORTH
AND REJECT THE POLITICS OF DIVISION. LET'S DEFEAT THE CLINTON
MACHINE.
[CHEERING] LET'S SEND THE CONSULTANT, THE POLLSTER, THE LOBBYIST PACKING!
[CHEERING] LET'S GIVE THE POWER BACK TO THE PEOPLE.
[CHEERING] AND LET'S ELECT DONALD TRUMP
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES!
[CHEERING] GOD BLESS YOU AND GOD BLESS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA!
