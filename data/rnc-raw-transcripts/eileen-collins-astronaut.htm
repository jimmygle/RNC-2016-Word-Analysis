<strong>Eileen Collins</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> IT IS GREAT TO BE WITH YOU
HERE TONIGHT.
THANK YOU. FROM THE MOMENT THE FIRST PILGRIMS ARRIVED AT OUR SHORES, AMERICANS HAVE BEEN ASKING, WHAT IS NEXT?<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> WE ARE A NATION BUILT BY THE PASSION OF PEOPLE WHO WERE NOT
AFRAID TO DO SOMETHING FIRST.
TO STEP INTO THE UNKNOWN INTO PAID OUR OWN WAY FORWARD. WE ARE A NATION OF EXPLORERS. IN 1961, PRESIDENT KENNEDY
ISSUED A CHALLENGE TO AMERICA TO
LAND A MAN ON THE MOON AND RETURN HIM SAFELY TO EARTH. IN 47 YEARS AGO, ON THIS VERY DAY, STRONG AND BUZZ ALDRIN ANSWERED THAT CALL AND THEY WALKED ON THE
MOON.
[CHEERING] AND THEY TOOK WITH THEM AN
AMERICAN FLAG AND A PLAQUE. THE INSCRIPTION, HERE MEN FROM PLANET EARTH FIRST SET FOOT UPON THE MEN -- MOON. WE CAME IN PEACE FOR ALL
MANKIND.
[CHEERING] WE LANDED ON THE MOON TO FULFILL A LEADERSHIP CHALLENGE AND TO
EXPLORE. WE KNOW THAT EXPLORATION LEADS
TO INVENTIONS, INNOVATION AND DISCOVERY. FOR EXAMPLE, OUR SUCCESSFUL ROBOTIC MISSIONS TO MARS,
JUPITER AND PLUTO HAVE PROVIDED
VITAL INFORMATION ABOUT OUR OWN PLANET. WHAT, IN 2011, THE SPACE SHUTTLE
PROGRAM ENDED. THE LAST TIME THE UNITED STATES
LAUNCHED OUR OWN ASTRONAUT FROM
OUR OWN SOIL WAS OVER FIVE YEARS AGO. WE MUST DO BETTER THAN THAT.
[CHEERING] COUNTRIES THAT ARE STRONG OUR COUNTRIES THAT DISCOVER. REMAIN RESILIENT. I'M HONORED TO HAVE PLAYED A ROLE IN THE NATION AS A HERITAGE
EXPLORE.
FIRST WOMAN TO COMMAND A SPATIAL
MISSION.
JOINING THE RANKS OF THOSE WHO
HAVE FOUGHT TO LEAD THE WAY. WE ARE ALL SO PROUD OF THE APOLLO PROGRAM TO SUPPORT OUR HAVE TO NOT ON THE MAIN FIRST ON PEACE WITH ALL MANKIND. NATIONS THAT LEAD ON THE FRONTIER LEAD IN THE WORLD.
[CHEERING] WE NEED THAT VISIONARY
LEADERSHIP AGAIN. LEADERSHIP THAT WILL INSPIRE THE NEXT GENERATION OF EXPLORERS TO HAVE THAT SAME PASSION.
WE NEED LEADERSHIP THAT WILL ASK AMERICANS, ASK AGAIN WHAT IS
NEXT. WE NEED LEADERSHIP THAT WILL MAKE AMERICANS SPACE PROGRAM
FIRST AGAIN.
[CHEERING] AND WE NEED LEADERSHIP THAT WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN.
[CHEERING] I WANT TO THANK ALL OF YOU.
THANK YOU FOR WHAT YOU ARE
DOING.
GOD BLESS AMERICA.
