<strong>Dennis Cook</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> GOOD AFTERNOON. THIS ELECTION, YOUNG PEOPLE FACE A HISTORIC CHOICE WITH CONSEQUENCES NOT JUST FOR US, BUT FOR THE GENERATION OF FUTURE AMERICANS. FOR<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> POLICIES THAT IN TIES YOUNG
VOTERS BELIEVE THEM IN PAIN FOR A LONG RUN, DEMOCRATS LOST THEIR
MONOPOLY ON USE SUPPORT IN
AMERICA. THEY PROMISE FREE COLLEGE TUITION BUT DON'T TELL YOU IT
WILL LOWER THE QUALITY OF EDUCATION AND COST HALF $1
TRILLION.
THEY PROMISE MINIMUM WAGE OF $15 BUT THEY DON'T TELL YOU IT WILL MEAN FEWER DOLLARS WHEN
COMPANIES HAVE LESS MONEY TO PAY EMPLOYEES. AND WHY WOULD THEY CONSIDER THE
CONSEQUENCES? THEIR NOMINEE FOR PRESIDENT HAS
MADE A CAREER OF SHOWING TERRIBLE JUDGMENT AND WATCHING
OTHERS PAY FOR IT. REPUBLICAN FACE AN UPHILL WITH YOUNG AMERICANS. IN CONTRAST, THE PARTY OF UNICORNS AND FAIRYTALES, WE ARE
THE PARTY OF REALITY. WE KNOW FREE MARKETS ARE BETTER THAN FREE STUFF. WE KNOW BIG GOVERNMENT SOLUTIONS RARELY DELIVER BIG SUCCESS. THERE'S NO BETTER ILLUSTRATION OF THE AMERICAN DREAM WE ARE
FIGHTING FOR THAN DONALD TRUMP
AND GOVERNOR MIKE PENCE. THEY HAVE MADE CAREERS OUT OF
PROVING FREE MARKETS AND FREE SOCIETY ARE THE GREATEST KEY TO BOTH SUCCESS, BUSINESS, AND FOR THE GREAT STATE OF INDIANA. THIS NOVEMBER, I ASKED MY FELLOW
YOUNG AMERICANS ACROSS THE
COUNTRY TO STAND WITH US, VISIT US ONLINE. WE WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT
AGAIN. THANK YOU AND GOD LESS UNITED
STATES OF AMERICA.
-- GOD BLESS THESE UNITED STATES
OF AMERICA.</span><span class='hidden-full-transcript-ellipses'>...</span></p><a href='#' class='hidden-full-transcript-link'><i class='icon-chevron-down'></i> <span class='link-show-full-text'>Show Full Text</span><i class='icon-chevron-up'></i> <span class='link-show-less-text'>Show Less Text</span></a>
