<strong>Scott Baio</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> THANK YOU FOR THE WARM
WELCOME. TONIGHT'S THEME IS MAKING
AMERICA SAFE.
I WOULD DO THINK ALL OF THE
BRAVE MEN AND WOMEN WHO
SERVE OUR COUNTRY, INCLUDING<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> RETIRED LIEUTENANT COLONEL CHARLES KETTLES TO THIS MORNING RECEIVED THE MEDAL OF HONOR FOR
HIS HAIR WAS IN VIETNAM.
[CHEERING] ABSOLUTELY.
[CHEERING] I WOULD DO THAT MR. TRUMP ARE
ASKING ME TO BE HERE TONIGHT. I CAN TELL YOU HOW MUCH OF AN
HONOR IT IS TO STAND UP.
AND TALK ABOUT A MAN THAT I TRUST WITH THE LIVES OF MY FAMILY AND THE HEALTH OF OUR
COUNTRY.
[CHEERING] AMERICA, THE GREATEST COUNTRY
GOT EVER CREATED.
-- GOD EVER CREATED. NOW, AMERICA IS AN EASY PLACE TO GET TO. FOR YOU FIRST-TIME VOTERS, IT IS
IMPORTANT FOR YOU TO KNOW WHAT IT MEANS TO BE AN AMERICAN. IT DOES NOT MEAN GETTING FREE
STUFF.
[CHEERING] IT MEANS SACRIFICING, WINNING, LOSING, FAILING, SUCCEEDING AND
SOMETIMES DOING THE THINGS YOU
DON'T WANT TO DO, INCLUDING THE HARD WORK IN ORDER TO GET WHERE
YOU WANT TO BE. THAT WHAT IT MEANS TO BE AN AMERICAN.
[CHEERING] FOLKS, OUR COUNTRY IS A VERY BAD SPOT.
YOU CAN FEEL IT AND YOU CAN SEE
IT EVERYWHERE. THERE IS NO STABILITY. NOTHING SEEMS RIGHT. ALL THE THINGS THAT WE HOLD DEAR
ARE BEING ATTACKED EVERY SINGLE
DAY. WE CANNOT GO DOWN THIS ROAD ANYMORE, WE NEED TO STOP. MANY DONALD TRUMP TO FIX THIS -- WE NEED DONALD TRUMP TO FIX
THIS.
[CHEERING] IS DONALD TRUMP A MESSIAH, NO.
JUST A MAN. A MAN WHO WAS TO GET BACK TO HIS COUNTRY, AMERICA. THE COUNTRY THAT HAS GIVEN HIM EVERYTHING.
A COUNTRY THAT HAS ALSO GIVEN
ALL OF US SO MUCH, AND NOW DOES
TEND TO GET BACK TO HER.
-- TIME TO GET BACK TO HER.
WE HAVE A CHOICE IN NOVEMBER.
WE CAN GO FOR HILLARY CLINTON --
>> BOO!
>> I AGREE. WHO WAS TO CONTINUE THE SAME POLICIES THAT ARE WRECKING THIS
COUNTRY. POLICIES THAT MAKE US UNSAFE. A WOMAN WHO SOMEHOW FEELS SHE IS
ENTITLED TO THE PRESIDENCY. THAT SHE IS SOMEHOW OWED IT.
OR WE CAN VOTE FOR DONALD TRUMP.
[CHEERING] A MAN DOING THIS FROM THE GOODNESS OF HIS HEART AND
GENUINELY WANTS TO HELP. A MAN WHO KNOWS HOW TO GET THINGS DONE.
A MAN WHO SAYS WHAT HE MEANS AND
MEANS WHAT HE SAYS. HILLARY CLINTON WANTS TO BE PRESIDENT FOR HILLARY CLINTON. DONALD TRUMP WAS TO BE PRESIDENT
FOR ALL OF US.
[CHEERING] OF COURSE, LET'S MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. BUT LET'S MAKE AMERICA AMERICA AGAIN.
[CHEERING] THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH. GOD BLESS AND GO TRUMP! GOOD NIGHT!
