<strong>Scott Walker</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> MY FELLOW AMERICANS, YOU HAVE A CHOICE, YOU DESERVE BETTER
BECAUSE AMERICA DESERVES BETTER. THE WELL-CONNECTED IN WASHINGTON
ARE STANDING BEHIND HILLARY<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> CLINTON BECAUSE HILLARY CLINTON
IS ONE OF THEM. THEY WANT MORE OF THE SAME. DONALD TRUMP IS STANDING WITH
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, WE WANT A
LEADER WHO IS NOT AFRAID TO TAKE
ON THE MESS IN WASHINGTON. DONALD TRUMP KNOWS THAT THERE A
BETTER WAY FORWARD AND WE
BELIEVE AS REPUBLICANS, WE BELIEVE IN A RIMER CAP WHERE EVERYONE CAN GET THE EDUCATION AND TRAINING THAT THEY NEED TO
SUCCEED IN COLLEGE, AND CAREER
AND IN LIFE. WHERE WASHINGTON DOES NOT DEEPEN DEPENDENCY, BUT RATHER HELPS CREATE GENUINE OPPORTUNITY. WHY? BECAUSE AMERICA DESERVES BETTER.
[CHEERING] WE BELIEVE IN A COUNTRY WHERE WE
CAN ACHIEVE, MAINTAIN AND ENJOY
THEIR PIECE OF THE AMERICAN
DREAM WITHOUT GOVERNMENT STAND
IN THE WAY. BECAUSE AMERICA DESERVES BETTER. WE BELIEVE IN A COUNTRY WHERE WE
TAKE THE THREAT OF TERRORISM SERIOUSLY. WE NAME IT FOR WHAT IT IS, YOU
KNOW THE WORDS. RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM! AND WE DO EVERYTHING IN OUR
POWER TO ELIMINATE IT.
TO ENSURE OUR SAFETY. WHY? BECAUSE AMERICA DESERVES BETTER. WE BELIEVE IN A COUNTRY WHERE
THERE IS A RESPONSIBILITY TO
DELIVER TO OUR TROOPS THE SUPPORT AND TOOLS THAT THEY NEED TO ACHIEVE ABSOLUTE VICTORY AND
THEN PROVIDE THEM WITH THE HEALTH CARE AND THE RESPECT THAT
THEY HAVE EARNED WHEN THEY
RETURN HOME. LET'S THANK OUR VETERANS.
[CHEERING] WHY, BECAUSE AMERICA DESERVES BETTER. WHILE WE ARE AT IT, WE BELIEVE
IN A COUNTRY WHERE THOSE WHO
HONORABLY SERVE IN LAW
ENFORCEMENT, THE PEOPLE WHO PUT
THEIR LIVES ON THE LINE FOR US
EACH AND EVERY DAY ARE NOT JUST RESPECTED, THE REVERED -- BUT REVERED. WHY? BECAUSE AMERICA DESERVES BETTER. WE BELIEVE IN A COUNTRY WHERE
POWER IS TAKEN BACK FROM
WASHINGTON AND RETURN HOME TO HOME STATE AND GOVERNMENT. MORE EFFECTIVE, MORE EFFICIENT AND MORE ACCOUNTABLE TO THE PEOPLE.
WHY? BECAUSE AMERICA DESERVES BETTER. WE BELIEVE IN A COUNTRY WHERE
FREEDOM AND PERSONAL SUCCESS DO NOT COME FROM THE CLUMSY HANDS OF GOVERNMENT, BUT RATHER FROM
THE DIGNITY THAT COMES FROM HARD
WORK. WHY? BECAUSE AMERICA DESERVES BETTER. THE SIMPLE TRUTH IS LIBERAL WASHINGTON INSIDERS CREATED OUR PROBLEMS AND HILLARY CLINTON IS
THE ULTIMATE LIBERAL WASHINGTON
INSIDER. IF SHE WERE ANYMORE ON THE INSIDE, SHE WOULD BE IN PRISON.
[CHEERING] AMERICA DESERVES BETTER THAN
HILLARY CLINTON.
[CHEERING] AND THAT, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
IS WHY WE NEED TO SUPPORT DONALD TRUMP AND MIKE PENCE TO BE THE
NEXT PRESIDENT AND NEXT VICE
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.
[CHEERING] LAST AUGUST, RIGHT HERE IN CLEVELAND, I SIT ON THE STAGE
AND I SAID THAT ANY OF THE REPUBLICANS RUNNING FOR OFFICE
WOULD BE BETTER THAN HILLARY
CLINTON. I MEANT IT BEEN AND I MEAN IT
NOW. LET ME BE CLEAR, A VOTE FOR ANYONE OTHER THAN DONALD TRUMP
IN  NOVEMBER IS A VOTE FOR HILLARY CLINTON.
[CHEERING] MAKE NO MISTAKE, WE CAN'T WAIT FOR YEARS TO GET THEM NEXT TIME. THE CONSEQUENCES ARE TOO GREAT. LITERALLY, JUST AN HOUR AGO A
WAITING TO GO ON STAGE, I WAS ON THE PHONE WITH DONALD TRUMP AND
THE SUBJECT CAME UP.
THINK ABOUT IT, THE SUPREME
COURT, HE AND I TALKED ABOUT THE
COURT, HE RAISED THAT AS A CONCERN AND WE TALKED ABOUT THE FACT THAT RONALD REAGAN NOMINATED JUSTICE SCALIA OVER 30
YEARS AGO TO BE ON THE COURT WHEN I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL, WE CANNOT CONCEDE THE COURT TO
LIBERALS LIKE HILLARY CLINTON
FOR THE NEXT 30 YEARS.
[CHEERING] THE CONSEQUENCES ARE TOO GREAT. AFTER HEARING THE FBI DIRECTORS
REPORT A FEW WEEKS AGO, I
LISTENED TO THAT AND SAID, I
WOULD NOT EVEN GIVE HILLARY CLINTON THE PASSWORD TO MY IPHONE, LET ALONE ACCESS TO HIGHLY CLASSIFIED INFORMATION.
[CHEERING] THIS IS NOT JUST ANOTHER CLINTON SCANDAL, HILLARY SCANDAL PUT OUR
NATIONAL SECURITY AT RISK AND
THAT, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, MAY HILLARY CLINTON UNFIT TO BE
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED
STATES.
[CHEERING] IT IS TIME TO TELL HILLARY
ENOUGH IS ENOUGH. NO MORE DOUBLE STANDARDS FOR THE
CLINTONS.
[CHEERING] WHY? BECAUSE AMERICA DESERVES BETTER. THANKFULLY, REPUBLICANS ARE
OFFERING A BETTER WAY FORWARD. IT IS WORKING RIGHT HERE IN OHIO
AND IT IS WORKING IN PLACES LIKE FLORIDA AND NEW MEXICO AND NORTH
CAROLINA AND SOUTH CAROLINA. IT IS EVEN WORKING IN PLACES
LIKE MASSACHUSETTS AND MARYLAND BECAUSE AMERICAN -- REPUBLICAN LEADERSHIP WORKS.
[CHEERING] I KNOW. I SEE IT FIRSTHAND AS IT IS WORKING EVERYTHING WILL DAY IN WISCONSIN.
-- EVERY SINGLE DAY IN
WISCONSIN.
IN 2010, WE WERE TIRED OF HIGH
ON THE PLYMOUTH. BUDGET DEFICITS, STIFLING TAXES AND RISING COLLEGE TUITION. MOST OF ALL, WE WERE TIRED OF
THE BIG GOVERNMENT UNION BOSSES
RUNNING OUR STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS.
WE HAVE HAD ENOUGH. WE DID SOMETHING ABOUT IT. WE TOOK THE POWER FROM THE HANDS OF THE BIG GOVERNMENT SPECIAL INTERESTS AND RETURNED IT TO THE
HANDS OF THE HARD-WORKING
TAXPAYERS.
[CHEERING] YOU REMEMBER IN TERMS OF THE BIG GOVERNMENT BOSSES AND WASHINGTON MORE THAN 100,000 PROTESTERS WHO
OCCUPIED OUR STATE CAPITAL.
THEY TRIED TO INTIMIDATE US WITH
THREATS AND MOBS, BUT WE DID NOT
BACK DOWN.
AND WE WON. THEY SPENT TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TRYING TO DEFEAT US IN A RECALL ELECTION, BUT WE DID NOT ACT NOW.
AND WE WANT.
-- BACK DOWN. AND WE WON. THREE TIMES THEY CAME AT US AND
THREE TIMES WE WON.
WE WON BECAUSE OUR COMMON SENSE REFORMS WORK.
TODAY MORE PEOPLE ARE EMPLOYED
IN WISCONSIN THAN EVER BEFORE.
OUR BUDGET IS BALANCED AND
RESPONSIBLE. TAXES ARE DOWN FOR WORKING
FAMILIES AND SENIORS. AND COLLEGE TUITION FOR THE
FIRST TIME EVER IS FROZEN FOUR
YEARS IN A ROW. CONSERVATIVE FORMS CAN WORK IN A BLUE STATE LIKE MINE, THEY CAN
WORK ANYWHERE IN THE COUNTRY.
[CHEERING] YOU SEE, IT WAS NOT TOO LATE FOR WISCONSIN AND IT IS NOT TOO LATE FOR AMERICA. IF YOU HAVE HAD ENOUGH OF WASHINGTON'S BROKENNESS, OF
THEIR WASTEFULNESS, OF
WASHINGTON'S EMPTY PROMISES AND
OF WASHINGTON'S ARROGANCE, I
INVITE YOU HERE AND ACROSS AMERICA TO JOIN US, ELECT US -- HELP US ELECT REPUBLICANS TO
OFFICE FROM THE COURTHOUSE TO
THE STATE HOUSE AND THE WHITE HOUSE.
AMERICA, YOU HAVE A CHOICE. YOU DECIDE.
YOU DESERVE BETTER BECAUSE
AMERICA DESERVES BETTER. WHY? BECAUSE AMERICA DESERVES BETTER! WHY? BECAUSE AMERICA DESERVES BETTER. GOD BLESS YOU AND THANK YOU AND
GOD BLESS OUR NECK PRESIDENT AND
VICE PRESIDENT.
[CHEERING]

<strong>Unidentified Speaker</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> TODAY I WAS COMPELLED TO SIT DOWN AND WRITE THIS LETTER. NOT TO ANYONE IN PARTICULAR,
MAYBE EVEN JUST FOR MYSELF. THAT COME FAMILY THAT I KNOW IS
WITHOUT<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> QUESTION ONE OF THE MOST
GENEROUS AND COMPASSIONATE AND PHILANTHROPIC FAMILIES I'VE EVER
HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF KNOWING AND
BEYOND TO CALL FRIENDS. THEY HAVE BEEN INCREDIBLE LOYAL TO ME AND TO THE COUNTLESS
DEDICATED TO THE BAND PLAY
AROUND WITH. HIRING MORE MINORITIES IN CHEMO EXECUTIVES AND ANY OTHER
COMPANY. REST ASSURED, I'M A HIGHLY INTELLIGENT FREETHINKING AND
INDEPENDENT WOMAN. MY OPINIONS AND DECISIONS ARE
BASED SOLELY ON FACTS. NONFICTION, SPECULATION, ASSUMPTION OR HEARSAY. I DO NOT VOTE BASED UPON THE
COLOR OF MY SKIN NOR THE
SIGNATURE ON THE PAYCHECK. I JUDGE MY FRIENDS AND FORGE MY ALLEGIANCES THROUGH INTERACTIONS. THAT SAID, THERE IS NO HIGHER BROADER BY WHICH TO MEASURE ONESELF THAN THE ONE CONTINUALLY SET BY THE TRUMP FAMILY. THE TRUMP FAMILY HAS TO BUY ME
THROUGH MANY DIFFICULT TIMES
WITHOUT HESITATION OR CONCERN
FOR THEIR OWN REPUTATION BY
ASSOCIATION. THEY CONTINUE TO TRUST ME WITH
EVERY ASPECT OF THEIR LIVES AND THE LIVES OF THEIR FAMILIES. THEY INVITE ME TO THE HOME AND WELCOMING AT THE FAMILY
GATHERING. THE PAST SIX YEARS I FELT AN EXECUTIVE POSITION AS A PERTAINS
TO THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE
INTERNAL FUNDS AND HAVE CHARGED
ME TO IDENTIFY WORTHY AN ULTRA
STICK MISSIONS.
I CANNOT BE MORE HUMBLED. THIS IS THE TRUMP FAMILY THAT I
KNOW. THERE IS A MOVEMENT SWEEPING
THIS BRAVE NATION AND I'M
HONORED TO HAVE A FRONT ROW
SEAT. THIS COUNTRY HAS SPOKEN. MY BOSS HAS SPURNED THE
REPUBLICAN NOMINATION AND THE VOTER REGISTRATION RECORD IN
COUNTLESS STATES ACROSS AMERICA.
THIS CANNOT BE DENIED. HE HAS OPTED -- BROUGHT THE PARTY TOGETHER. HE HAS EARNED MORE REPUBLICAN VOTES THAN ANY OTHER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE IN MODERN HISTORY. THAT MUST BE RESPECTED. TO THE SKEPTICS WHO WILL
UNDOUBTEDLY CLAIM I'M DOING THIS
AT THE BEHEST OF THE TRUMP
FAMILY COME WITH THE PROMISE OF REWARD, I GLIBLY CHOSE -- ACETATE CANCELED. AND THE POTENTIAL BUYER RAMIFICATION. AND THERE WOULD BE FOR
THEMSELVES IN THE FACT THAT THIS
IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO. FOR ME, IT WAS NOT A TOUGH
DECISION. JUST LIKE VOTING FOR MY BOSS
SHOULD BE AN EASY DECISION FOR
YOU.
GOD BLESS THE FAMILY AND GOD
BLESS THE VOTERS AND GOT BUT THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.
