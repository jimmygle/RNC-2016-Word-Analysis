<strong>Carrie Almond</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> GOOD AFTERNOON, FELLOW
REPUBLICANS. WHAT A THRILL TO BE HERE IN
CLEVELAND, REP RESENTING THE LARGEST WOMEN'S POLITICAL GROUP
IN THE COUNTRY. IN 2014,<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> OUR MEMBERS DONATED OVER 4.2 MILLION CAMPAIGN VOLUNTEER HOURS. AND THIS YEAR, WE ARE SO COMMITTED TO PUTTING A
REPUBLICAN IN THE WHITE HOUSE THAT FOR THE PAST TWO MONTHS, I HAVE TRAVELED THE COUNTRY IN A
RED, WHITE AND BLUE RV NAMED
ROSIE AFTER MY GRANDMOTHER. WE HAVE COVERED 11,000 MILES, 23 STATES AND WE ARE NOT RESTING
UNTIL ELECTION DAY. FROM NEBRASKA TO NEW HAMPSHIRE, ACROSS OHIO, WISCONSIN AND LOUISIANA, HERE IS WHAT I AM
HEARING. HILLARY CLINTON DOES NOT FOR ALL
WOMEN.
[APPLAUSE] SHE DOES NOT SPEAK FOR THE WOMEN IN KENNY BUNK MAY WHO TOLD ME
GET OUT THERE AND TELL EVERYONE WOMEN SUPPORT DONALD TRUMP. OR FOR THE YOUNG NAVY RECRUIT WHO KNOCKED ON OUR DOOR AND ASKED TO SIGN OUR RV IN AN
INDIANA PARKING LOT. HILLARY CLINTON DOESN'T SPEAK FOR THE WOMEN WE MEET EVERY DAY DEMANDING WE GET REPUBLICANS UNITED BEHIND THE NOMINEE.
[APPLAUSE] BACK IN MARCH, THE NATIONAL
DURATION OF REPUBLICAN WOMEN
TOOK THE LEAD IN PASSING A UNITY
RESOLUTION. WOMEN, AFTER ALL, ARE THE ONES
WHO UNIFY THE FAMILY. WE ARE HERE TO UNIFY THE PARTY.
[APPLAUSE] TO EVERY WOMAN HERE IN CLEVELAND AND ALL OF YOU WATCHING, THERE
IS A PLACE FOR YOU AT OUR TABLE. GET ON BOARD.
[APPLAUSE]</span><span class='hidden-full-transcript-ellipses'>...</span></p><a href='#' class='hidden-full-transcript-link'><i class='icon-chevron-down'></i> <span class='link-show-full-text'>Show Full Text</span><i class='icon-chevron-up'></i> <span class='link-show-less-text'>Show Less Text</span></a>
