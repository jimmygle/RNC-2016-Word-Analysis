<strong>David Avella</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> ARISTOTLE WAS RIGHT WHEN HE SAID THE WHOLE IS GREATER THAN
THE SUM OF ITS PARTS. SO IT IS WITH OUR REPUBLICAN PARTY. EVERY PART, EVERY OFFICE, EVERY
LEVEL<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> OF GOVERNMENT DETERMINES
THE STRENGTH OF THE WHOLE.
THINK ABOUT THAT. EVERY OFFICE AND EVERY LEVEL OF
GOVERNMENT DETERMINES THE
STRENGTH OF THE WHOLE. THUS, WE ARE HERE AND PUT IN CHARGE OF ELECTING DONALD TRUMP
AS PRESIDENT AND MIKE PENCE AS
VICE PRESIDENT AND GIVING THEM
REPUBLICAN PARTNERS AT ALL
LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT.
[APPLAUSE] 438 YEARS, GO PAC HAS LED IN
ENERGIZING AND ELECT THERE'S -- ELECTING GENERATIONS OF
REPUBLICAN LEADERS. 34 OF 50 REPUBLICAN GOVERNORS AND 69 OF 99 STATE LEGISLATIVE CHAMBERS. YOU MIGHT RECOGNIZE SOME OF OUR
ALUMNI. U.S. SENATORS JONI ERNST, THOM TILLIS, AND MARCO RUBIO. EACH IS A SHINING EXAMPLE OF WHY
THE FUTURE OF THE CONSERVATIVE MOVEMENT IS STRONGER THAN EVER. REPUBLICANS ARE CHAMPIONING IDEAS TO MAKE AMERICA SAFER, BOTH ON PERSONAL AND ECONOMIC
SECURITY. AS ELECTION DAY APPROACHES, WE MUST MAKE IT CRYSTAL CLEAR THAT UNLIKE HILLARY CLINTON, WE ARE
FOR A TAX SYSTEM THAT TAKES LESS
FROM AMERICANS SO THEY CAN
INVEST AND ENJOY THEIR HARD-EARNED MONEY. WE ARE FOR INDIVIDUALS HAVING THE CAREER FLEXIBILITY TO CHART
THEIR OWN COURSE AND PERHAPS INVENT SOMETHING THAT WOULD
CHANGE THE WORLD. WE ARE FOR INCREASING OUR CYBER
SECURITY EFFORTS TO PREVENT TAX THAT TARGET OUR NATION'S INFRASTRUCTURE AND EXPOSE OUR
PERSONAL DATA. WE ARE FOR PROTECTING OUR COMMUNITIES AND HEINOUS AND
UNNECESSARY ATTACKS AND, UNLIKE HILLARY CLINTON, WE ARE FOR
SECURING OUR BORDERS, DEFUNDING SANCTUARY CITIES AND DEPORTING
THOSE WHO COMMIT CRIME. THESE IDEALS ARE WHAT AMERICANS WANT AS THEY DIRECTLY IMPACT AND
IMPROVE OUR LIVES. WITH DONALD TRUMP AS PRESIDENT
AND REPUBLICANS AT ALL LEVELS OF
GOVERNMENT, THE SUM OF OUR PARTS WILL, AS A WHOLE, MAKE AMERICA
SAFER THAN IT HAS EVER BEEN. THANK YOU.

<strong>Kimberly Yee</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> PLEASE WELCOME ARIZONA STATE SENATOR, KIMBERLY YEE. GOOD AFTERNOON. MY NAME IS KIMBERLY YEE AND I REPRESENT THE GREAT STATE OF
ARIZONA. I'M THE DAUGHTER<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> OF A PUBLIC SCHOOL TEACHER AND SMALL
BUSINESS OWNER. MY DAUGHTER WHO PROUDLY SERVED
IN THE U.S. ARMY IS HERE WITH ME
TODAY FOR -- WITH ME TODAY.
[APPLAUSE] LIKE MANY CHINESE-AMERICANS, MY
STORY STARTS WITH MY GREAT GREAT GRANDFATHER WHO CAME TO THE
UNITED STATES AT THE TURN OF THE
20TH CENTURY. FOR ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY. HE OPENED A HAND LAUNDRY
BUSINESS.
HIS SON AND TWO GENERATIONS LATER, HIS GRANDSON WOULD RUN
THEIR OWN FAMILY BUSINESS. MY PARENTS TAUGHT ME THAT I
COULD ACHIEVE ANYTHING I WANTED
IN THIS GREAT COUNTRY. THOUGH THEY WOULD NEVER HAVE
IMAGINED I WOULD BECOME THE
FIRST ASIAN-AMERICAN WOMAN TO BE
ELECTED TO THE STATE LEGISLATURE
IN ARIZONA'S HISTORY. THANK YOU. IT'S BECAUSE OF THE UNLIMITED
OPPORTUNITIES THAT ONLY AMERICA
AFFORDS THAT I HUMBLY STAND
BEFORE YOU TODAY. I REPRESENT THE VALUES OF EVERY DAY, HARD-WORKING AMERICANS WHO
ASPIRE TO ACHIEVE IN ORDER TO -- ASPIRE TO SUCCEED IN ORDER TO
ACHIEVE THE AMERICAN DREAM.
, DAUGHTER, MOTHER, AND SMALL
BUSINESS OWNER. I BRING TO THESE ROLES BY JOB AS
A CITIZEN LEGISLATOR
REPRESENTING MY CONSTITUENT, FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS. WE CANNOT SPEND MORE THAN WE
MAKE. WE MUST DEFEND OUR FREEDOMS AT
HOME AND ABROAD. WE SHOULD VALUE AND PROTECT
LIFE. OUR BUSINESSES RUN BEST WHEN GOVERNMENT INTERVENES THE LEAST. THESE ARE THE PRINCIPLES I HOLD
DEAR AND I WILL TEACH MY
CHILDREN. IT IS TIME FOR US TO GET BACK TO OUR CONSERVATIVE, REPUBLICAN VALUES THAT HAVE MADE OUR NATION
GREAT. WE CANNOT ENDURE THE NEXT FOUR YEARS LIKE WE HAVE THE PAST EIGHT. IT IS BECAUSE OF THESE PRINCIPLES THAT I SUPPORT DONALD
J TRUMP FOR PRESIDENT. THANK YOU AND MAY GOD BLESS
AMERICA.
