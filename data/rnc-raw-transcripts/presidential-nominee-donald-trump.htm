<strong>Ivanka Trump</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> GOOD EVENING.
[CHEERING] THANK YOU. ONE YEAR AGO I ENTERED IS MY FATHER WHEN HE DECLARED HIS
CANDIDACY. IN HIS OWN WAY ANSWER HIS OWN SHEER FORCE OF<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> WILL, HE SACRIFICED GREATLY TO ENTER THE POLITICAL ARENA AS AN OUTSIDER.
AND HE PREVAILED AGAINST A FIELD OF 16 VERY TALENTED COMPETITORS.
[CHEERING] FOR MORE THAN A YEAR, DONALD
TRUMP HAS BEEN THE PEOPLE'S
CHAMPION. AND TONIGHT, HE IS THE PEOPLE'S
NOMINEE.
[CHEERING] LIKE MANY OF MY FELLOW
MILLENNIALS, I DO NOT CONSIDER MYSELF CATEGORICALLY REPUBLICAN
OR DEMOCRAT. MORE THAN PARTY, I VOTE BASED ON
WHAT I BELIEVE IS RIGHT FOR MY
FAMILY AND MY COUNTRY. SOMETIMES IT IS A TOUGH CHOICE. THAT IS NOT THE CASE THIS TIME. A PROUD DAUGHTER OF YOUR
NOMINEE, I'M HERE TO TELL YOU
THAT THIS IS A MOMENT AND DONALD
TRUMP IS THE PERSON TO MAKE
AMERICA GREAT AGAIN.
[CHEERING] REAL CHANGE, THE KINDLY IN A DECADES IS ONLY GOING TO COME FROM OUTSIDE THE SYSTEM AND IT
IS ONLY GOING TO COME FROM A MAN
WHO IS SPENT HIS ENTIRE LIFE
DOING WHAT OTHERS SAID CANNOT BE DONE. MY FATHER IS A FIGHTER. WHEN THE PRIMARIES GOT TOUGH,
AND THEY WERE TOP, HE DID WHAT ANY GREAT LEADER DOES, HE DUG DEEPER, WORKED HARDER, GOT BETTER AND BECAME STRONGER.
[CHEERING] I HAVE SEEN HIM FIGHT FOR HIS
FAMILY. I HAVE SEEN HIM FIGHT FOR HIS
EMPLOYEES. I HAVE SEEN HIM FIGHT FOR HIS COMPANY AND NOW I AM SEEING HIM
FIGHT FOR OUR COUNTRY.
[CHEERING] IT IS THE STORY OF HIS LIFE AND
MORE RECENTLY, THE SPIRIT OF HIS
CAMPAIGN.
IT IS ALSO A PRELUDE TO REACHING
THE GOAL THAT UNITES US ALL. WHEN -- THIS PARTY AND BETTER
STILL THIS COUNTRY KNOWS WHAT IT
IS LIKE TO WIN AGAIN.
[CHEERING] POSSIBLE TO BE FAMOUS AND NOT WELL KNOWN, THAT DESCRIBES THE
FATHER WHO RAISED ME. IN THE SAME OFFICE OF TRUCK TIRE WHERE WE -- TRUMP TOWER WHERE WE
WORK TOGETHER, REPLAY AND ON THE
FOR NEXT MY FATHER'S DESK CONSTRUCTING MINIATURE BUILDINGS WITH LEGOS WHILE HE DID THE SAME WITH CONCRETE, STEEL AND GLASS. MY FATHER TAUGHT MY SIBLINGS AND ME THE IMPORTANCE OF POSITIVE
VALUES IN A STRONG ETHICAL
COMPASS. HE SHOWED US HOW TO BE
RESILIENT, HOW TO DEAL WITH CHALLENGES AND HOW TO STRIVE FOR
EXCELLENCE IN ALL THAT WE DO.
HE TAUGHT US THAT THERE IS
NOTHING WE CANNOT ACCOMPLISH IF
WE MARRIED VISION AND PASSION
WITH AN ENDURING WORK ETHIC.
[CHEERING] ONE OF MY FATHER'S GREATEST
TALENTS IS HIS ABILITY TO SEE POTENTIAL IN PEOPLE BEFORE THEY SEATED HIMSELF -- THEMSELVES.
HE TAUGHT US THAT POTENTIAL
MANAGERS INTO NOTHING WITHOUT
EFFORT. AND THAT LIKE HIM, WE EACH HAD A RESPONSIBILITY TO WORK NOT JUST
FOR OURSELVES, BUT FOR THE BETTERMENT OF THE WORLD AROUND US.
[CHEERING] OVER THE YEARS, ON TOO MANY
OCCASIONS TO COME, I SAW MY FATHER CARE STORIES OUT OF THE
NEWSPAPER ABOUT PEOPLE AND HE HAD NEVER MET WERE FACING INJUSTICE OR HARDSHIP. WROTE A NOTE TO HIS ASSISTANT
AND A SIGNATURE PEN AND
REQUESTED THAT THE PERSON BE FOUND AND INVITED TO COME POWER TO MEET WITH HIM.
HE WOULD TALK TO THEM AND DRAW A POUND -- UPON HIS EXTENSIVE NETWORKING ON THEM A JOB OR GET A BREAK.
THEY WOULD LEAVE HIS OFFICE AS
PEOPLE SO OFTEN DO AFTER HAVING BEEN WITH DONALD TRUMP FEELING THAT LIFE COULD BE GREAT AGAIN. THROUGHOUT MY ENTIRE LIFE, EYEWITNESSES EMPATHY AND
GENEROSITY TOWARDS OTHER,
ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO ARE
SUFFERING.
IT IS JUST HIS WAY OF BEING IN
YOUR CORNER WHEN YOU ARE DOWN. MY FATHER NOT ONLY HAS THE STRENGTH AND ABILITY NECESSARY TO BE THE NEXT PRESIDENT, BUT ALSO THE KINDNESS AND COMPASSION THAT WILL ENABLE HIM TO BE THE
LEADER THAT THIS COUNTRY NEEDS.
[CHEERING] MY FATHER HAS A SENSE OF FAIRNESS THAT TOUCHES EVERY CONVICTION HE HOLDS.
I WORKED ALONGSIDE HIM FOR MORE
THAN A DECADE NOW AT THE TRUMP
ORGANIZATION I HAVE SEEN HOW HE
OPERATES AS A LEADER MAKING IMPORTANT DECISIONS THAT SHAPE CAREERS AND CHANGE LIVES. I HAVE LEARNED A LOT ABOUT THE
WORLD FROM WALKING CONSTRUCTION JOBS DOWN BY HIS SIDE. WHEN RUN PROPERLY, CONSTRUCTION SITES ARE TRUE MERITOCRACY. COMPETENCE IN THE BUILDING TRADE
IS EASY TO SPOT AND INCOMPETENCE IS IMPOSSIBLE TO HIDE.
[CHEERING] THESE SITES ARE ALSO INCREDIBLE MELTING POTS GATHERING PEOPLE
FROM ALL WALKS OF LIFE AND UNITING THEM TO WORK TOWARDS A
SINGLE MISSION. THERE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN MEN OF
ALL BACKGROUNDS AND ETHNICITIES ON MY FATHER'S JOB SITES AND LONG BEFORE IT WAS COMMONPLACE HE ALSO SAW WOMEN.
[CHEERING] MY FATHER VALUES TALENT.
HE RECOGNIZES REAL KNOWLEDGE AND
SKILL WHEN HE FINDS IT.
HE IS COLORBLIND AND GENDER-NEUTRAL.
[CHEERING] HE HAS THE BEST PERSON FOR THE JOB.
. WORDS AND PROMISES, THE MATTER
HOW VISIONARY THEY SOUND WILL
ONLY GET YOU SO FAR. IN OUR VISION, YOU ARE NOT A BUILDER UNLESS YOU HAVE A
BUILDING TO SHOW FOR IT.
OR IN MY FATHER'S CASE, CITY SKYLINE'S.
[CHEERING] MOST PEOPLE STRIVE THEIR ENTIRE
LIVES TO ACHIEVE GREAT SUCCESS
IN A SINGLE INDUSTRY. MY FATHER HAS SUCCEEDED IN MANY
ON THE HIGHEST LEVEL AND ON A GLOBAL SCALE. ONE OF THE REASONS HE STRIVES AS AN ENTREPRENEUR IS BECAUSE HE LISTENS TO EVERYONE. BILLIONAIRE EXECUTIVES DON'T
USUALLY ASK THE PEOPLE DOING THE
WORK FOR THEIR OPINIONS OF THE
WORK. MY FATHER IS AN EXCEPTION. ON EVERY ONE OF HIS PROJECTS YOU
WILL SEE HIM TALKING TO THE
SUPER, THE PAINTER, THE ELECTRICIAN, HE WILL ASK THEM
FOR THEIR FEEDBACK. IF THEY THINK SOMETHING SHOULD BE DONE DIFFERENTLY OR COULD BE DONE BETTER.
ONE DONALD TRUMP IS IN CHARGE HIM ALL THAT COUNTS HIS ABILITY, EFFORT AND EXCELLENCE.
[CHEERING] THIS HAS LONG BEEN THE PHILOSOPHY OF THE TRUMP
ORGANIZATION. MY FATHER'S COMPANY, THERE ARE
MORE FEMALE THAN MALE EXECUTIVES. WOMEN ARE PAID EQUALLY FOR THE
WORK THAT WE DO AND WHEN A WOMAN
BECOMES A MOTHER SHE IS SUPPORTED, NOT SHUT OUT.
[CHEERING] WOMEN REPRESENT 46% OF THE TOTAL U.S. LABOR FORCE AND 40% OF
AMERICAN HOUSEHOLDS HAVE FEMALE
PRIMARY BREADWINNERS. IN 2014, WOMEN MADE $.83 FOR
EVERY DOLLAR EARNED BY A MAN. SINGLE WOMEN WITHOUT CHILDREN EARNED $.94 WHEREAS MARRIED MOTHERS MADE ONLY $.77. AS RESEARCHERS HAVE NOTED,
GENDER IS NO LONGER A FACTOR CREATING THE GREATEST WAGE DISCREPANCY, MOTHERHOOD IS. AS PRESIDENT, MY FATHER WILL CHANGE THE LABOR LAWS THAT WERE PUT IN PLACE AT A TIME WHEN
WOMEN WERE UP A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE WORKFORCE. HE WILL FOCUS ON MAKING QUALITY
CHILD CARE AFFORDABLE AND ACCESSIBLE FOR ALL.
[CHEERING] AS A MOTHER MYSELF OF THREE
YOUNG CHILDREN, I KNOW HOW HARD
IT IS TO WORK WHILE RAISING A
FAMILY.
I ALSO KNOW THAT I'M FAR MORE
FORTUNATE THAN MOST. AMERICAN FAMILIES NEEDED RELIEF. POLICIES THAT ALLOW WOMEN WITH
CHILDREN TO THRIVE SHOULD NOT BE NOVELTIES, THEY SHOULD BE THE
NORM. POLITICIANS TALK ABOUT WAGE EQUALITY, BUT MY FATHER HAS MADE
IT A PRACTICE AT HIS COMPANY THROUGHOUT HIS ENTIRE CAREER.
[CHEERING] HE WILL FIGHT FOR EQUAL PAY,
EQUAL WORK AND I WILL FIGHT FOR THIS RIGHT ALONGSIDE OF HIM.
[CHEERING]
>> TRUMP, TRUMP, TRUMP!
>> AMERICANS TODAY NEED AN
ECONOMY THAT PERMITS PEOPLE TO
RISE AGAIN. A TRUMP PRESIDENCY WILL TURN THE ECONOMY AROUND AND RESTORE THE GREAT AMERICAN TRADITION OF
GIVING EACH NEW GENERATION HOPE FOR BRIGHTER OPPORTUNITIES AND
THOSE OF THE GENERATION THAT
CAME BEFORE. AND DONALD TRUMP, YOU HAVE A CANDIDATE WHO KNOWS THE
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WANTING SOMETHING DONE AND MAKING IT
HAPPEN.
[CHEERING] WHEN MY FATHER SAYS THAT HE WILL
BUILD A TOWER, KEEP AN EYE ON THE SKYLINE. 4 X 4, A SOARING STRUCTURE WILL
APPEAR, USUALLY RECORD SETTING AND ICONIC IN ITS DESIGN. REAL PEOPLE ARE HIRED TO DO REAL
WORK.
VISION BECOMES REALITY. WHEN MY FATHER SAID THAT HE WILL
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, HE WILL DELIVER.
[CHEERING] WE HAVE A CHANCE THIS YEAR TO
RECLAIM OUR HERITAGE OF THE
COUNTRY THAT CARRIES BIG AND
MAKES THE IMPOSSIBLE HAPPENED. FORTUNATELY, DONALD TRUMP IS
INCAPABLE OF THINKING SMALL. WHEN I WAS A CHILD, MY FATHER
ALWAYS TOLD ME, IF YOU'RE GOING
TO BE THINKING ANYWAY, YOU MIGHT
AS WELL THINK BIG. AS PRESIDENT, MY FATHER WILL TAKE ON THE BOLD AND WORTHY
FIGHT.
HE WILL BE UNAFRAID TO SET LOFTY
GOALS AND HE WILL BE RELENTLESS
IN HIS DETERMINATION TO ACHIEVE THEM. TO PEOPLE ALL OVER AMERICA, I SAID, WHEN YOU HAVE MY FATHER AND YOUR CORNER, YOU WILL NEVER AGAIN HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT BEING
LET DOWN.
HE WILL FIGHT FOR YOU ALL THE
TIME, ALL THE WAY, EVERY TIME.
[CHEERING] MAYBE IT IS THE DEVELOPER AND
HIM, BUT DONALD TRUMP CANNOT
STAND TO SEE EMPTY MAIN STREET
AND BOARDED UP FACTORIES. HE CAN'T BEAR THE INJUSTICE OF
COLLEGE GRADUATES WHO ARE
CRIPPLED BY STUDENT DEBT AND
MOTHERS WHO CAN'T AFFORD THE
COST OF CHILDCARE, REQUIRED TO RETURN TO WORK.
[CHEERING] OTHERS SEE THE HARDSHIPS OF THE
UNFAIRNESS AND SAY THEY FEEL FOR
YOU. ONLY MY FATHER WILL SAY, I WILL FIGHT FOR YOU.
[CHEERING] THE HARD-WORKING MEN AND WOMEN
OF THIS COUNTRY IDENTIFY WITH MY
FATHER.
HE IS TOUGH AND HIS PERSEVERING.
HIS HONEST AND REAL. HE IS AN OPTIMIST AND HE IS A RELENTLESS BELIEVER IN AMERICA AND ALL OF HER POTENTIAL. HE LOVES HIS FAMILY AND HE LOVES
HIS COUNTRY WITH HIS HEART AND
HIS SOUL. POLITICIANS ASK TO BE JUDGED BY
THEIR PROMISES, NOT THE RESULTS, I ASK YOU TO JUDGE MY FATHER BY HIS RESULTS.
JUDGES BODIES BY THOSE HE HAS
INSTILLED IN HIS CHILDREN. JUDGES COMPETENCY BY THE POWERS
HE HAS BUILT. THE COMPANIES HE FOUNDED AND THE
TENS OF THOUSANDS OF JOBS HE HAS
CREATED. HE IS THE SINGLE MOST QUALIFIED
PERSON TO SERVE AS CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF AN TRILLION DOLLAR
ECONOMY.
-- $18 TRILLION ECONOMY. MY FATHER WILL CALL UPON THE
BEST AND BRIGHTEST PEOPLE FROM ALL SPHERES OF INDUSTRY AND BOTH
SIDES OF THE AISLE. A NEW SET OF THINKERS TO FACE
OUR COUNTRY'S EXISTING AND
FUTURE PROBLEMS WITH FRESH PERSPECTIVE AND BRAVE, NEW
SOLUTIONS. COME JANUARY 17, ALL THINGS WILL BE POSSIBLE AGAIN. WE CAN HOPE AND DREAM AND THINK
BIG AGAIN. NO ONE HAS MORE FAITH IN THE AMERICAN PEOPLE BEEN MY FATHER. HE WILL BE YOUR GREATEST,
TRUEST, MOST LOYAL CHAMPION.
[CHEERING] THIS IS THE FIGHTER, THE VIEWER
YOU HAVE CHOSEN AS YOUR NOMINEE IN WAYS NO ONE EXPECTED. THIS MOMENT IN THE LIFE OF OUR
COUNTRY HAS DEFINED THE MISSION
AND GIVEN IT TO EXTORT A MAN.
HE IS READY TO SEE IT ALL -- EXTRAORDINARY MAN. READY TO SEE IT ALL THE WAY
THROUGH. SPEAK EVERY MAN AND EVERY WOMAN
OF EVERY BACKGROUND IN EVERY
PART OF THIS COUNTRY. TO EARN YOUR TRUST AND YOUR
BOAT. THAT AND MUCH MORE FROM THE A
LONG TIME AGO, I HAVE LOVED AND RESPECTED HIM MY ENTIRE LIFE AND I COULD NOT BE MORE PROUD TONIGHT TO PRESENT TO YOU AND TO ALL OF AMERICA MY FATHER AND OUR NEXT PRESIDENT, DONALD J TRUMP.

<p class='short_transcript'> >> THANK YOU.
[CHEERING] THANK YOU MUCH. FRIENDS, DELEGATES AND FELLOW
AMERICANS: I HUMBLY AND
GRATEFULLY ACCEPT YOUR
NOMINATION FOR THE PRESIDENCY OF
THE<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> UNITED STATES.
[CHEERING] USA! USA!
>> USA! USA!
>> WHO WOULD HAVE BELIEVED THAT WHAT WE STARTED THIS JOURNEY ON
JUNE 16, LAST YEAR, WE AND I SAY WE BECAUSE WE ARE A TEAM.
[CHEERING] WOULD HAVE RECEIVED ALMOST 14
MILLION VOTES, THE MOST IN THE HISTORY OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. AND THAT THE REPUBLICAN PARTY WOULD GET 60% MORE VOTES THAN IT RECEIVED EIGHT YEARS AGO. WHO WOULD HAVE BELIEVED IT?
[CHEERING] THE DEMOCRATS ON THE OTHER HAND, RECEIVED 20% FEWER VOTES THAN
THEY GOT FOUR YEARS AGO, NOT SO
GOOD.
[CHEERING] TOGETHER, WE WILL LEAD OUR PARTY
BACK TO THE WHITE HOUSE, AND WE WILL LEAD OUR COUNTRY
BACK TO SAFETY, PROSPERITY, AND
PEACE.
[CHEERING] WE WILL BE A COUNTRY OF
GENEROSITY AND WARMTH. BUT WE WILL ALSO BE A COUNTRY OF
LAW AND ORDER.
[CHEERING] OUR CONVENTION OCCURS AT A
MOMENT OF CRISIS FOR OUR NATION.
THE ATTACKS ON OUR POLICE, AND THE TERRORISM IN OUR CITIES,
THREATEN OUR VERY WAY OF LIFE. ANY POLITICIAN WHO DOES NOT
GRASP THIS DANGER IS NOT FIT TO
LEAD OUR COUNTRY.
[CHEERING] AMERICANS WATCHING THIS ADDRESS TONIGHT HAVE SEEN THE RECENT
IMAGES OF VIOLENCE IN OUR STREETS AND THE CHAOS IN OUR COMMUNITIES. MANY HAVE WITNESSED THIS VIOLENCE PERSONALLY, SOME HAVE EVEN BEEN ITS VICTIMS. I HAVE A MESSAGE FOR ALL OF YOU: THE CRIME AND VIOLENCE THAT TODAY AFFLICTS OUR NATION WILL SOON, AND I MEAN VERY SOON COME
TO AN END.
[CHEERING] BEGINNING ON JANUARY 20TH 2017,
SAFETY WILL BE RESTORED.
[CHEERING] THE MOST BASIC DUTY OF
GOVERNMENT IS TO DEFEND THE
LIVES OF ITS CITIZENS. ANY GOVERNMENT THAT FAILS TO DO
SO IS A GOVERNMENT UNWORTHY TO LEAD.
IT IS FINALLY TIME FOR A
STRAIGHTFORWARD ASSESSMENT OF
THE STATE OF OUR NATION.
[CHEERING] I WILL PRESENT THE FACTS PLAINLY
AND HONESTLY. WE CANNOT AFFORD TO BE SO
POLITICALLY CORRECT ANYMORE.
[CHEERING] SO IF YOU WANT TO HEAR THE
CORPORATE SPIN, THE CAREFULLY-CRAFTED LIES, AND THE
MEDIA MYTHS, THE DEMOCRATS ARE
HOLDING THEIR CONVENTION NEXT WEEK.
GO THERE. BUT HERE, AT OUR CONVENTION, THERE WILL BE NO LIES. WE WILL HONOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WITH THE TRUTH, AND NOTHING ELSE.
[CHEERING]
>> USA. USA. USA.
>> THESE ARE THE FACTS: DECADES OF PROGRESS MADE IN BRINGING DOWN CRIME ARE NOW BEING REVERSED BY THIS ADMINISTRATION'S ROLLBACK OF
CRIMINAL ENFORCEMENT. HOMICIDES LAST YEAR INCREASED BY 17% IN AMERICA'S FIFTY LARGEST
CITIES. THAT'S THE LARGEST INCREASE IN
25 YEARS.
>> BOO! IN OUR NATION'S CAPITAL, KILLINGS HAVE RISEN BY 50%. THEY ARE UP NEARLY 60% IN NEARBY BALTIMORE.
IN THE PRESIDENT'S HOMETOWN OF
CHICAGO, MORE THAN 2,000 HAVE
BEEN THE VICTIMS OF SHOOTINGS
THIS YEAR ALONE. AND ALMOST 4000 HAVE BEEN KILLED
IN THE CHICAGO AREA
SINCE HE TOOK OFFICE.
>> BOO!
>> THE NUMBER OF POLICE OFFICERS KILLED IN THE LINE OF DUTY HAS
RISEN BY ALMOST 50% COMPARED TO THIS POINT LAST YEAR. NEARLY 180,000 ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS WITH CRIMINAL RECORDS, ORDERED DEPORTED FROM OUR COUNTRY, ARE TONIGHT ROAMING FREE TO THREATEN PEACEFUL CITIZENS. THE NUMBER OF NEW ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT FAMILIES WHO HAVE
CROSSED THE BORDER SO FAR THIS
YEAR ALREADY EXCEEDS THE ENTIRE TOTAL OF 2015.
THEY ARE BEING RELEASED BY THE TENS OF THOUSANDS INTO OUR
COMMUNITIES WITH NO REGARD FOR THE IMPACT ON PUBLIC SAFETY OR RESOURCES.
>> BUILD THE WALL!
>> ONE SUCH BORDER-CROSSER WAS
RELEASED AND MADE HIS WAY TO
NEBRASKA. THERE, HE ENDED THE LIFE OF AN
INNOCENT YOUNG GIRL NAMED SARAH
ROUTE.
-- ROOT. SHE WAS 21 YEARS OLD AND WAS KILLED THE DAY AFTER GRADUATING
FROM COLLEGE WITH A 4.0
GRADE POINT AVERAGE. THE ONE IN HER CLASS. HER KILLER WAS THEN RELEASED A
SECOND TIME, AND HE IS NOW A
FUGITIVE FROM THE LAW.
I'VE MET SARAH'S BEAUTIFUL
FAMILY.
BUT TO THIS ADMINISTRATION, THEIR AMAZING DAUGHTER WAS JUST
ONE MORE AMERICAN LIFE THAT WASN'T WORTH PROTECTING. NO MORE. ONE MORE CHILD TO SACRIFICE ON THE ALTAR OF OPEN BORDERS. WHAT ABOUT OUR ECONOMY? AGAIN, I WILL TELL YOU THE PLAIN FACTS THAT HAVE BEEN EDITED OUT OF YOUR NIGHTLY NEWS AND YOUR MORNING NEWSPAPER: NEARLY FOUR IN 10 AFRICAN-AMERICAN CHILDREN ARE LIVING IN POVERTY, WHILE 58% OF AFRICAN-AMERICAN YOUTH ARE NOW
NOT EMPLOYED. 2 MILLION MORE LATINOS ARE IN
POVERTY TODAY THAN WHEN THE
PRESIDENT TOOK HIS OATH OF
OFFICE EIGHT YEARS AGO. ANOTHER 14 MILLION PEOPLE HAVE
LEFT THE WORKFORCE ENTIRELY.
HOUSEHOLD INCOMES ARE DOWN MORE
THAN $4,000 SINCE THE YEAR 2000. THAT IS 16 YEARS AGO. OUR TRADE DEFICIT IN GOODS REACHED, THINK OF THIS, OUR TRADE DEFICIT IS IT HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS.
THINK OF THAT.
$800 BILLION LAST YEAR ALONE. WE WILL FIX THAT.
[CHEERING] THE BUDGET IS NO BETTER.
PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS DOUBLED OUR
-- ALMOST DOUBLED OUR NATIONAL DEBT TO MORE THAN $19 TRILLION, AND GROWING. YET, WHAT DO WE HAVE TO SHOW FOR IT?
OUR ROADS AND BRIDGES ARE FALLING APART, OUR AIRPORTS ARE
IN THIRD WORLD CONDITION, AND 43 MILLION AMERICANS ARE ON FOOD STAMPS.
NOW LET US CONSIDER THE STATE OF AFFAIRS ABROAD.
NOT ONLY HAVE OUR CITIZENS ENDURED DOMESTIC DISASTER, BUT THEY HAVE LIVED THROUGH ONE
INTERNATIONAL HUMILIATION AFTER
ANOTHER. ONE AFTER ANOTHER. WE ALL REMEMBER THE IMAGES OF
OUR SAILORS BEING FORCED TO
THEIR KNEES BY THEIR IRANIAN CAPTORS AT GUNPOINT.
>> BOO!
>> THIS WAS JUST PRIOR TO THE
SIGNING OF THE IRAN DEAL, WHICH
GAVE BACK TO IRAN $150 BILLION
AND GAVE US ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.
>> BOO!
>> IT WILL GO DOWN IN HISTORY AS
ONE OF THE WORST DEALS EVER
NEGOTIATED. ANOTHER HUMILIATION CAME WHEN
PRESIDENT OBAMA DREW A RED LINE IN SYRIA AND THE WHOLE WORLD KNEW IT MEANT ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. IN LIBYA, OUR CONSULATE, THE
SYMBOL OF AMERICAN PRESTIGE AROUND THE GLOBE WAS BROUGHT
DOWN IN FLAMES. AMERICA IS FAR LESS SAFE AND
THE WORLD IS FAR LESS STABLE
THAN WHEN OBAMA MADE THE
DECISION TO PUT HILLARY CLINTON
IN CHARGE OF AMERICA'S FOREIGN
POLICY.
>> BOO!
>>LOCK HER UP! LOCK HER UP! LOCK HER UP!
>> LED TO DEFEAT HER IN NOVEMBER.
[CHEERING] I AM CERTAIN IT IS A DECISION HE
TRULY REGRETS.
HER BAD INSTINCTS AND HER BAD JUDGMENT, SOMETHING POINTED OUT BY BERNIE SANDERS ARE WHAT CAUSED THE DISASTERS UNFOLDING
TODAY. LET'S REVIEW THE RECORD. IN 2009, PRE-HILLARY, ISIS WAS
NOT EVEN ON THE MAP. LIBYA WAS STABLE. EACH OF WAS PEACEFUL. IRAQ WAS SEEN A BIG PRODUCTION AND VIOLENCE.
IRAN WAS BEING CHOKED BY
SANCTIONS. SERIAL WAS SOMEWHAT UNDER
CONTROL. AFTER FOUR YEARS OF HILLARY
CLINTON, WHAT DO WE HAVE?
ISIS HAS SPREAD ACROSS THE REGION AND THE ENTIRE WORLD. LIBYA IS IN RUINS, AND OUR AMBASSADOR AND HIS STAFF WERE
LEFT HELPLESS TO DIE AT THE HANDS OF SAVAGE KILLERS. EGYPT WAS TURNED OVER TO THE RADICAL MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD,
FORCING THE MILITARY TO RETAKE CONTROL. IRAQ IS IN CHAOS. IRAN IS ON THE PATH TO NUCLEAR WEAPONS. SYRIA IS ENGULFED IN A CIVIL WAR AND A REFUGEE CRISIS THAT NOW THREATENS THE WEST. AFTER 15 YEARS OF WARS IN THE MIDDLE EAST, AFTER TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS SPENT AND THOUSANDS OF
LIVES LOST, THE SITUATION IS
WORSE THAN IT HAS EVER BEEN BEFORE. THIS IS THE LEGACY OF HILLARY CLINTON: DEATH, DESTRUCTION AND TERRORISM AND WEAKNESS.
>> BOO!
>> BUT HILLARY CLINTON'S LEGACY
DOES NOT HAVE TO BE AMERICA'S LEGACY.
THE PROBLEMS WE FACE NOW,
POVERTY AND VIOLENCE AT HOME, WAR AND DESTRUCTION ABROAD, WILL
LAST ONLY AS LONG AS WE CONTINUE
RELYING ON THE SAME POLITICIANS
WHO CREATED THEM.
A CHANGE IN LEADERSHIP IS REQUIRED TO PRODUCE A CHANGE IN OUTCOMES.
[CHEERING] TONIGHT, I WILL SHARE WITH YOU FOR ACTION FOR AMERICA.
THE MOST IMPORTANT DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN OUR PLAN AND THAT OF OUR
OPPONENTS, IS THAT OUR PLAN WILL PUT AMERICA FIRST.
[CHEERING] AMERICANISM, NOT GLOBALISM, WILL
BE OUR CREDO.
[CHEERING] AS LONG AS WE ARE LED BY POLITICIANS WHO WILL NOT PUT AMERICA FIRST, THEN WE CAN BE ASSURED THAT OTHER NATIONS WILL
NOT TREAT AMERICA WITH RESPECT.
THE RESPECT THAT WE DESERVE.
[CHEERING] THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WILL COME
ONCE AGAIN. FIRST[CHEERING] MY PLAN WILL BEGIN WITH SAFETY AT HOME WHICH MEANS SAFE NEIGHBORHOODS, SECURE BORDERS,
AND PROTECTION FROM TERRORISM. THERE CAN BE NO PROSPERITY WITHOUT LAW AND ORDER.
[CHEERING] ON THE ECONOMY, I WILL OUTLINE REFORMS TO ADD MILLIONS OF NEW JOBS AND TRILLIONS IN NEW WEALTH THAT CAN BE USED TO REBUILD AMERICA. A NUMBER OF THESE REFORMS THAT I WILL OUTLINE TONIGHT WILL BE OPPOSED BY SOME OF OUR NATION'S
MOST POWERFUL SPECIAL INTERESTS.
THAT IS BECAUSE THESE INTERESTS
HAVE RIGGED OUR POLITICAL AND
ECONOMIC SYSTEM FOR THEIR
EXCLUSIVE BENEFIT. BELIEVE ME. IT IS FURTHER BENEFIT.
-- FOUR THEIR BENEFIT. BIG BUSINESS, ELITE MEDIA AND
MAJOR DONORS ARE LINING UP
BEHIND THE CAMPAIGN OF MY
OPPONENT BECAUSE THEY KNOW SHE
WILL KEEP OUR RIGGED SYSTEM IN
PLACE. THEY ARE THROWING MONEY AT HER
BECAUSE THEY HAVE TOTAL CONTROL
OVER EVERY SINGLE THING SHE
DOES.
SHE IS THEIR PUPPET, AND THEY PULL THE STRINGS. THAT IS WHY HILLARY CLINTON'S
MESSAGE IS THAT THINGS WILL
NEVER CHANGE. NEVER EVER. MY MESSAGE IS THAT THINGS HAVE TO CHANGE AND THEY HAVE TO CHANGE RIGHT NOW.
[CHEERING] EVERY DAY I WAKE UP DETERMINED
TO DELIVER A BETTER LIFE FOR THE
PEOPLE ALL ACROSS THIS NATION THAT HAD BEEN IGNORED, NEGLECTED
AND ABANDONED.
, I HAVE VISITED THE LAID-OFF
FACTORY WORKERS, AND THE
COMMUNITIES CRUSHED BY OUR
HORRIBLE AND UNFAIR TRADE DEALS. THESE ARE THE FORGOTTEN MEN AND
WOMEN OF OUR COUNTRY, AND THEY
ARE FORGOTTEN, BUT THEY WILL NOT
BE FORGOTTEN LONG.
[CHEERING] THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO WORK HARD
BUT NO LONGER HAVE A VOICE.
I AM YOUR VOICE.
[CHEERING] I HAVE EMBRACED CRYING MOTHERS
WHO HAVE LOST THEIR CHILDREN
BECAUSE OUR POLITICIANS PUT
THEIR PERSONAL AGENDAS BEFORE
THE NATIONAL GOOD. I HAVE NO PATIENCE FOR
--
>> USA. USA. USA. USA.
>> HOW GREAT OUR OUR POLICE AND
HOW GREAT IS CLEVELAND?
[CHEERING] THANK YOU. I HAVE NO PATIENCE FOR
INJUSTICE. NO TOLERANCE FOR GOVERNMENT INCOMPETENCE OF WHICH THERE IS
SO MUCH NO SYMPATHY FOR LEADERS
, WHO FEEL THEIR CITIZENS.
WHEN INNOCENT PEOPLE SUFFER,
BECAUSE OUR POLITICAL SYSTEM
LACKS THE WILL, OR THE COURAGE,
OR THE BASIC DECENCY TO ENFORCE OUR LAWS, OR WORSE STILL, HAS
SOLD OUT TO SOME CORPORATE LOBBYIST FOR CASH I AM NOT ABLE
, TO LOOK THE OTHER WAY. AND I WON'T LOOK THE OTHER WAY.
[CHEERING] AND WHEN A SECRETARY OF STATE
ILLEGALLY STORES HER EMAILS ON A
PRIVATE SERVER, DELETES 33,000
OF THEM SO THE AUTHORITIES CAN'T
SEE HER CRIME, PUTS OUR COUNTRY
AT RISK, LIES ABOUT IT IN EVERY
DIFFERENT FORM AND FACES NO NO CONSEQUENCE I KNOW THAT
, CORRUPTION HAS REACHED A LEVEL LIKE NEVER EVER BEFORE IN OUR
COUNTRY.
[CHEERING] WHEN THE FBI DIRECTOR SAYS THAT THE SECRETARY OF STATE WAS
"EXTREMELY CARELESS" AND
"NEGLIGENT," IN HANDLING OUR CLASSIFIED SECRETS, I ALSO KNOW THAT THESE TERMS ARE MINOR COMPARED TO WHAT SHE ACTUALLY DID.
THEY WERE JUST USED TO SAVE HER FROM FACING JUSTICE FOR HER TERRIBLE, TERRIBLE CRIMES. IN FACT, HER SINGLE GREATEST
ACCOMPLISHMENT MAY BE COMMITTING
SUCH AN EGREGIOUS CRIME AND
GETTING AWAY WITH IT, ESPECIALLY
WHEN OTHERS WHO HAVE BEEN FAR LESS HAVE PAID SO DEARLY. WHEN THAT SAME SECRETARY OF
STATE RAKES IN MILLIONS OF
DOLLARS TRADING ACCESS AND
FAVORS TO SPECIAL INTERESTS AND
FOREIGN POWERS I KNOW THE TIME
FOR ACTION HAS COME.
[CHEERING] I HAVE JOINED THE POLITICAL
ARENA SO THAT THE POWERFUL CAN
NO LONGER BEAT UP ON PEOPLE THAT
CANNOT DEFEND THEMSELVES.
[CHEERING] NOBODY KNOWS THE SYSTEM BETTER
THAN ME, WHICH IS WHY I ALONE
CAN FIX IT.
[CHEERING] I HAVE SEEN FIRSTHAND HOW THE SYSTEM IS RIGGED AGAINST OUR CITIZENS, JUST LIKE IT WAS RIGGED AGAINST BERNIE SANDERS.
HE NEVER HAD A CHANCE. BUT HIS
 --
>> BOO!
>> BUT HIS SUPPORTERS WILL JOIN OUR MOVEMENT, BECAUSE WE WILL FIX HIS BIGGEST ISSUE. TRADE DEALS THAT STRIP OUR
COUNTRY OF JOBS AND THE
DISTRIBUTION OF WEALTH IN THE
COUNTRY. MILLIONS OF DEMOCRATS WILL JOIN
OUR MOVEMENT, BECAUSE WE ARE
GOING TO FIX THE SYSTEM SO IT
WORKS FAIRLY AND JUSTLY FOR EACH
AND EVERY AMERICAN.
[CHEERING] IN THIS CAUSE, I AM PROUD TO
HAVE AT MY SIDE THE NEXT VICE
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: GOVERNOR MIKE PENCE OF INDIANA.
[CHEERING] AND A GREAT GUIDE.
-- GUY. WE WILL BRING THE SAME ECONOMIC
SUCCESS TO AMERICA THAT MIKE BROUGHT INDIANA, WHICH IS
AMAZING.
[CHEERING] HE IS A MAN OF CHARACTER AND ACCOMPLISHMENT.
HE IS THE RIGHT MAN FOR THE JOB. THE FIRST TASK FOR OUR NEW ADMINISTRATION WILL BE TO LIBERATE OUR CITIZENS FROM THE
CRIME AND TERRORISM AND LAWLESSNESS THAT THREATENS THEIR
-- OUR COMMUNITIES.
AMERICA WAS SHOCKED TO ITS CORE WHEN OUR POLICE OFFICERS IN DALLAS WERE SO BRUTALLY EXECUTED
.
A MEDIATELY AFTER DALLAS, WE HAVE SEEN CONTINUED THREATS AND VIOLENCE AGAINST OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS.
LAW OFFICERS HAVE BEEN SHOT OR KILLED IN RECENT DAYS IN
GEORGIA, MISSOURI, WISCONSIN,
KANSAS, MICHIGAN AND TENNESSEE.

>> BOO!
>> ON SUNDAY, MORE POLICE WERE
GUNNED DOWN IN BATON ROUGE,
LOUISIANA. THREE WERE KILLED, AND FOUR WERE
-- THREE WERE VERY BADLY
INJURED. AN ATTACK ON LAW ENFORCEMENT IS
AN ATTACK ON ALL AMERICANS.
[CHEERING] I HAVE A MESSAGE TO EVERY LAST
PERSON THREATENING THE PEACE ON
OUR STREETS AND THE SAFETY OF
OUR POLICE: WHEN I TAKE THE OATH
OF OFFICE NEXT YEAR, I WILL
RESTORE LAW AND ORDER TO OUR COUNTRY.
[CHEERING] I WILL WORK WITH, AND APPOINT,
THE BEST PROSECUTORS AND LAW
ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS IN THE
COUNTRY TO GET THE JOB PROPERLY
DONE.
[CHEERING] IN THIS RACE FOR THE WHITE HOUSE, I AM THE LAW AND ORDER CANDIDATE.
[CHEERING] THE IRRESPONSIBLE RHETORIC OF OUR PRESIDENT, WHO HAS USED THE PULPIT OF THE PRESIDENCY TO DIVIDE US BY RACE AND COLOR, HAS
MADE AMERICA A MORE DANGEROUS ENVIRONMENT THAN FRANKLY, I HAVE
EVER SEEN AND ANYBODY IN THIS
ROOM HAS EVER WATCHED OR SEEING. THIS ADMINISTRATION HAS FAILED
AMERICA'S INNER CITIES. REMEMBER, IT HAS FAILED
AMERICA'S INNER CITIES. IT'S FAILED THEM ON EDUCATION. IT'S FAILED THEM ON JOBS. IT'S FAILED THEM ON CRIME. IT'S FAILED THEM IN EVERY WAY
AND ON EVERY SINGLE LEVEL. WHEN I AM PRESIDENT, I WILL WORK TO ENSURE THAT ALL OF OUR KIDS
ARE TREATED EQUALLY, AND
PROTECTED EQUALLY. EVERY ACTION I TAKE, I WILL ASK MYSELF: DOES THIS MAKE LIFE
BETTER FOR YOUNG AMERICANS IN
BALTIMORE, CHICAGO, DETROIT, AND FERGUSON WHO HAVE REALLY
COME IN EVERY WAY, HAVE THE SAME RIGHT TO LIVE OUT THEIR DREAMS
AS ANY OTHER CHILD IN AMERICA?
[CHEERING] TO MAKE LIFE SAFE IN AMERICA, WE
MUST ALSO ADDRESS THE GROWING THREATS FROM OUTSIDE THE
COUNTRY. WE ARE GOING TO DEFEAT THE
BARBARIANS OF ISIS.
AND WE ARE GOING TO DEFEAT THEM
BAD.
[CHEERING] ONCE AGAIN, FRANCE IS THE VICTIM
OF BRUTAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM. MEN, WOMEN AND CHILDREN VICIOUSLY MOWED DOWN. LIVES RUINED. FAMILIES RIPPED APART. A NATION IN MOURNING. THE DAMAGE AND DEVASTATION THAT CAN BE INFLICTED BY ISLAMIC RADICALS HAS BEEN PROVEN OVER AND OVER. AT THE WORLD TRADE CENTER, AT AN OFFICE PARTY IN SAN BERNARDINO, AT THE BOSTON MARATHON, AND A
MILITARY RECRUITING CENTER IN
CHATTANOOGA, TENNESSEE. AND MANY OTHER LOCATIONS. ONLY WEEKS AGO, IN ORLANDO,
FLORIDA, 49 WONDERFUL AMERICANS
WERE SAVAGELY MURDERED BY AN
ISLAMIC TERRORIST. THIS TIME, THE TERRORIST TARGETED LGBTQ COMMUNITY. NO GOOD. AND WE'RE GOING TO STOP IT.
[CHEERING] AS YOUR PRESIDENT, I WILL DO
EVERYTHING IN MY POWER TO
PROTECT OUR LGBTQ CITIZENS FROM
THE VIOLENCE AND OPPRESSION OF A HATEFUL FOREIGN IDEOLOGY.
[CHEERING] BELIEVE ME. AND I HAVE TO SAY AS A
REPUBLICAN, IT IS SO NICE TO
HEAR YOU CHEERING FOR WHAT I
JUST SAID. THANK YOU.
[CHEERING] TO PROTECT US FROM TERRORISM, WE
NEED TO FOCUS ON THREE THINGS. WE MUST HAVE THE BEST
, ABSOLUTELY THE BEST GATHERING OF INTELLIGENCE ANYWHERE IN THE
WORLD.
THE BEST.
[CHEERING] WE MUST ABANDON THE FAILED
POLICY OF NATION- BUILDING AND
REGIME CHANGE THAT HILLARY
CLINTON PUSHED IN IRAQ, LIBYA, IN EGYPT, AND SYRIA. INSTEAD, WE MUST WORK WITH ALL
OF OUR ALLIES WHO SHARE OUR GOAL
OF DESTROYING ISIS AND STAMPING OUT ISLAMIC TERRORISM AND DOING IT NOW, DOING IT QUICKLY. WE'RE GOING TO WIN.
WE'RE GOING TO WIN FAST.
[CHEERING] THIS INCLUDES WORKING WITH OUR GREATEST ALLY IN THE REGION, THE STATE OF ISRAEL.
[CHEERING] RECENTLY I HAVE SAID THAT NATO
WAS OBSOLETE. BECAUSE IT DID NOT PROPERLY COVER TERROR. AND ALSO THAT MANY OF THE MEMBER COUNTRIES WERE NOT PAYING THEIR FAIR SHARE.
>> BOO!
>> AS USUAL, THE UNITED STATES HAS BEEN PICKING UP THE COST. SHORTLY THEREAFTER, IT WAS ANNOUNCED THAT NATO WILL BE SETTING UP A NEW PROGRAM IN ORDER TO COMBAT TERRORISM. A TRUE STEP IN THE RIGHT
TRACTION.
-- DIRECTION.
[CHEERING] LASTLY, AND VERY IMPORTANTLY, WE
MUST IMMEDIATELY SUSPEND IMMIGRATION FROM ANY NATION THAT
HAS BEEN COMPROMISED BY
TERRORISM UNTIL SUCH TIME AS
PROVEN VETTING MECHANISMS HAVE
BEEN PUT IN PLACE.
WE DON'T WANT THEM IN OUR
COUNTRY.
[CHEERING] MY OPPONENT HAS CALLED FOR A RADICAL 550% INCREASE, THINK OF THIS, THIS IS NOT BELIEVABLE,
BUT THIS IS WHAT IS HAPPENING, A 550% INCREASE IN SYRIAN REFUGEES ON TOP OF EXISTING MASSIVE
REFUGEE FLOWS COMING INTO OUR COUNTRY ALREADY UNDER THE LEADERSHIP OF PRESIDENT OBAMA.
>> BOO!
>> SHE PROPOSES THIS DESPITE THE FACT THAT THERE'S NO WAY TO
SCREEN THESE REFUGEES IN ORDER
TO FIND OUT WHO THEY ARE OR
WHERE THEY COME FROM. I ONLY WANT TO ADMIT INDIVIDUALS
INTO OUR COUNTRY WHO WILL
SUPPORT OUR VALUES AND LOVE OUR
PEOPLE.
[CHEERING] ANYONE WHO ENDORSES VIOLENCE,
HATRED OR OPPRESSION IS NOT
WELCOME IN OUR COUNTRY AND NEVER
EVER WILL BE.
[CHEERING] DECADES OF RECORD IMMIGRATION
HAVE PRODUCED LOWER WAGES AND
HIGHER UNEMPLOYMENT FOR OUR
CITIZENS, ESPECIALLY FOR AFRICAN-AMERICAN AND LATINO
WORKERS.
WE ARE GOING TO HAVE AN IMMIGRATION SYSTEM THAT WORKS,
BUT ONE THAT WORKS FOR THE
AMERICAN PEOPLE.
[CHEERING] ON MONDAY, WE HEARD FROM THREE
PARENTS WHOSE CHILDREN WERE
KILLED BY ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS MARY ANN MENDOZA, SABINE DURDEN,
AND MY FRIEND JAMIEL SHAW. THEY ARE JUST THREE BRAVE REPRESENTATIVES OF MANY THOUSANDS WHO HAVE SUFFERED SO
GREATLY. OF ALL MY TRAVELS IN THIS COUNTRY, NOTHING HAS AFFECTED ME
MORE, NOTHING EVEN CLOSE THAN
THE TIME I HAVE SPENT WITH THE MOTHERS AND FATHERS WHO HAVE LOST THEIR CHILDREN TO VIOLENCE SPILLING ACROSS OUR BORDERS,
WHICH WE CAN SOLVE. WE HAVE TO SOLVE IT.
[CHEERING] THESE FAMILIES HAVE NO SPECIAL
INTERESTS TO REPRESENT THEM.
THERE ARE NO DEMONSTRATORS TO PROTECT THEM AND NONE TOO
PROTEST ON THEIR BEHALF.
MY OPPONENT WILL NEVER MEET WITH
THEM, OR SHARE IN THEIR PAIN. BELIEVE ME. INSTEAD, MY OPPONENT WANTS THINGS WERE CITIES.
>> BOO! BUT WHERE WAS SANCTUARY FOR KATE STEINLE? WHERE WAS SANCTUARY FOR THE
CHILDREN OF MARY ANN, SABINE AND JAMIEL?
>>IS SO SAD TO EVEN BE TALKING
ABOUT THIS.
WE CAN SOLVE IT SO QUICKLY. WHERE WAS SANCTUARY FOR ALL THE
OTHER AMERICANS WHO HAVE BEEN SO
BRUTALLY MURDERED, AND WHO HAVE
SUFFERED SO HORRIBLY?
THESE WOUNDED AMERICAN FAMILIES
HAVE BEEN ALONE. BUT THEY ARE NOT ALONE ANY
LONGER.
[CHEERING] TONIGHT, THIS CANDIDATE AND THIS
WHOLE NATION STAND IN THEIR
CORNER TO SUPPORT THEM, TO SEND
THEM OUR LOVE, AND TO PLEDGE IN
THEIR HONOR THAT WE WILL SAVE COUNTLESS MORE FAMILIES FROM SUFFERING THE SAME AWFUL DATE.
[CHEERING]
-- FATE.
[CHEERING] WE ARE GOING TO BUILD A GREAT BORDER WALL TO STOP ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION, TO STOP THE GANGS AND THE VIOLENCE, AND TO STOP THE DRUGS FROM POURING INTO OUR COMMUNITIES.
[CHEERING] I HAVE BEEN HONORED TO RECEIVE
THE ENDORSEMENT OF AMERICA'S
BORDER PATROL AGENTS, AND WILL
WORK DIRECTLY WITH THEM TO
PROTECT THE INTEGRITY OF OUR LAWFUL, LAWFUL, IMMIGRATION
SYSTEM. BY ENDING CATCH-AND-RELEASE ON
THE BORDER, WE WILL STOP THE
CYCLE OF HUMAN SMUGGLING AND
VIOLENCE. ILLEGAL BORDER CROSSINGS WILL GO DOWN. WE WILL STOP IT. IT WILL NOT BE HAPPENING VERY MUCH ANYMORE.
BELIEVE ME.
[CHEERING] PEACE WILL BE RESTORED BY
ENFORCING THE RULES FOR THE
MILLIONS WHO OVERSTAY THEIR
VISAS, OUR LAWS WILL FINALLY RECEIVE THE RESPECT THEY DESERVE.
[CHEERING] TONIGHT, I WANT EVERY AMERICAN WHOSE DEMANDS FOR IMMIGRATION SECURITY HAVE BEEN DENIED AND
EVERY POLITICIAN WHO HAS DENIED THEM TO LISTEN VERY CLOSELY TO THE WORDS I AM ABOUT TO SAY. ON ON JANUARY 20 OF 2017, THE DAY I
TAKE THE OATH OF OFFICE,
AMERICANS WILL FINALLY WAKE UP
IN A COUNTRY WHERE THE LAWS OF
THE UNITED STATES ARE ENFORCED.
[CHEERING] WE ARE GOING TO BE CONSIDERATE
AND COMPASSIONATE TO EVERYONE. BUT MY GREATEST COMPASSION WILL BE FOR OUR OWN STRUGGLING
CITIZENS.
[CHEERING]
>> USA. USA. USA.
>> USA. USA. USA. MY PLAN IS THE EXACT OPPOSITE OF
THE RADICAL AND DANGEROUS IMMIGRATION POLICY OF HILLARY
CLINTON. AMERICANS WANT RELIEF FROM
UNCONTROLLED IMMIGRATION. WHICH IS WHAT WE HAVE NOW. COMMUNITIES WANT RELIEF. YET HILLARY CLINTON IS PROPOSING MASS AMNESTY, MASS IMMIGRATION, AND MASS LAWLESSNESS.
>> BOO!
>> HER PLAN WILL OVERWHELM YOUR SCHOOLS AND HOSPITALS, FURTHER REDUCE YOUR JOBS AND WAGES, AND MAKE IT HARDER FOR RECENT IMMIGRANTS TO ESCAPE FROM THE TREMENDOUS CYCLE OF POVERTY
THEY ARE GOING THROUGH RIGHT NOW
AND MAKE IT ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE
FOR THEM TO JOIN THE MIDDLE
CLASS.
[CHEERING] I HAVE A DIFFERENT VISION FOR
OUR WORKERS. IT BEGINS WITH A NEW, FAIR TRADE POLICY THAT PROTECTS OUR JOBS
AND STANDS UP TO COUNTRIES THAT CHEAT.
OF WHICH THERE ARE MANY. IT'S BEEN A SIGNATURE MESSAGE OF
MY CAMPAIGN FROM DAY ONE, AND IT
WILL BE A SIGNATURE FEATURE OF
MY PRESIDENCY FROM THE MOMENT I
TAKE THE OATH OF OFFICE.
[CHEERING] I HAVE MADE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS
IN BUSINESS MAKING DEALS.
NOW I'M GOING TO MAKE OUR COUNTRY RICH AGAIN. USING THE GREATEST BUSINESS PEOPLE OF THE WORLD, I'M GOING TO TURN OUR BAD TRADE AGREEMENTS INTO GREAT TRADE AGREEMENTS. AMERICA HAS LOST NEARLY-ONE THIRD OF ITS MANUFACTURING JOBS
SINCE 1997, FOLLOWING THE
ENACTMENT OF DISASTROUS TRADE
DEALS SUPPORTED BY BILL AND HILLARY CLINTON. REMEMBER, IT WAS BILL CLINTON WHO SIGNED NAFTA, ONE OF THE
WORST ECONOMIC DEALS EVER MADE
BY OUR COUNTRY. OR FRANKLY, ANY OTHER COUNTRY. NEVER EVER AGAIN.
[CHEERING] I AM GOING TO BRING OUR JOBS BACK OUR JOBS TO OHIO AND
PENNSYLVANIA AND NEW YORK AND
MICHIGAN AND ALL OF AMERICA AND I AM NOT GOING TO LET COMPANIES
MOVE TO OTHER COUNTRIES, FIRING
THEIR EMPLOYEES ALONG THE WAY,
WITHOUT CONSEQUENCES.
NOT GOING TO HAPPEN ANYMORE.
[CHEERING] MY OPPONENT, ON THE OTHER HAND,
HAS SUPPORTED VIRTUALLY EVERY
TRADE AGREEMENT THAT HAS BEEN
DESTROYING OUR MIDDLE CLASS. SHE
SUPPORTED NAFTA, AND SHE
SUPPORTED CHINA'S ENTRANCE INTO
THE WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION. ANOTHER ONE OF HER HUSBAND'S COLOSSAL MISTAKES AND DISASTERS. SHE SUPPORTED THE JOB KILLING
TRADE DEAL WITH SOUTH KOREA. SHE SHE SUPPORTED THE TRANSPACIFIC PARTNERSHIP WHICH WILL NOT ONLY
DESTROY OUR MANUFACTURING BUT IT
, WILL MAKE AMERICA SUBJECT
TO THE RULINGS OF FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS.
AND IT IS NOT GOING TO HAPPEN.
[CHEERING] I PLEDGE TO NEVER SIGN ANY TRADE
AGREEMENT THAT HURTS OUR
WORKERS, OR THAT DIMINISHES OUR
FREEDOM AND INDEPENDENCE.
WE WILL NEVER EVER SIGNED BAD TRADE DEALS. AMERICA FIRST AGAIN. AMERICAN FIRST. INSTEAD, I WILL MAKE INDIVIDUAL DEALS WITH INDIVIDUAL COUNTRIES. NO LONGER WILL WE ENTER INTO THESE MASSIVE TRANSACTIONS WITH MANY COUNTRIES THAT ARE
THOUSANDS OF PAGES LONG AND WHICH NO ONE FROM OUR COUNTRY EVEN READS OR UNDERSTANDS. WE ARE GOING TO ENFORCE ALL TRADE VIOLATIONS AGAINST ANY COUNTRY THAT CHEATS.
[CHEERING] THIS INCLUDES STOPPING CHINA'S OUTRAGEOUS THEFT OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, ALONG WITH THEIR ILLEGAL PRODUCT DUMPING, AND THEIR DEVASTATING CURRENCY MANIPULATION. THEY ARE THE GREATEST THAT EVER
CAME ABOUT, THEY ARE THE GREATEST CURRENTLY MANIPULATORS
EVER.
>> BOO! OUR HORRIBLE TRADE AGREEMENTS
WITH CHINA AND MANY OTHERS, WILL
BE TOTALLY RENEGOTIATED. THAT THAT INCLUDES RENEGOTIATING
NAFTA NAFTA TO GET A MUCH BETTER DEAL FOR AMERICA AND WILL WALK AWAY IF WE DON'T GET THAT KIND
OF A DEAL.
[CHEERING] OUR COUNTRY IS GOING TO START BUILDING AND MAKING THINGS AGAIN.
[CHEERING] NEXT COMES THE REFORM OF OUR TAX
LAWS, REGULATIONS AND ENERGY RULES.
WHILE HILLARY CLINTON PLANS A MASSIVE, AND I MEAN MASSIVE TAX INCREASE, I HAVE PROPOSED THE LARGEST TAX REDUCTION OF ANY CANDIDATE WHO HAS RUN FOR PRESIDENT THIS YEAR, DEMOCRAT OR REPUBLICAN.
[CHEERING] MIDDLE-INCOME AMERICANS WILL EXPERIENCE
PROFOUND RELIEF, AND TAXES WILL
BE GREATLY SIMPLIFIED FOR EVERYONE. I MEAN EVERYONE.
[CHEERING] AMERICA IS ONE OF THE
HIGHEST-TAXED NATIONS IN THE
WORLD. REDUCING TAXES WILL CAUSE NEW
COMPANIES AND NEW JOBS TO COME ROARING BACK INTO OUR COUNTRY. BELIEVE ME.
IT WILL HAPPEN AND IT WILL
HAPPEN FAST.
[CHEERING] THEN WE ARE GOING TO DEAL WITH
THE ISSUE OF REGULATION, ONE OF
THE GREATEST JOB KILLERS OF THEM
ALL. EXCESSIVE REGULATION IS COSTING OUR COUNTRY AS MUCH AS $2 TRILLION A YEAR, AND WE WILL END AND IT VERY QUICKLY.
[CHEERING] WE ARE GOING TO LIFT THE
RESTRICTIONS ON THE
PRODUCTION OF AMERICAN ENERGY.
[CHEERING] THIS WILL PRODUCE MORE THAN $20 TRILLION IN JOB- CREATING ECONOMIC ACTIVITY OVER THE NEXT
FOUR DECADES. MY OPPONENT, ON THE OTHER HAND,
WANTS TO PUT THE GREAT MINERS
AND STEEL WORKERS OF OUR COUNTRY
OUT OF WORK AND OUT OF BUSINESS. THAT WILL NEVER HAPPEN WITH DONALD J TRUMP AS PRESIDENT. OUR STEEL WORKERS AND OUR
STEELWORKERS AND ARE MINERS ARE
GOING BACK TO WORK AGAIN.
[CHEERING] WITH THESE NEW ECONOMIC
POLICIES, TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS
WILL START FLOWING INTO OUR
COUNTRY. THIS NEW WEALTH WILL IMPROVE THE
QUALITY OF LIFE FOR ALL
AMERICANS. WE WILL BUILD THE ROADS, HIGHWAYS, BRIDGES, TUNNELS,
AIRPORTS, AND THE RAILWAYS OF
OUR.
-- TOMORROW. THIS, IN TURN, WILL CREATE MILLIONS OF MORE JOBS. WE WILL RESCUE KIDS FROM FAILING SCHOOLS BY HELPING THEIR PARENTS SEND THEM TO A SAFE SCHOOL OF THEIR CHOICE.
[CHEERING] MY OPPONENT WOULD RATHER PROTECT EDUCATION BUREAUCRATS THAN SERVE
AMERICAN CHILDREN. THAT IS WHAT SHE IS DOING AND
THAT IS WHAT SHE HAS DONE. WE WILL REPEAL AND REPLACE DISASTROUS OBAMACARE.
[CHEERING] YOU WILL BE ABLE TO CHOOSE YOUR
OWN DOCTOR AGAIN.
[CHEERING] AND WE WILL FIX TSA AT THE
AIRPORTS, WHICH IS A TOTAL
DISASTER.
[CHEERING] THANK YOU. WE ARE GOING TO WORK WITH ALL OF
OUR STUDENTS WHO ARE DROWNING IN DEBT TO TAKE THE PRESSURE OFF THESE YOUNG PEOPLE JUST STARTING OUT IN THEIR ADULT LIVES.
[CHEERING] TREMENDOUS PROBLEMS. WE WILL COMPLETELY REBUILD OUR DEPLETED MILITARY.
[CHEERING] AND THE COUNTRIES THAT WE PROTECTING AT A MASSIVE COST TO US WILL BE ASKED TO PAY THEIR
FAIR SHARE.
[CHEERING] WE WILL TAKE CARE OF OUR GREAT
VETERANS LIKE THEY HAVE NEVER
BEEN TAKEN CARE OF BEFORE.
[CHEERING] MY JUST-RELEASED 10 POINT PLAN
HAS RELEASED -- RECEIVED
TREMENDOUS BETTER SUPPORT.
WE WILL GUARANTEE THOSE WHO
SERVE THIS COUNTRY WILL BE ABLE TO VISIT THE DOCTOR OR HOSPITAL
OF THEIR CHOICE WITHOUT WAITING FIVE DAYS IN A LINE AND DYING.
[CHEERING] MY OPPONENT DISMISSED THE VA
SCANDAL, ONE MORE SIGN OF HOW
OUT OF TOUCH SHE REALLY IS, WE ARE GOING TO ASK EVERY DEPARTMENT HEAD AND GOVERNMENT TO PROVIDE A LIST OF WASTEFUL SPENDING PROJECTS THAT WE CAN
ELIMINATE IN MY FIRST 100 DAYS.

[CHEERING] THE POLITICIANS HAVE TALKED
ABOUT THIS FOR YEARS, BUT I'M
GOING TO DO IT.
[CHEERING]
>> YES YOU WILL! YES YOU WILL! YES YOU WILL!
>> WE ARE ALSO GOING TO APPOINT JUSTICES TO THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT WHO WILL UPHOLD OUR LAWS AND OUR CONSTITUTION.
[CHEERING] THE REPLACEMENT OF OUR BELOVED
JUSTICE SCALIA WILL BE A PERSON OF SIMILAR VIEWS, PRINCIPLES AND
JUDICIAL PHILOSOPHIES. VERY IMPORTANT.
[CHEERING] THIS WILL BE ONE OF THE MOST
IMPORTANT ISSUES DECIDED BY THIS
ELECTION. MY OPPONENT WANTS TO ESSENTIALLY ABOLISH THE SECOND AMENDMENT.
>> BOO!
>> I, ON THE OTHER HAND,
RECEIVED THE EARLY AND STRONG
ENDORSEMENT OF THE NATIONAL
RIFLE ASSOCIATION.
[CHEERING] AND WILL PROTECT THE RIGHT OF
ALL AMERICANS TO KEEP THEIR
FAMILIES SAFE.
[CHEERING] AT THIS MOMENT, I WOULD LIKE TO
THANK THE EVANGELICAL COMMUNITY
BECAUSE, I WILL TELL YOU WHAT,
THE SUPPORT THEY HAVE GIVEN ME,
AND I'M NOT SURE I TOTALLY DESERVE IT, HAS BEEN SO AMAZING. AND HAS HAD SUCH A BIG AND -- HAS BEEN SUCH A BIG REASON I'M
HERE TONIGHT.
[CHEERING] SARTRE. THEY HAVE MUCH TO CONTRIBUTE TO
OUR POLICIES. YET OUR LAWS PREVENT YOU FROM
SPEAKING YOUR MIND FROM YOUR OWN
PULPITS.
AN AMENDMENT, PUSHED BY LYNDON JOHNSON, MANY YEARS AGO,
THREATENS RELIGIOUS INSTITUTIONS
WITH A LOSS OF THEIR TAX-EXEMPT
STATUS IF THEY OPENLY ADVOCATE
THEIR POLITICAL VIEWS.
THEIR VOICE HAS BEEN TAKEN AWAY. I WILL WORK HARD TO REPEAL THAT LANGUAGE AND TO PROTECT FREE SPEECH FOR ALL AMERICANS.
[CHEERING] WE CAN ACCOMPLISH THESE GREAT
THINGS AND SO MUCH MORE.
ALL WE NEED TO DO IS START BELIEVING IN OURSELVES AND IN
OUR COUNTRY AGAIN. START BELIEVING.
[CHEERING] IT IS TIME TO SHOW THE WHOLE WORLD THAT AMERICA IS BACK, BIGGER AND BETTER AND STRONGER THAN EVER BEFORE.
[CHEERING] IN THIS JOURNEY, I'M SO LUCKY TO HAVE AT MY SIDE MY WIFE MELANIA AND MY WONDERFUL CHILDREN DON, IVANKA, ERIC, TIFFANY, AND BARRON: YOU WILL ALWAYS BE MY GREATEST SOURCE OF PRIDE AND JOY.
AND BY THE WAY, MELANIA AND IVANKA,  DID THEY DO A JOB?
[CHEERING] MY DAD, FRED TRUMP, WAS THE
SMARTEST AND HARDEST WORKING MAN
I EVER KNEW. I WONDER SOMETIMES
WHAT HE'D SAY IF HE WERE HERE TO
SEE THIS TONIGHT. IT'S BECAUSE OF HIM THAT I
LEARNED, FROM MY YOUNGEST AGE,
TO RESPECT THE DIGNITY OF WORK
AND THE DIGNITY OF WORKING
PEOPLE.
[CHEERING] HE WAS A
GUY MOST COMFORTABLE IN THE
COMPANY OF BRICKLAYERS, CARPENTERS, AND ELECTRICIANS AND
I HAVE A LOT OF THAT IN ME ALSO. I LOVE THOSE PEOPLE.
[CHEERING] THEN THERE'S MY MOTHER, MARY. SHE WAS STRONG, BUT ALSO WARM AND FAIR-MINDED.
SHE WAS A TRULY GREAT MOTHER. SHE WAS ALSO ONE OF THE MOST
HONEST AND CHARITABLE PEOPLE I HAVE EVER KNOWN, AND A GREAT
, GREAT JUDGE OF CHARACTER. SHE COULD PICK THEM OUT FROM
ANYWHERE.
[CHEERING] TO MY SISTERS, MARY ANNE AND ELIZABETH, MY BROTHER ROBERT AND
MY LATE BROTHER FRED, I WILL
ALWAYS GIVE YOU MY LOVE.
YOU ARE MOST SPECIAL TO
ME.
[CHEERING] I HAVE LOVED MY LIFE IN
BUSINESS. BUT NOW, MY SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE
MISSION IS TO GO TO WORK FOR OUR COUNTRY, TO GO TO WORK FOR YOU. IT IS TIME TO DELIVER A VICTORY FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. WE DON'T WIN ANYMORE, BUT WE ARE GOING TO START WINNING AGAIN.
[CHEERING] BUT TO DO THAT, WE MUST BREAK
FREE FROM THE PETTY POLITICS OF
THE PAST. AMERICA IS A NATION OF BELIEVERS, DREAMERS, AND STRIVERS THAT IS BEING LED
BY A GROUP OF CENSORS, CRITICS, AND CYNICS. REMEMBER: ALL OF THE PEOPLE TELLING YOU YOU CAN'T HAVE THE COUNTRY YOU WANT, ARE THE SAME PEOPLE, THAT WOULD NOT STAND, I
MEAN THEY SAID TRUMP DOES NOT
HAVE A CHANCE OF BEING HERE
TONIGHT, NOT A CHANCE, THE SAME PEOPLE. WE LOVE DEFEATING THOSE PEOPLE, DON'T WE?
[CHEERING] LOVE IT. NO LONGER CAN WE RELY ON THOSE
SAME PEOPLE. IN THE MEDIA AND POLITICS WHO
, WILL SAY ANYTHING TO KEEP A RIGGED SYSTEM IN PLACE. INSTEAD, WE MUST CHOOSE TO
BELIEVE IN AMERICA.
HISTORY IS WATCHING US NOW. IT'S WE DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME. WE DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME. IT'S WAITING TO SEE IF WE WILL
RISE TO THE OCCASION, AND IF WE
WILL SHOW THE WHOLE WORLD THAT
AMERICA IS STILL FREE AND
INDEPENDENT AND STRONG. MY

[CHEERING] I AM ASKING FOR YOUR SUPPORT TONIGHT SO THAT I CAN BE YEAR
CHAMPION IN THE WHITE HOUSE. AND I WILL BE A CHAMPION.
-- YOUR CHAMPION.
[CHEERING] MY OPPONENT ASKS HER SUPPORTERS TO RECITE A THREE-WORD LOYALTY PLEDGE.
IT READS: "I'M WITH HER". I I CHOOSE TO RECITE A DIFFERENT PLEDGE. MY PLEDGE READS: "I'M WITH YOU
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE."
[CHEERING] I AM YOUR VOICE.
[CHEERING] SO TO EVERY PARENT WHO DREAMS
FOR THEIR CHILD, AND EVERY CHILD
WHO DREAMS FOR THEIR FUTURE, I
SAY THESE WORDS TO YOU TONIGHT:
I'M WITH YOU, AND I WILL FIGHT
FOR YOU, AND I WILL WIN FOR YOU.
[CHEERING] TO ALL AMERICANS TONIGHT, IN ALL
OUR CITIES AND TOWNS, I MAKE
THIS PROMISE: WE WILL MAKE
AMERICA STRONG AGAIN.
[CHEERING] WE WILL MAKE AMERICA PROUD AGAIN.
[CHEERING] WE WILL MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN.

[CHEERING] AND WE WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! GOD BLESS YOU AND GOOD NIGHT!
[CHEERING] I LOVE YOU!
[CHEERING]
