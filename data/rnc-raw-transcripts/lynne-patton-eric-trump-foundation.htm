<strong>Lynne Patton</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> HELLO, AMERICA.
[CHEERING] I TOLD HIM THEY WOULD BE TOUGH
ACT TO FOLLOW, BUT YOU KNOW
WHAT, I WILL GIVE IT A SHOT. HELLO, AMERICA!
[CHEERING] I'M HONORED<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> TO BE HERE TONIGHT ON BEHALF OF MY BOSS, DONALD J
TRUMP. AS SOMEONE WHO HAS TO WITH THE
FAMILY EACH AND EVERY DAY, FOR THE PAST SEVEN YEARS, I KNOW MR.
COME.
I KNOW HIS HEART AND END OF HIS PASSION FOR THIS COUNTRY TO BE
TRUE. TONIGHT, AS WE STAND IN THE SHADOWS OF ONE OF THE DARKEST
MOMENTS OF AMERICAN HISTORY, I
KNOW NOW MORE THAN EVER THAT DONALD TRUMP IS THE LAW AND ORDER LEADER WE NEED TO HEAL A
WOUNDED AND DIVIDED NATION.
[CHEERING] WE ALL WATCHED HORRIFIED AND HELPLESS AS A RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORIST TARGETED MEMBERS OF
THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY IN ORLANDO. WE HAVE SEEN DISCOURSE IN OUR URBAN COMMUNITIES SPARKED BY THE
SENSELESS DEATHS OF YOUNG BLACK MEN IN BATON ROUGE, MINNESOTA,
AND FAR TOO MANY PLACES AROUND
THIS COUNTRY. WE WATCHED IN HORROR AS OUR NATION'S FINEST WERE GUNNED DOWN IN DALLAS IN BATON ROUGE AS THEY
SOUGHT TO PROTECT THE VERY
PEOPLE PROTESTING THEM. IN ORDER TO HEAL AS A NATION, WE MUST STOP VIEWING THESE INCIDENTS AS ATTACKS ON THE
LGBTQ COMMUNITY OR ATTACKS ON
THE BLACK COMMUNITY OR EVEN
ATTACKS ON LAW ENFORCEMENT, THEY
ARE ATTACKS ON AMERICA, ATTACKS ON OUR VALUES, ATTACKS ON THE VERY FOUNDATION OF CIVIL
SOCIETY.
[CHEERING] SADLY THOUGH, THERE IS NOT ONE
PERSON IN THIS ROOM WHO CAN DENY THAT HISTORICALLY BLACK LIES HAVE MATTERED LESS. MY LIFE MATTERED LESS. WHETHER WE LIKE IT OR NOT, THERE ARE PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO STILL BELIEVE THIS TO BE TRUE. BUT TONIGHT, AS A MINORITY, I PERSONALLY PLEDGE TO YOU THAT DONALD TRUMP KNOWS THAT YOUR
LIFE MATTERS, HE KNOWS THAT MY
LIFE MATTERS, HE KNOWS THAT THE LGBTQ LIVES MATTER AND HE KNOWS THAT VETERANS LIVES MATTER AND
HE KNOWS THAT BLUE LIVES MATTER.
[CHEERING] THIS COUNTRY IS SADLY MORE
DIVIDED NOW THAN IT WAS EIGHT YEARS AGO. TONIGHT, DON'T HOPE FOR CHANGE,
BE THE CHANGE. BOTH NOT FOR THE CANDIDATE TO
ASK YOU TO STAND WITH HER, BUT
INSTEAD ASKED FOR THE CANDIDATE
WHO STANDS IN SOLIDARITY WITH
YOU.
[CHEERING]


>> THE BIBLE TELLS US YOU CAN
JUDGE A TREE BY THE FRUITED
BEARS. YOU CAN EMBRACE DONALD TRUMP
BECAUSE HE HAS RAISED THE BEST YOUNG ADULTS I HAVE EVER HAD THE PRIVILEGE TO KNOW AND THE HONOR TO CALL FRIENDS. THEY WERE RAISED TO BE RESPECTABLE -- RESPECTFUL OF ALL
AGES, RACES, AND RELIGION. I LOVE THEM LIKE THE SIBLINGS I
NEVER HAD. YOU ARE COMPASSIONATE,
CHARITABLE, YOU ARE MY HEROES. I BELIEVE IN THE OPPORTUNITY OF
AMERICA BECAUSE I HAVE SEEN IT
FIRSTHAND. MY FATHER WAS BORN IN
BIRMINGHAM, ALABAMA, AND ROSE TO
BECOME ONE OF THE MOST RESPECTED
DOCTORS AT YALE UNIVERSITY. I AM PROUD OF HIM, I AM PROUD OF
MY AFRICAN-AMERICAN HERITAGE,
AND I AM PROUD TO STAND BEFORE
YOU TONIGHT TO SUPPORT DONALD TRUMP, NOT JUST IN SPITE OF THE COLOR OF MY SKIN, BUT IN FACT
BECAUSE OF THE COLOR OF MY SKIN.
[APPLAUSE] MS. PATTON: GOD BLESS THIS
COUNTRY, GOD BLESS THIS FAMILY,
AND GOD BLESS DONALD J. TRUMP.

<strong>Marco Rubio</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> HILLARY CLINTON SPENT HER LIFETIME INSIDE A CORRUPT
POLITICAL SYSTEM THAT PUT HER INTEREST ABOVE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. SHE PLANTED THE SEEDS FOR THE<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> DISASTER OF OBAMACARE, AND WAS
FOR CRONYISM, WALL STREET BAILOUTS, MIDDLE-CLASS TAX HIKES, AND UNCONTROLLABLE GOVERNMENT SPENDING. SHE WAS A KEY FIGURE IN PRESIDENT OBAMA'S HORRIBLE FOREIGN POLICY RECORD,
DIMINISHING OUR ROLE IN THE
WORLD.
SHE TURNED HER BACK ON THE FALLEN HEROES IN BENGHAZI,
CARELESSLY JEOPARDIZED OUR
NATIONAL SECURITY, AND LIGHT
ABOUT IT TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.
HILLARY CLINTON DOES NOT HAVE
THE HONESTY, COURAGE, OR INDEPENDENCE TO BE THE PRESIDENT WE NEED THE NEXT FOUR YEARS
AFTER THE PRESIDENT WE HAD FOR
THE PAST EIGHT. UNLIKE HILLARY CLINTON, DONALD TRUMP IS COMMITTED TO CUT TAXES AND GET OUR NATIONAL DEBT UNDER CONTROL. UNLIKE OBAMA AND CLINTON, TRUMP TAKES SERIOUSLY THE THREAT FROM
ISLAMIC RADICALS AND WAS TO
REBUILD OUR MILITARY. AND TRUMP WANTS TO COMMIT PROPER
JUDGES WHO RESPECT THE ROLE OF
THE JUDICIARY. THE TIME FOR FIGHTING EACH OTHER
IS OVER, IT IS TIME TO COME TOGETHER AND FIGHT FOR A NEW
DIRECTION FOR AMERICA. IT IS TIME TO WIN IN NOVEMBER.
