<p class='short_transcript'> >> SEPTEMBER 11, 2012, WE GOT A CALL THAT YOU AS COMPLEX HAD
BEEN OVERRUN.
WE MEEKLY GOT READY TO GO. GOT THE VEHICLES READY. AND WE GOT PULLED AWAY BY<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> THE CHIEF AND WE GOT TOLD TO STAND
DOWN. NEXT THING WE KNOW, WE HEAR THE
STATE DEPARTMENT ON THE RADIO
SAYING IF YOU GUYS DON'T GET
HERE, WE WILL ALL DIE.
STANDDOWN ORDER BE DAMPED, -- DA MNED, WE TOOK OFF AND LEFT.
WE WERE NOT WAITING ANYMORE.
[CHEERING] AS THEY MOVED ON TO THE
CONSULATE, THE FIRST THING YOU SEE IS THE MAIN VILLAGE ENGULFED
IN FIRE AND SMOKE. JUST POURING OUT, MOVED UP TO
THE FRONT STEP OF THE CONSULATE,
ALL TO MY RIGHT, PULLING A BODY
OUT OF THE WINDOW, A LIVE BODY
AND I'D LOVE BEING A SMITH.
HE WAS DEAD OF SMOKE INHALATION. WE CONTINUE TO MOVE, WE WENT IN,
THE HEAT OF THE FIRE, BLASTING
IN OUR FACE, THE SMOKE,
OBLITERATED OUR SITE.
WE TRY TO GET ON OUR BELLIES AND
CNN AND THE SMOKE -- AND SEE UNDERNEATH THE SMOKE. WE CAME TO THE BACK GATE, AS IT MOVED UNDER THE CONSULATE
GROUNDS, STARTED SEARCHING, AFTER TWO MINUTES, THE STATE DEPARTMENT GUYS GOT UPDATE
CLASSIFIED INFORMATION, GET THEM
READY TO GO IN THE ARMORED VEHICLES AND ALL OF A SUDDEN, WE
HAD A GOOD ENCOUNTER ASSAULT.
AT THAT TIME, THE STATE
DEPARTMENT SECURITY AGENTS JUMPING OUT AND HELPING US DEFEND THE U.S. CONSULATE.
THEY TOOK OFF.
WITH LESS -- WHICH LEFT THE SIX
OF US TO DEFEND THE CONSULATE.
I GOT OUT, WENT UP ON THE ROOF
OF THE VILLA, MADE MY WAY UP TO THE BACK GATE, THE GUY WE INITIATED WAS WITHIN OUR BJ. ON HIS THIRD SHOT, -- R B J, ON
HIS THIRD SHOT I LET LOOSE ON A
10 ROUND VALLEY AND HE DROPPED.
[CHEERING] FOR ABOUT FIVE MINUTES, THEN WE GOT WORD, THEY WERE GATHERING ABOUT ANOTHER 100 TERRORISTS.
HILLARY WAS WATCHING. IT CAME TO A POINT WHERE WE HAD
TO MAKE A DECISION. AT THAT TIME WE DO NOT KNOW -- DID NOT KNOW THE US AMBASSADOR
WAS EVEN THERE OR IF HE HAD BEEN
KIDNAPPED. IF HE WAS DEAD. WE HAD A RESPONSIBILITY OF 30
OTHER PERSONNEL. WE HAD TO MAKE IT TOUGH
DECISION. WE HEADED BACK TO THE ANNEX
ABOUT THE AMBASSADOR. AS THE TEAM ARRIVED BACK AT THE ANNEX, WE TOOK OF OUR FIGHTING POSITIONS BECAUSE WE KNEW THEY WERE GOING TO BE FOLLOWING US FROM THE CONSULATE IN COMING TO OUR PLACE THE WE WERE READY FOR
THEM. WE STARTED SEEING MOVEMENT ON
THE SIDE OF THE COMPOUND. ALL OF A SUDDEN, SOMETHING CAME
POINT OVER THE WALL. LANDED BETWEEN US AND EXPLETIVE. THAT IS WHEN THEY OPENED UP ON
US AND WE UNLEASHED HELL ON
THEM.
[CHEERING] THE FIRST WAVE HAD ABOUT 20
TERRORISTS IN IT. THEY WENT AWAY WITH A WHOLE A
LESS.
-- WHOLE LOT LESS [CHEERING]

AMBASSADOR, STILL MISSING,
MOVEMENT STARTING TO COME UP
AGAIN ON THE EAST SIDE AND I GET
ON THE<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> RADIO AND SAY, ARE THEY
GOING TO SECURE THE OUTER
PRINTER. LOOKING AT 1:30, THREE HALF
HOURS.
WE GET THE ANSWER, I DON'T KNOW. GOOD INTEL. AT THAT POINT, A VEHICLE CAME OUT OF THE DARKNESS.
OF THE VEHICLE -- THE GUY CAME
OUT OF THE VEHICLE. PICKED HIM OUT, THROUGH ROUNDS INTO HIM AND DROPPED LIKE A BAG OF A SECOND POTATOES.
-- SECOND POTATOES.
[CHEERING] TAKE THAT GUY OUT AND ANOTHER
GUY WOULD POP UP. IT WAS LIKE THAT ARCADE GAME, LACRIMAL -- WHACK A MOLE. STICK HIS HEAD OUT, YOU SHOULD HIM.
-- SHOOT HIM.
[CHEERING] A LITTLE BIT OUT OF THAT, -- AFTER THAT, WE GOT A CALL THAT THE AMBASSADOR WAS LOCATED AT
THE HOSPITAL. THERE WAS NO WAY ACROSS TO DETERMINE IF THIS WAS A -- ALIVE
OR DEAD. WE DID NOT KNOW IF IT COULD HAVE
BEEN A TRICK FROST TO SPREAD OUR DEFENSE AND SCREW EVERYBODY ELSE
OVER. WE HAD IT STAY PUT. AT THIS TIME I MOVED FROM WHERE WAS THAT. I WAS UP THERE WITH TYRONE AND DURING THE DOWNTIME, WE STARTED
TALKING ABOUT EVENTS THAT NIGHT. HE TOLD ME EARLIER ABOUT WHEN SIG SAVED HIS LIFE. HE STARTED YELLING OUT FOR SIG AND SIG WITHOUT REGARD FOR HIS
SAFETY, AFTER GETTING OUT OF A SMOKE-FILLED ROOM WENT BACK IN
AND PULLED TYRONE OUT.
[CHEERING] HE WAS ALSO TALKING ABOUT HIS
KIDS. ALL OF US HAD A LOT OF YOUNG KIDS OUT THERE. JUST ABOUT HIS WIFE HAD BEEN
PREGNANT. HE HAD A NEWBORN BABY COMING. NONE OF US KNEW WE WOULD MAKE IT
HOME OR NOT. THIS WAS GETTING ONTO THAT TIME
IN THE MORNING WHEN THE SUN
STARTS COMING UP AND WE START
SEEING THAT CHANGE ON THE
HORIZON WHERE THE SKY TURNS FROM DARK TO BLUE. ABOUT THE TIME THE CALL FOR PRAYER FINISHED, WE THOUGHT, THE
NEXT ATTACK WILL BE HERE. BY THAT TIME, WHEN WE HEARD OVER THE RADIO THAT THE TEAM FROM
TRIPOLI HAD MADE THEIR WAY TO THE ANNEX AND WERE GETTING READY
TO PULL IN, WHEN THEY DID,
INSTEAD OF GOING INSIDE THE BUILDING, GLENN, HE CAME UP ON
TOP OF THE ROOF. HE WANTED TO GET TO THE FIGHT. HE JOINED US UP THERE. TYRONE INTRODUCED ME TO GOING TO
DIE HAD NEVER MET HIM BEFORE.
FIRST THING OUT OF MY MOUTH WAS
GOOD TO HAVE ANOTHER GUNFIGHTER UP ON TOP OF THE ROOF. HE TURNED AND STARTED WALKING
AWAY FROM IT AND IT WAS AT THAT
TIME THAT THE FINAL ATTACK
STARTED. A ROCKET PROPELLED GRENADE HIT
THE BACK OF THE WALL. SMALL ARMS BY THE OPEN UP FROM
THE NORTH. IN ORDER -- A MORTAR HIT THE
OUTER WALL.
THE STATE DEPARTMENT GUY YELLED
HE WAS HIT. TOOK SOME TROUT NOW TO HIS FOUR
HEAD.
-- SHRAPNEL TO THE FOREHEAD.
WE OPENED THE FIRE. THAT'S WHEN THE SECOND MORTGAGE. KID ABOUT 15 FEET -- HIT ABOUT
15 FEET TO MY RIGHT.
AS I STOOD UP, I NOTICED THAT
TYRONE WAS IN A FETAL POSITION.
I READ MY LEFT HAND UP TO RAISE
MY REBEL AND THAT'S WHEN I NOTICED THAT I WAS INJURED.
I LEFT ARM ABOUT SIX INCHES
ABOVE THE WRIST WAS HANGING OFF
AT A 90 DEGREE ANGLE. IT WAS THEN THAT THE THIRD
MORTAR HIT. AS A GLAZED OVER MY RIGHT SHOULDER, I KNOWS GLENN WAS FACE DOWN AND OUT OF THE FIGHT. I TRIED TO BRING MY ARM UP TO
GRAB MY WEAPON BECAUSE I WANTED
TO GET BACK INTO THE FIGHT. IT JUST WOULD NOT WORK.
I CANNOT GET IT TO HOLD ON. THAT'S WHEN THE FOURTH MORTAR HIT. THAT WAS THE FIRST TIME I FELT
ANY PAIN THAN I DID IT FELT LIKE
I GOT STUNG BY A THOUSAND BEES. I FIGURED AT THAT TIME, THE HARDHEADED MIDTEENS -- MARINES
OUGHT TO GET INTO COVER. ID. DON'T FOR COVER AND
EVERYTHING WENT FINE.
-- DOVE FOR COVER AND EVERYTHING WENT QUIET.
I PULLED THE PRINTED IT OUT.
-- TOURNIQUET OUT. CANNOT FIND A PULSE ON TYRONE. AT THAT TIME, I SAW A SHADOW
COME UP ON THE ROOF AND THAT WAS SIG.
THE DUST AND DEBRIS HAD NOT
FINISHED FALLING WHEN HE GOT UP
ON THE ROOF.</span><span class='hidden-full-transcript-ellipses'>...</span></p><a href='#' class='hidden-full-transcript-link'><i class='icon-chevron-down'></i> <span class='link-show-full-text'>Show Full Text</span><i class='icon-chevron-up'></i> <span class='link-show-less-text'>Show Less Text</span></a>
