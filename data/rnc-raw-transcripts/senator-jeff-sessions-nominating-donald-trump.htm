<strong>Paul D. Ryan</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> MR. RYAN: HEY, EVERYBODY. HEY, WISCONSIN. HELLO, EVERYONE. IT IS AN HONOR TO BE HERE. BEFORE WE BEGIN, I WOULD LIKE TO
REMIND THE DELEGATES OF THE
PROVISIONS<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> OF THE RULES WHICH
REQUIRE EACH CANDIDATE FOR NOMINATION FOR PRESIDENT OF THE
UNITED STATES DEMONSTRATES SUFFICIENT SUPPORT PRIOR TO THE PRESENTATION OF THE NAME OF THE
CANDIDATES FOR NOMINATION.
THE CHAIR WISHES TO INFORM
DELEGATES AT THIS TIME IT HAS BEEN FURNISHED IN A TIMELY MANNER WITH EVIDENCE OF
SUFFICIENT SUPPORT FOR THE
CANDIDATES WHO WILL BE PRESENTED FOR PRESIDENT AND VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES IN
COMPLIANCE WITH THE RULES OF THE
CONVENTION.
[APPLAUSE] ALSO, AS PRESCRIBED UNDER THE RULES, BUT TOTAL TIME FOR NOMINATING SPEECHES FOR ANY
CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT OR VICE
PRESIDENT SHALL NOT EXCEED 15
MINUTES. IT IS ALSO BEEN CUSTOM AT PAST CONVENTIONS FOR THE CHAIR TO RECOGNIZE NON-DELEGATES FOR THE
PURPOSE OF MAKING NOMINATING
SPEECHES AND SECONDING SPEECHES. WITHOUT OBJECTION, THE READING
OF THE ROLLCALL FOR STATES PRESENTING THE NAMES FOR CANDIDATES FOR NOMINATION AND NON-DELEGATES WILL BE PERMITTED TO MAKE NOMINATING AND SECONDING SPEECHES. THE CHAIR NOW RECOGNIZES THE
SENATOR FROM ALABAMA, JEFF SESSIONS, FOR THE PURPOSE OF NOMINATING. PLEASE GIVE HIM A WARM WELCOME.

<strong>Jeff Sessions</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> SEN. SESSIONS: MR. SPEAKER,
AMERICANS LOVE OUR COUNTRY LIKE
NO OTHER PEOPLE ON EARTH.
[APPLAUSE] BUT WE HAVE GONE OFF COURSE AND
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE KNOW<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> IT. OUR POLITICAL SYSTEM IS NOT
WORKING. WE OPERATE LIKE A TRENCH WARFARE BATTLES OF WORLD WAR I WHERE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS DIED BUT
NO GROUND IS GAINED. GOOD AMERICANS WILL STAND FOR
THIS NO LONGER. THEY WANT THE POLITICAL GAME, THE POSTURING AND THE SHOWBOATING TO END. THEY WANT THEIR COUNTRY ON THE RIGHT TRACK AGAIN. MEDIAN INCOME HAS DECLINED. TERRORIST ATTACKS ARE
INCREASING. RESPECT FOR AMERICA HAS FALLEN. CRIME IS RISING. AND THE PRESIDENT, HE BLAMES THE
POLICE. THE PRESIDENT DOES NOT LEAD. CONGRESS IS DEADLOCKED. THE POLITICAL, CORPORATE AND MEDIA ESTABLISHMENT, THEY SAY
CALM DOWN. DON'T OVERREACT, DON'T BE POLITICALLY INCORRECT. UNSTATED IS A THREAT. IF YOU PERSIST IN YOUR COMPLAINTS, WE WILL ATTACK YOU. BUT, THIS TIME IT'S DIFFERENT.
[APPLAUSE] ONE MAN, DONALD TRUMP, WAS NOT
INTIMIDATED.
[APPLAUSE] HE WOULD NOT BE SILENCED. HE SPOKE THE TRUTH. HE GAVE VOICE TO THE PEOPLE'S CONCERNS. HE SAID THAT THE TRADE DEALS HAVE HURT AMERICA AND PEOPLE. THAT OUR BORDER MUST BE
SECURED.
THAT OUR NATION, THAT OUR NATION MUST BE STRONG. THAT WE MUST DEFEAT THE
TERRORISTS WHO THREATEN US. THAT WE MUST RESTORE LAW AND
ORDER. AND, SUPPORT OUR COURAGEOUS LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS.
[APPLAUSE] THE AMERICANS -- THE AMERICAN
VOTERS HEARD THIS
MESSAGE AND THEY WERE BOARDED REWARDED HIS LEADERSHIP WITH A HUGE VICTORY IN OUR PRIMARY. HE DISPATCHED ONE TALENTED, FINE
CANDIDATE AFTER ANOTHER. MOMENTUM CONTINUED TO GROW.
A MOVEMENT STARTED. DEMOCRATS AND INDEPENDENTS
RESPONDED. HE RECEIVED FAR MORE PRIMARY
VOTES THAN ANY REPUBLICAN
CANDIDATE IN HISTORY.
[APPLAUSE] LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT THE DONALD
TRUMP I HAVE COME TO KNOW. HE HAS A WONDERFUL FAMILY WHICH
HE LOVES INTENSELY. HIS PERSONAL RELATIONS, HE'S UNFAILING COURTEOUS AND GENEROUS
AND POSITIVE BY NATURE. HE HAS TREMENDOUS ENERGY AND STRENGTH.
HE IS A WARRIOR AND A WINNER. HE LOVES HIS COUNTRY AND HE IS DETERMINED TO SEE IT BE A WINNER AGAIN. I HAVE BEEN PROUD OF THIS PARTY AND ITS PRINCIPLE
SINCE I WAS A TEENAGER. IT IS NOT GIVEN TO US TO SEE
THE FUTURE BUT I CAME TO BELIEVE
SOME MONTHS AGO THAT DONALD
TRUMP IS THE SINGULAR LEADER
THAT CAN GET THIS COUNTRY BACK
ON TRACK.
[APPLAUSE] HE HAS THE STRENGTH, THE COURAGE AND WILL TO GET IT DONE. HE AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE SHARE A COMMON GOAL, AND TOGETHER, WE WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN.
[APPLAUSE] MR. SPEAKER, MR. SPEAKER, IT
IS MY DISTINCT HONOR AND GREAT PLEASURE TO NOMINATE DONALD J. TRUMP FOR THE OFFICE OF PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
OF AMERICA. THANK YOU. AND GOD BLESS.
[APPLAUSE]
