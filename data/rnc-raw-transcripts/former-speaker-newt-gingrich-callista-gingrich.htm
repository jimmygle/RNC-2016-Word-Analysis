<strong>Newt Gingrich</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> THANK YOU FOR THAT VERY
GENEROUS WELCOME. AND THANK YOU CALLISTA, SHE
WRITES DOCUMENTARY FILM'S, RIGHT
BOOKS, SINGS IN A CHOIR, PLAYS
THE FRENCH HORN,<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> I'M AMAZED AT
HER ACHIEVEMENTS. I'M ALSO PROUD TO BE HERE AS A REPUBLICAN ACTIVIST TO SEE THE EXTRA EFFORT DONALD TRUMP HAS INVESTED IN BRINGING YOUR PELICAN PARTY TOGETHER.
[CHEERING] WITH NO REQUIREMENT FOR ENDORSEMENT, HE ENCOURAGES
COMPETITORS TO SPEAK ONCE AGAIN. GOVERNOR RICK PERRY, DONOR CHRIS
CHRISTIE, GOVERNOR SCOTT WALKER, DR. BEN CARSON, SENATOR RUBIO AND SENATOR TED CRUZ HAVE ALL RESPONDED TO DONALD COMES
GENEROSITY.
[CHEERING] I THINK YOU MISUNDERSTOOD ONE PARAGRAPH THAT TED CRUZ, IT WAS A SUPERB ORATOR SAID, I WANT TO
POINTED OUT TO YOU, TED CRUZ SAID YOU CAN VOTE YOUR
CONSCIENCE FOR ANYONE WHO WILL
UPHOLD THE CONSTITUTION. IN THIS ELECTION, THERE IS ONLY ONE CANDIDATE WHO WILL UPHOLD
THE CONSTITUTION.
[CHEERING] TO PARAPHRASE TED CRUZ, IF YOU WANT TO PROTECT THE CONSTITUTION OF UNITED STATES, THE ONLY
POSSIBLE CANDIDATE THIS FALL IS THE TRUMP-PENCE REPUBLICAN
TICKET.
[CHEERING] THAT WAY WE HAVE THE REPUBLICAN
TICKET TO IMPLEMENT REPUBLICAN PRINCIPLES IN WASHINGTON. WHAT I WANT TO FOCUS ON IS THE SUBJECT THAT IS DOMINATED BY THINKING FOR DECADES, HOW DO WE
KEEP AMERICA SAFE? KEEPING AMERICA SAFE IS THE
FIRST RESPONSIBILITY OF THE PRINT -- PRESIDENT. ANY FASCINATING THINGS TO WATCH
ABOUT THE EXTRA ORDINARY
HISTORIC RISE OF DONALD TRUMP ARE THE MOST SIGNIFICANT HAS BEEN DONALD COMES COURAGE TO
TELL SOME IMPORTANT TRUTHS ABOUT
OUR NATIONAL SECURITY. FOR EXAMPLE, WE ARE AT WAR. WE ARE AT WAR WITH ARTICLE ISLAMIST, THEY ARE DETERMINED TO
KILL US.
THEY ARE STRONGER THAN WE ADMIT
AND THERE IS NO SUBSTITUTE FOR
VICTORY.
[CHEERING] IN CONTRAST TO DONALD TRUMP, OUR NATIONAL SECURITY AND FOREIGN POLICY ELITES ARE INCAPABLE OF SPEAKING WITH SUCH HONESTY WHILE THEY LIE ABOUT THE THREAT. WE NEED TO TELL THE TRUTH ABOUT THE DANGER. IF OUR ENEMIES HAVE THEIR WAY, NOT A SINGLE WOMAN IN THIS ROOM COULD DEFINE HER FUTURE.
IF OUR ENEMIES HAVE THEIR WAY, GAYS, LESBIANS, TRANSGENDER
CITIZENS WOULD BE PUT TO DEATH AS THEY ARE TODAY AND THE ISLAMIC STATE.
IF OUR ENEMIES HAD THEIR WAY,
EVERY PERSON ON EARTH WOULD BE
SUBJECT TO CONVERSION BY THE
SWORD AND A CRUEL AND VIOLENT
SYSTEM OF LAW. THERE WOULD BE NO INDIVIDUAL
LIBERTY.
THERE WOULD BE NO EQUALITY.
THERE WOULD BE NO FREEDOM. IF YOU DOUBT WE ARE AT WAR, IF YOU DOUBT THAT THE THREAT IS AS REAL AS I SAID, LET ME REFRESH YOUR MEMORY. ON MONDAY, AN AFGHAN REFUGEE IN GERMANY USED IN ACTS AND -- AXE AND KNIFE TO STOP PASSENGERS.
ISIS CLAIMED RESPONSIBLY AFTER A
TUNISIAN MAN DRIVEN CARGO CROCK
-- TRUCK INTO A CROWD OF FRIENDS.
HE MURDERED 84 PEOPLE INCLUDING
10 CHILDREN. INJURED OVER 300 OTHER 32 WEEKS
AGO, ALMOST 300 PEOPLE WERE KILLED AND MORE THAN 200 WOUNDED AND BOMBING ATTACKS IN BAGHDAD.
TWO DAYS BEFORE THAT, RADICAL ISLAMISTS IN BANGLADESH KILLED 20 HOSTAGES, INCLUDING THREE
AMERICAN COLLEGE STUDENTS. A FEW DAYS BEFORE THAT, AT THE US TEMPLE AIRPORT IN TURKEY, ISIS ATTACKERS ARMED WITH GUNS AND BOMBS KILLED 44 PEOPLE AND
INJURED HUNDREDS MORE. LAST MONTH, A RADICAL ISLAMIST IN PARIS STOCK TO FRENCH POLICE
OFFICER TO HIS HOME WHERE HE
MURDERED THE OFFICER, TORTURED
HIS WIFE TO DEATH IN FRONT OF
THE THREE OLD SON WHILE STREAMING IT ALL ON SOCIAL
MEDIA. HE WAS PUTTERED OUT LOUD WHETHER TO KILL THE THREE-YEAR-OLD WHEN
HE WAS KILLED BY POLICE. THREE DAYS BEFORE THAT, AN
ATTACKER PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE TO
EXIST AND 49 PEOPLE IN AN
ORLANDO NIGHTCLUB AND WOUNDED
DOZENS MORE. ALL OF THIS IN JUST THE PAST 37
DAYS. WE CANNOT LET OURSELVES GROAN HIM TO THE CIRCULATING -- GRO W NUMB TO BE SPECULATING
ATROCITIES.
[CHEERING] ONE ANONYMOUS -- ANALYSIS ESTIMATED SINCE JANUARY, 2015, SOME 30,000 PEOPLE HAVE BEEN
KILLED AT THE HANDS OF
TERRORISTS. LET'S BE CLEAR, DONALD TRUMP IS
RIGHT. WE ARE AT WAR WITH RADICAL
ISLAMISTS, WE ARE LOSING THE WAR
AND WE MUST CHANGE COURSE TO WIN
THE WAR.
[CHEERING] LET ME BE VERY CLEAR, BECAUSE I
KNOW THE NEWS MEDIA WILL DO THEIR BEST TO DISTORT THIS, WE
HAVE NOTHING TO FEAR FROM THE VAST MAJORITY OF MUSLIMS IN THE
UNITED STATES OR AROUND THE
WORLD, THE VAST MAJORITY ARE
PEACEFUL.
THEY ARE OFTEN THE VICTIMS
THEMSELVES. THEY ARE PEOPLE WE WOULD BE
HAPPY TO HAVE AS OUR FRIENDS AND
NEIGHBORS.
[CHEERING] THE CHALLENGE IS WHEN EVEN A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF A BILLION
PEOPLE SUPPORT VIOLENCE AGAINST
THOSE WHO DISAGREE WITH THEM,
THAT IS STILL A GIANT RECRUITING
BASE. FOR EXAMPLE, THE RESEARCH FINDS THAT ONLY 9% OF MUSLIMS IN PAKISTAN VIEW ISIS FAVORABLY. UNFORTUNATELY, 9% IS 16 MILLION PEOPLE THAT IS JUST ONE COUNTRY. THE TRUTH IS ALL THAT WE ARE LOSING THE WAR WITH RADICAL ISLAMISTS, WE HAVE BEEN VERY
LUCKY. THE DANGER WE FACE IS MUCH WORSE
THAN THE HORSE THAT HAPPEN IN
GERMANY ON NEW YEAR'S EVE WHEN
1200 WOMEN WERE ASSAULTED. IT IS WORSE THAN WHAT IS
HAPPENING IN FRANCE WHERE THERE ARE STABBINGS OF JEWS IN THE STREETS AND THE NATION SECURITY CHIEF WARNED RECITE THAT EUROPE
IS ON THE BRINK OF CIVIL WAR. IT IS WORTH THAT WHAT IS HAPPENING IN ISRAEL WHEN AVERAGE CITIZENS FEAR FOR THEIR LIVES
WHENEVER THEY LEAVE THEIR HOMES. THE DANGER IS WORTH THAN
SEPTEMBER 11 WHEN 19 HIJACKERS
MURDERED ALMOST 3000 AMERICANS. THE WORST-CASE SCENARIO IS LOSING AN AMERICAN CITY TO
TERRORISTS ARMED WITH WEAPONS OF
MASS DESTRUCTION. INSTEAD OF LOSING 3000 PEOPLE IN
ONE MORNING, WE COULD LOSE MORE
THAN 300,000. INSTEAD OF LOSING TWO GREAT
BUILDINGS, WE COULD LOSE BLOCK
AFTER BLOCK AFTER BLOCK TO A
NUCLEAR EVENT.
THAT IS NOT JUST MY VIEW, BACK
IN JANUARY OF 2001, THE
COMMISSION WARNED THE TERRORIST QUOTE WILL REQUIRE -- ACQUIRE
WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION AND
SOME WILL USE THEM. AMERICANS WILL LIKELY DIE ON
AMERICAN SOIL, POSSIBLY IN LARGE NUMBERS.
15 YEARS LATER, DANGEROUS OR
GREATER THAN A WORLD WHERE
PAKISTAN HAS NUCLEAR WEAPONS,
NORTH KOREA HAS BEEN WEAPONS AND I RAN -- IRAN IS CLOSE TO HAVING
NUCLEAR WEAPONS. THIS IS A VERY REAL THREAT. THIS BRIEF IS THE HEART OF THE MATTER, WE ARE SLEEPWALKING
THROUGH HISTORY AS THOUGH THIS
IS ALL ABOUT POLITICS.
IT IS NOT.
[CHEERING] IT IS ABOUT OUR SAFETY AND
SURVIVAL OF THE COUNTRY. WE CANNOT KEEP IN PLACE THE
PEOPLE AND THE SYSTEMS THAT HAVE BROUGHT US TO THIS POINT AND
THEN LIE TO US EVERY SINGLE DAY ABOUT THE THREAT. THAT IS WHY EVERY AMERICAN SHOULD BE TERRIFIED AT THE
PROSPECT OF A HILLARY CLINTON
PRESIDENCY. HILLARY CLINTON HAS BEEN RIGHT
AT THE CENTER OF THIS
DISHONESTY. WE KNOW THIS AND MINISTRATION
AND THE ALLIES LIED TO US ABOUT
THE IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL. WE KNOW IT BECAUSE THEY OPENLY
BRAGGED ABOUT IT TO THE OLD -- NEW YORK TIMES BETWEEN A FULLY CLINTON LIED ABOUT US KNOW IN
THE ABOUT THE TERROR ATTACK IN
BENGHAZI.
WE KNOW THAT HILLARY CLINTON AND
PRESIDENT OBAMA LIE TO THE
AMERICAN PEOPLE WHEN THEY SAID
THEY CAN SAFELY SCREEN THE
SYRIAN REFUGEES.
THEY CANNOT. AND YET, HILLARY WAS TO INCREASE
THE NUMBER OF REFUGEES BY 500%.
WHEN YOU HEAR ABOUT HILLARY'S DISHONESTY, REMEMBER, THIS IS
NOT ABOUT POLITICS. THE COST OF HILLARY'S DISHONESTY
TO THE LOSS OF AMERICA AS WE
KNOW IT.
[CHEERING] THE FIRST OF FOUR TO SAFETY IS
ELECTED A LEADER WHO WILL BE
TRUTHFUL WITH THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ABOUT THE REALITIES WE
FACE. ONLY THEN WILL WE UNDERSTAND
SUPPORT AND DEMAND THAT STRATEGIES REQUIRE TO CONFRONT THE THREAT AND BECAUSE SAFETY
AND SECURITY OF THE PRECONDITIONS FOR OUR FREEDOM AND PROSPERITY. IT IS ALSO THE FIRST STEP
TOWARDS REBUILDING THE AMERICA
WE LOVE. DONALD TRUMP UNDERSTANDS THIS. THAT IS WHY HE WILL REBUILD OUR
MILITARY BECAUSE HE KNOWS THAT A
STRONG MILITARY IS THE BEST WAY
TO SECURE PEACE. DONALD TRUMP WILL SECURE OUR BORDERS BECAUSE THERE IS NO SUCH
THING AS A NATION WITHOUT A
QUARTER. DONALD TRUMP WILL ENFORCE IMMIGRATION LAWS, HE WILL END
THE POLICY OF NONENFORCEMENT AND
AND THE ABUSE OF OUR VISA PROGRAM TO PROTECT AMERICAN
WORKERS.
DONALD TRUMP WILL TAKE CARE OF
OUR VETERANS BY HOLDING
BUREAUCRATS ACCOUNTABLE. HE WILL FAR THOSE RESPONSIBLE
FOR THE WAITING LISTS AND WILL GIVE VETERANS MORE CHOICES ABOUT
THEIR CARE. WITH DONALD TRUMP'S LEADERSHIP, NO PURE CAT WILL GET BETWEEN A VETERAN AND THEIR DOCTOR.
[CHEERING] DONALD TRUMP WILL GET AMERICA VOTING AGAIN.
HE WILL BLOW APART THE RIDICULOUS REGULATIONS AND REQUIREMENTS THAT THE -- DRIVE INFRASTRUCTURE COST AND THE TIME
I TO GET THINGS BUILD. THE DOLLAR COMPANY FOR SUCH A PROGRAM MAKE US ONCE AGAIN THE
MOST COMPETITIVE ECONOMY IN THE
WORLD. DONALD TRUMP WILL REBUILD OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM AND GIVE EVERY PARENT OF EVERY INCOME AND EVERY ETHNIC BACKGROUND A CHOICE ABOUT WHERE THEIR CHILD GOES TO
SCHOOL. DONALD TRUMP WILL HELP US
REBUILD AND STRENGTHEN THE
COMMUNITY.
[CHEERING] HERE AGAIN, THE FIRST OF THE SAFETY.
THE BASIS FOR STRONG FAMILIES
AND A GOOD JOBS AND VIBRANT
NEIGHBORHOODS, THAT MEANS
RESTORING LAW AND ORDER. DONALD TRUMP WILL SHOWED ZERO-TOLERANCE FOR PEOPLE CALLING TO THE DEATH OF POLICE
OFFICERS.
[CHEERING] THINK ABOUT THIS. IF ANYONE PUBLICLY THREATENS THE
LIFE OF A PRESIDENT IN, THE SECRET SERVICE IS ON THE MEN AN INSTANT.
OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS DESERVE THE SAME RESPECT AS THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.
[CHEERING] OF COURSE IF INDIVIDUAL OFFICERS ARE THOUGHT TO HAVE VIOLATED
SOMEONE ELSE'S RIGHTS, PAGE MUST
BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE UNDER THE
LAW. WE ARE ONE NATION UNDER GOD,
WITH LIBERTY AND JUSTICE ARE
ALL. THAT HAS ALLOWED US TO ABSORB
MORE PEOPLE FROM OUR BACKGROUNDS THAN ANY NATION IN HISTORY. NOBODY IS ABOVE THE LAW AND NOBODY IS TOO SMALL TO DESERVE
THE PROTECTION. DONALD TRUMP ONE OUR PARTY'S
NOMINATION BECAUSE HE IS WILLING
TO TELL THE TRUTH ABOUT THE
THINGS THAT MATTER. HE IS A GREAT RUNNING MATE AND
MIKE PENCE. THEY WILL PUT OUR SAFETY FIRST
AND THEY WILL DEFEND AMERICA FIRST.
[CHEERING] WE CAN BE PROUD TO STAND WITH THEM. TONIGHT, THE CHALLENGE FOR
EVERYONE IN THIS HALL AND EVERYONE REPUBLICAN, DEMOCRAT,
INDEPENDENT WATCH AT HOME AND
THOSE WE CANNOT CONCUR -- CONTINUE ON THE CURRENT COURSE,
WE MUST RISE ABOVE THE POLITICS
WE HAVE INHERITED. IGNORE THE LIVES OF THE NEWS
MEDIA AND OLD ORDER. REJECT THE DISHONESTY OF HILLARY CLINTON. STAND WITH DONALD TRUMP AND MIKE PENCE FOR WHAT WE KNOW IS TRUE. WE CAN MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN,
WE CAN MAKE AMERICA WORK AGAIN,
WE CAN MAKE AMERICA FIRST AGAIN AND TOGETHER, WE CAN MAKE
AMERICA GREAT AGAIN FOR ALL
AMERICANS. THANK YOU AND GOD BLESS YOU.
