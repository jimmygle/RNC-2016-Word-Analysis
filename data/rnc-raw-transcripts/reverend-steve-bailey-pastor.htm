<strong>Steven R. Bailey</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> LET US PRAY. THE ETERNAL GOD, WE INVITE YOUR
SPIRIT TO COME INTO THIS ROOM AND GUIDE OUR ACTIONS TONIGHT. OUR FAITH AND TRADITIONS ARE
UNITED IN RECOGNITION<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> THAT YOU
ARE THE CREATOR OF ALL THAT IS. YOU MOVE ON A SCALE AND IN WAYS THAT WE CAN SCARCELY COMPREHEND, BUT YOUR GRACE AND LOVE REACHED
THROUGH SPACE AND TIME TO CLAIM US, GUIDE US, AND MAKE US YOUR
OWN. WE ARE NOT HERE TONIGHT TO ASK
YOU TO BLESS BUT WE HAVE DESIGNED.
-- WHAT WE HAVE DESIGNED. WE ARE HERE TO ASK YOU TO TRANSFORM US, TO MAKE US BETTER, MAKE US COURAGEOUS, MAKE US TIRELESS IN SEEKING A MORE JUST NATION FOR ALL WHO LIVE IN THIS
LAND. WE ARE UNITED IN OUR DISCONTENT,
FOR WE KNOW THE WORLD CAN BE
MADE BETTER. WE KNOW THAT IT IS NOT RIGHT
THAT RACISM CONTINUES TO WOUND
AND DESTROY THE LIVES OF MANY IN THIS LAND

TO INSTABILITY RECEIVED AT THE
GROCERY STORE OR ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES, WE KNOW THAT WE WILL
ONLY BE A GREAT NATION WHEN WE
ARE A GOOD NATION. WHEN EVERY CITIZEN IS FULLY
VESTED IN THE PROMISE OF CITIZENSHIP AND SHARES IN THE
OPPORTUNITIES OF THIS GREAT
LAND. WE KNOW THAT IT IS NOT RIGHT
WHEN LIVES ARE DESTROYED BY ADDICTION, WHEN OUR JUSTICE SYSTEM FAVOR SOME PUNISHES OTHER, WHEN CHILDREN AND WOMEN ARE TRAFFICKED IN OUR STREETS OR
WHEN PEOPLE ARE DENIGRATED BECAUSE OF WHO THEY ARE, OR WHOM
THEY LOVE. WE KNOW THAT IT IS NOT RIGHT WHEN WE STAND IN THE STREETS AND
SHOUT INSULTS AT EACH OTHER, WHEN WE ATTACKED THOSE WHO RISK THEIR LIVES TO PROTECT US, WHEN
WE HARDEN OUR HEARTS TO THOSE WE
CALL THE ENEMY, WHEN WE CAN NO
LONGER FIND COMMON GROUND UPON WHICH WE CAN BUILD A BETTER
FUTURE, FORGIVE US GOD, ETERNAL
GOD, HOPE OF ALL WHO CALL OUT TO YOU, WORKED FOR OUR LEADERS WHO
HAVE BEEN ENTRUSTED TO ACT ON
OUR BEHALF. REMIND US THAT AS WE WIELDED
GREAT POWER, WE ALSO BEAR GREAT
RESPONSIBILITY. REMIND US THAT EACH OF OUR LIVES MATTERS, OUR VOICE, OUR EXAMPLE, OUR VALUES AND OUR SERVICE. MAY WE EACH BEATIFIC POINT WHERE THE WORLD SWINGS FROM WHAT IS TO WHAT IT CAN BE.
YOU BY DIFFERENT NAMES, WE MAY PRAY IN DIFFERENT LANGUAGES, WE
MAY COME FROM A MULTITUDE OF PERSPECTIVES, BUT TONIGHT, WE
SHARE THIS MOMENT IN HISTORY AS WE LIVE TOGETHER ON THIS FRAGILE PLANET. GIVE US GRACE, IT WAS COURAGE,
GIVE US COMPASSION AND GIVE US
HOPE.
AMEN.
