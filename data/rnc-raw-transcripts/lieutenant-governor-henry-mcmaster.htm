<strong>Chris Collins</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> MR. COLLINS: THANK YOU, MY FELLOW NEW YORKERS. SPEAKER RYAN, THANK YOU FOR YOUR
INTRODUCTION. THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP
AND WILLINGNESS TO PUT FORTH<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> POLICIES THAT WILL TRULY MAKE
AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. AS THE FIRST MEMBER OF CONGRESS
TO ENDORSE DONALD TRUMP, I ALSO
WANT TO THANK SENATOR SESSIONS
WHO HAS STOOD WITH ME FROM THE
BEGINNING IN SUPPORT OF DONALD
TRUMP.
[APPLAUSE] I PROUDLY REPRESENT WESTERN NEW YORK. WHICH HAS BEEN DEVASTATED BY
UNFAIR TRADE DEALS, ALLOWING
COUNTRIES LIKE CHINA AND MEXICO
TO STEAL OUR JOBS, ROBBING OUR CHILDREN OF THE OPPORTUNITY TO
LIVE THE AMERICAN DREAM. THE STAKES IN THIS ELECTION CANNOT BE OVERSTATED. WE WILL EITHER MAKE
AMERICA GREAT AGAIN OR TRAVEL
DOWN THE PATH OF A THIRD OBAMA
TERM.
[BOOING] UNDER BARACK OBAMA, WE HAVE BEEN LOSING. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TRAMPLES ON OUR RIGHTS. OUR ALLIES CAN NO LONGER DEPEND ON US. OUR ENEMIES DEFY US. OUR COUNTRY HAS NO BORDERS AND
CHINA AND MEXICO CONTINUE TO
STEAL OUR JOBS. ENOUGH IS ENOUGH.
[APPLAUSE] IT IS TIME TO TAKE BACK OUR COUNTRY, THE GREAT UNITED STATES
OF AMERICA.
[APPLAUSE] PRESIDENT TRUMP IS GOING TO BUILD A WALL AND SECURE OUR
BORDERS.
[APPLAUSE] PRESIDENT TRUMP IS GOING TO DEFEAT TERRORISM AND MAKE OUR
COUNTRY SAFE AGAIN.
[APPLAUSE] PRESIDENT TRUMP IS GOING TO
BRING BACK OUR STOLEN JOBS. WE IN WESTERN NEW YORK KNOW DONALD TRUMP IS NOT MERELY A CANDIDATE, DONALD TRUMP IS A
MOVEMENT.
[APPLAUSE] THAT IS WHY, MR. SPEAKER, I HAVE
THE HONOR OF SECONDING THE
NOMINATION OF DONALD J. TRUMP AS THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED
STATES OF AMERICA.
[APPLAUSE] YOU GOT IT. THANK YOU ALL. THANK YOU ALL. THANK YOU.</span><span class='hidden-full-transcript-ellipses'>...</span></p><a href='#' class='hidden-full-transcript-link'><i class='icon-chevron-down'></i> <span class='link-show-full-text'>Show Full Text</span><i class='icon-chevron-up'></i> <span class='link-show-less-text'>Show Less Text</span></a>

<p class='short_transcript'> LT. GOV. MCMASTER: THANK YOU,
MR. SPEAKER. HELLO, DELEGATES.
ISN'T THIS WONDERFUL? I'M SO HAPPY TO BE HERE WITH YOU.
I ASKED PEGGY, MY WIFE, IF SHE HAD<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> EVER IN HER WILDEST DREAMS SEEN ME STANDING HERE NOMINATING
DONALD TRUMP FOR PRESIDENT.
PEGGY SAID, "I HATE TO TELL YOU BUT I HAVE NEVER SEEN YOU IN ANY OF MY WILDEST DREAMS.
"
[LAUGHTER] LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THIS IS NOT A DREAM.
THIS IS THE REAL THING. THIS IS DEADLY SERIOUS.
WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO. THEY TELL ME I WAS THE FIRST
ELECTED OFFICIAL TO ENDORSE
DONALD TRUMP IN THE COUNTRY AND
IT WAS LONELY FOR A WHILE, BUT
NO MORE. SO, IT IS WITH GREATEST PRIDE
AND HAPPINESS THAT I SECOND HIS NOMINATION FOR PRESIDENT OF THE
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.
[APPLAUSE] YES. ON DECEMBER 7, 1941, AFTER THE
WITHERING ATTACK ON PEARL HARBOR, ADMIRAL YAMAMOTA SAID</p><a href='#' class='hidden-full-transcript-link'><i class='icon-chevron-down'></i> <span class='link-show-full-text'>Show Full Text</span><i class='icon-chevron-up'></i> <span class='link-show-less-text'>Show Less Text</span></a>
