<strong>John A. Barrasso</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> SEN. BARRASSO: THANK YOU. WHO IS PROUD TO BE AN AMERICAN?
[APPLAUSE] MY NAME IS JOHN BARRASSO, A
UNITED STATES SENATOR FROM THE
GREAT STATE OF WYOMING.<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> IT HAS BEEN MY HONOR TO SERVE
YOU AS CHAIRMAN OF THE PLATFORM
COMMITTEE. I WANT TO SAY FIRST, YOU CAN BE VERY PROUD OF THE DELEGATES THAT
YOU CHOSE TO REPRESENT YOU
DURING OUR COMMITTEE
PROCEEDINGS. THEY WERE TOUGH, INTELLIGENT, AND THEY WORK WITH GREAT
CIVILITY IN COMMON PURPOSE TO
WRITE A REPUBLICAN PLATFORM THAT
REAFFIRMS THE PRINCIPLES THAT
UNITE US. WHAT THEY ACHIEVED CAN BE
SUMMARIZED SIMPLY -- WE BELIEVE THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA IS
UNLIKE ANY OTHER NATION ON EARTH.
[APPLAUSE] WE BELIEVE AMERICA IS EXCEPTIONAL BECAUSE OF OUR HISTORIC ROLE, FIRST AS REFUGE,
THEN AS THE VENDOR, AND NOW AS
EXEMPLARY OF LIBERTY FOR THE
WORLD TO SEE. WE AFFIRM THEM AS TO THE
DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE,
THAT ALL ARE CREATED EQUAL,
ENDOWED BY THEIR CREATOR WITH AN
INALIENABLE RIGHTS TO LIFE, LIBERTY, AND THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS. WE BELIEVE IN THE CONSTITUTION
AS OUR FOUNDING DOCUMENT AND OUR
ENDURING COVENANT.
[APPLAUSE] WE BELIEVE OUR CONSTITUTIONAL SYSTEM, LIMITED GOVERNMENT,
SEPARATION OF POWERS,
FEDERALISM, AND THE RIGHTS OF
THE PEOPLE MUST BE PRESERVED
UNCOMPROMISED FOR FUTURE
GENERATIONS.
[APPLAUSE] WE BELIEVE THAT PEOPLE ARE THE ULTIMATE RESOURCE AND THAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, NOT THE GOVERNMENT, ARE THE BEST
STEWARDS OF OUR COUNTRY'S GOD-GIVEN NATURAL RESOURCES. AS AMERICANS AND AS REPUBLICANS, WE WISH FOR PEACE SO THAT WE INSIST ON STRENGTH. WE SEEK FRIENDSHIP WITH ALL NATIONS, BUT WE BASED ON THESE PRINCIPLES, THIS PLATFORM IS AN INVITATION AND A
ROADMAP. IT INVITES EVERY AMERICAN TO JOIN US AND IT SHOWS THE PATH TO A STRONGER, SAFER AND MORE PROSPEROUS AMERICA. FOR THE PAST EIGHT YEARS,
AMERICA HAS BEEN LED IN THE WRONG DIRECTION. OUR ECONOMY HAS BECOME UNNECESSARILY WEAK. TWTOO MANY AMERICANS LIVE PAYCHECK TO PAYCHECK,
STRUGGLING, SUFFER SACRIFICING. WOROUR ENEMIES NO LONGER FEAR US AND OUR FRIENDS NO LONGER TRUST
US. THE MEN AND WOMEN OF OUR MILITARY REMAIN THE WORLD'S
BEST.
[APPLAUSE] THEY HAVE BEEN SHORTCHANGED IN NUMBERS, EQUIPMENT AND BENEFITS. THE PRESIDENT AND THE DEMOCRATIC
PARTY HAVE DISMANTLED AMERICA SYSTEM OF HEALTH CARE. THEY REPLACED IT WITH A COSTLY AND COMPLICATED SCHEME THAT LIMITS CHOICES AND TAKES AWAY
OUR FREEDOMS. THE PRESIDENT AND THE DEMOCRATIC
PARTY HAVE ABANDONED THEIR
PROMISE OF BEING ACCOUNTABLE. THEY REFUSE TO CONTROL OUR BORDERS, BUT TRY TO CONTROL OUR SCHOOLS, FARMS, BUSINESSES AND
EVEN OUR RELIGIOUS INSTITUTIONS.
[APPLAUSE] THEY HAVE DIRECTLY ATTACKED THE
PRODUCTION OF AMERICAN ENERGY AND THE JOBS THAT HAVE SUSTAINED FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES. THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN
REGULATING TO DEATH A FREE MARKET ECONOMY THAT HE DOES NOT LIKE AND DOES NOT UNDERSTAND. ALL THIS IS ALL TOO FAMILIAR. IT HARKENS BACK TO THE WORLD OF
1980, WHEN AN EQUALLY DISCREDITED PRESIDENCY WAS
CALLED TO ACCOUNT BY THE
AMERICAN ELECTORATE. OUR RESPONSE THEN WAS A REPUBLICAN PLATFORM WHICH TOLD
THE TRUTH. IT TOLD THE TRUTH ABOUT OUR
COUNTRY'S PERIL AND OUR NATIN ON'S PROSPECTS.W
DO THE WE DO THE SAME TODAY WITH THE SAME UNITY AND SAME COURAGE
SHOWED BY THOSE FOR SOME 36
YEARS AGO MADE THE REAGAN
PLATFORM A MANIFESTO OF OPPORTUNITY FOR EVERYONE.
[APPLAUSE] LET US REMEMBER AND REPEAT FOR A NEW ERA AND FOR NEW GENERATIONS THEIR CONCLUDING SUMMONS.
SO IN THIS REPUBLICAN PLATFORM, WE CALL OUT TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WITH GODS'S HELP, LET
US ALL NOW TOGETHER MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN.
[APPLAUSE] LET US NOW TOGETHER MAKE A NEW BEGINNING.
[APPLAUSE] AND NOW, PLEASE JOIN ME IN WELCOMING ONE OF THE COCHAIRS OF
THE PLATFORM COMMITTEE, THE
GOVERNOR OF THE GREAT STATE OF OKLAHOMA, GOVERNOR MARY FALLIN.

<strong>Mary Fallin</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> GOV. FALLIN: THANK YOU, SENATOR. I HAVE ONE QUESTION. WHO OUT THERE IS AN AMERICAN PATRIOT WHO IS WILLING TO STAND UP AND FIGHT TO MAKE OUR COUNTRY
GREAT<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> AGAIN?
[APPLAUSE] ABSOLUTELY, ABSOLUTELY. IT HAS BEEN A GREAT PLEASURE AND HONOR TO HAVE SERVED AS THE
COCHAIR OF THIS YEAR'S PLATFORM COMMITTEE WITH OUR CHAIRMAN
SENATOR JOHN GRASSO AND OUR COCHAIRMAN CONGRESSWOMAN VIRGINIA FOXX. WE HAVE ACCOMPLISHED WHAT A LOT
HAVE THOUGHT WAS IMPOSSIBLE. WE HAVE COME TOGETHER WITH ONE
PARTY AND WHAT PLATFORM -- ONE
PLATFORM WITH A WIDE RANGE OF
VIEWS AND POLICIES. A WINNING AND CONSERVATIVE
PLATFORM AND A PATH FORWARD FOR
NOT JUST OUR PARTY BUT FOR THE
ENTIRE NATION. THE PLATFORM IS AMONG THE MOST IMPORTANT WORK WE DO AS A PARTY. IT IS A REFLECTION OF WHO WE ARE
AND WHAT WE STAND FOR, AND PERHAPS MORE THAN ANY OTHER
SINGLE DOCUMENT WE COULD
PRODUCE, IT CAN CHANGE THE WAY PEOPLE THINK IN THE DIRECTION OF
OUR COUNTRY. THAT IS WHAT IT DID FOR ME.
WHEN I WAS 18, MY PARENTS TOLD
ME TO VOTE AND TO VOTE AS A
DEMOCRAT. THEY WERE DEEPLY COMMITTED TO
THEIR PARTY AND I KNOW THEY EXPECTED ME TO BE THAT WAY. BUT THEY ALSO TOLD ME TO BE AN INDEPENDENT THINKER. IN COLLEGE, I WAS SHOWN BY A FRIEND A ONE-PAGE SUMMARY OF THE
REPUBLICAN PLATFORM. 10 PRINCIPLES THAT DEFINED THE REPUBLICANS. I COMPARED IT LINE BY LINE TO
THE DEMOCRATS. FOR ALL MY FAMILY'S HISTORY,
THERE IS ONE DOCUMENT, ONE PARTY
PLATFORM MADE ME INTO A REPUBLICAN.
[APPLAUSE] I HAVE SEEN HOW THE PROCESS
WORKS. I COMPARED IT TO HER DEMOCRATIC COLLEAGUES. OUR'S WAS OPEN, A BOTTOM-UP
PROCESS WITH PARTICIPATING OF
112 COMMITTED DELEGATES. WE READ COMMENTS AND IDEAS FROM
GOOD REPUBLICANS ONLINE AND
AROUND THE COUNTRY AND THROUGH 11 SESSIONS. WE TELEVISED ALL OF OUR DELIBERATIONS AND THEN WE CAME TOGETHER ON PRINCIPLES BASED ON
STRONG FAMILY VALUES, A STRONG NATIONAL DEFENSE, SUPPORT FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT AND INDIVIDUAL LIBERTY. WE NEVER FORGET THESE ARE WHAT MAKE AMERICANS EXCEPTIONAL. VALUES THAT SOME TAKE FOR GRANTED, WHICH IS SOMETHING WE
REPUBLICANS WILL NEVER DO. THE PROCESS THE DEMOCRATS USE IS NOT ONLY DIFFERENT IN THE WAY
THEY DID IT BACK IN MY PARENTS'
DAY, IN A BACK ROOM WITH 15 INDIVIDUALS HAND-PICKED BY ENTITLED LEADERS AND A SECRETIVE PROCESS. AWAY FROM ALL AMERICAN PEOPLE. THEIR'S IS A SECRETIVE, TOP-DOWN PROCESS AND A RESULT IS
A PLATFORM WHICH REFLECTS A HOUSE DIVIDED WITH NO ATTENTION
TO THIS SERIOUS CONCERNS OF
AMERICANS TODAY. I WANT TO THANK OUR LEADERS,
PARTICULARLY THE 112 MEMBERS OF
OUR PLATFORM COMMITTEE, AND ALL
OF OUR DEDICATED STAFF FOR THEIR
HARD WORK AND COMMITMENT TO UNITY AS WE HEAD INTO THE NOVEMBER ELECTIONS. THE DOCUMENT WE PRODUCED IS ONE
THAT WE AND OUR ELECTED OFFICIALS AND OUR PARTY CAN BE
VERY PROUD OF. GOD BLESS THE COMMITTEE AND
THANK YOU FOR ALL YOUR WORK.
[APPLAUSE] PLEASE WELCOME MY FELLOW COCHAIR
OF THE PLATFORM COMMITTEE,
UNITED STATES REPRESENTATIVE VIRGINIA FOXX OF NORTH CAROLINA.</span><span class='hidden-full-transcript-ellipses'>...</span></p><a href='#' class='hidden-full-transcript-link'><i class='icon-chevron-down'></i> <span class='link-show-full-text'>Show Full Text</span><i class='icon-chevron-up'></i> <span class='link-show-less-text'>Show Less Text</span></a>

<strong>Virginia Foxx</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> REP. FOXX: THANK YOU. THANK YOU, GOVERNOR FALLIN. THE SENATOR HAS BEAUTIFULLY LAID OUT THE VISION OUR PLATFORM PROVIDES. THE REAFFIRMATION OF THE PRINCIPLES<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> AMERICA AND THE
REPUBLICAN PARTY WERE FOUNDED
ON. GOVERNOR FALLIN IS A POWERFUL EXAMPLE OF THE IMPACT VISION CAN HAVE ON ONE INDIVIDUAL WHEN SHE SEARCHED FOR A POLITICAL HOME.
IT HAS BEEN AN HONOR TO SERVE WITH THEM.
WE MUST THANK THE 112 DELEGATES SERVING ON THE PLATFORM COMMITTEE AND THE STAFF AND
VOLUNTEERS FOR THEIR COMMITMENT
TO OUR PRINCIPLES AND UNITING TO ARTICULATE THAT REPUBLICAN VISION INTO A FOCUSED DOCUMENT ANY AMERICAN CAN FIND AGREEMENT
WITH. THEIR WORK IS A TREMENDOUS
EXAMPLE OF INDIVIDUALS EXPRESSING THEMSELVES AS WE THE PEOPLE BY EBINGBEING THE PEOPLE.W E MUST ALL LOOK TO THE WE MUST LOOK AT THE PLATFORM AS
ARE CALLED TO BE THE PEOPLE. THAT IS A CHARGE EXTENDED FROM
THE PLATFORM COMMITTEE TO ALL
DELEGATES HERE. ALL THE REPUBLICANS AND ALL AMERICANS.
RONALD REAGAN ONCE SAID IF NOT OF FOOD, IF NOT NOW, WHEN? THOSE WORDS INSPIRED A
GENERATION OF YOUNG AMERICANS
WHO UNDERSTOOD WHAT REAGAN MEANT.
IF WE ARE TO ENJOY THE BLESSINGS
OF LIBERTY, WE'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR SAFEGUARDING OUR FREEDOMS
AND ADVANCING THEM FOR OTHERS. THAT IS WHY WE MUST AGAIN ANSWER
THAT CALL.
WE THE PEOPLE WILL BE THE PEOPLE.
WE WILL BE THE PEOPLE WHO RESTORES CONSTITUTIONAL GOVERNMENT IN OUR REPUBLIC. WE WILL BE THE PEOPLE WHO GET AMERICA GROWING AND WORKING
AGAIN. WE WILL BE THE PEOPLE WHO BRING
AMERICANS TOGETHER TO RESTORE OUR NATION'S SENSE OF MORAL PURPOSE. OF COURSE, WE WILL BE THE PEOPLE
WHO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN.
[APPLAUSE] IF ANYONE IS WONDERING WHEN, THE ANSWER IS NOW.
[APPLAUSE] OUR PLATFORM IS THE BLUEPRINT TO
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. IN THAT GREATNESS, WE CAN RESTORE AMERICA TO THE MORE PERFECT UNION THAT IS ITS DIVINE CALLING. ALL THAT BEGINS WITH A SIMPLE ACCEPTANCE THAT WE MUST BE THE
PEOPLE. WITH THAT, WE CAN STAY UNITED
AND MOVE FROM THIS PLATFORM, THIS CONVENTION AND HIS CAMPAIGN TO, GOD WILLING, VICTORY IN NOVEMBER. MAY GOD CONTINUE TO BLESS US
ALL.
[APPLAUSE]
>> WE HAVE A MOTION ON THE FLOOR
TO ADOPT THE PLATFORM.
IS THERE A SECOND? ALL THOSE IN FAVOR, PLEASE
SIGNIFY BY SAYING "AYE."</span><span class='hidden-full-transcript-ellipses'>...</span></p><a href='#' class='hidden-full-transcript-link'><i class='icon-chevron-down'></i> <span class='link-show-full-text'>Show Full Text</span><i class='icon-chevron-up'></i> <span class='link-show-less-text'>Show Less Text</span></a>
