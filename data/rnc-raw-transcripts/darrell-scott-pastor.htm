<strong>Darrel C. Scott</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> I FIRST MET DONALD TRUMP
SEVERAL YEARS AGO. IN THAT MEETING HE SAID HE WAS TROUBLED ABOUT THE DIRECTION
THAT OUR COUNTRY IS HEADING.
I LISTEN TO HIS<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> VOICE AND I UNDERSTOOD AND SHARED MANY OF
THE SAME CONCERNS THAT HE
EXPRESSED. IN THE MANY TIMES WE HAVE MET
SINCE, WE HAVE SPOKEN ABOUT THE ECONOMY, RACE RELATIONS, IMMIGRATION, JOBS, URBAN RENOVATION AND REVITALIZATION,
THE MILITARY AND MANY OTHER
ISSUES THAT ARE CRITICAL TO OUR
NATION'S WELL-BEING. THE TRUTH IS, DONALD TRUMP IS A
CONSERVATIVE FATHER AND GRANDFATHER WHO FEELS THAT HIS BEST DAYS ARE IN FRONT OF
HIM, NOT BEHIND HIM.
DESPITE HIS COMPETENCE, -- ACCOMPLISHMENTS, HE STILL FEELS
A VOID THAT CAN ONLY BE FILLED BY SERVICE TO THE COUNTRY AND
SERVICE TO HIS FELLOW AMERICANS.
[CHEERING] THE TRUTH IS THAT THE DEMOCRATIC
PARTY HAS FAILED US. AT HOME, OUR GROWTH IS ATROCIOUS AND OUR DEBT IS DEEPER. WE ARE SPIRITUALLY EMPTY AND WE ARE MORE DIVIDED NOW THAN WE
HAVE EVER BEEN BEFORE.
[CHEERING] ABROAD WE ARE NEITHER RESPECTED, NOT FEARED BY OUR ADVERSARIES
AND OUR FRIENDS CANNOT COUNT ON
US EITHER. THIS IS THEIR LEGACY. WE NEED TO MAKE A SHARP TURN. WE NEED TO PUT INTO PRACTICE THE
GREAT IDEAS AND PRINCIPLES THAT OUR COUNTRY WAS FOUNDED ON AND
WHICH AFTER GOD, THE SORTS OF STRENGTH THAT HAVE MADE THIS
NATION GREAT.
[CHEERING] THIS IS IN OUR BEST INTEREST. IT IS IN THE BEST INTEREST OF
THE WORLD BECAUSE THE GREATER THAT AMERICA IS, THE GREATER THE WORLD BECOMES.
[CHEERING] WHILE SOME PEOPLE MAY CALL, FROM
A POPULIST, I CALL HIM A
PATRIOT. THAT IS BECAUSE BY DEFINITION, A
PATRIOT IS SOMEONE WHO LOVES
THEIR COUNTRY, THAT SUPPORTS IT
AUTHORITY AND PROMOTES ITS
INTEREST. LIBERALS ARE EMBARRASSED TO USE
THIS WORD.
MANY LIBERALS BELIEVE THAT WE
ARE A NATION JUST LIKE ANY
OTHER. BUT WE KNOW THAT WE ARE NOT A NATION JUST LIKE ANY OTHER. WE ARE THE GREATEST NATION IN
THE HISTORY.
[CHEERING] AS REPUBLICANS WE ARE UNRESERVEDLY PROUD TO BE AMERICANS AND WE ARE PROUD OF OUR PATRIOTS. AMERICA IS A MELTING POT. WE ARE A COUNTRY OF DIVERSITY
AND WE STAND POISED TO MAKE HISTORY BY STANDING TOGETHER AS AMERICANS, BY STANDING TOGETHER
AS ONE COUNTRY, ONE NATION UNDER GOD INDIVISIBLE!
[CHEERING] AND WE ARE HERE AS AMERICANS
REGARDLESS OF RACE, BECAUSE OF GREED, REGARDLESS OF COLOR, WE ARE THOSE WHO HOLD THESE TRUTHS
TO BE SELF-EVIDENT THAT ARE ALL
-- ALL MEN ARE TREATED EQUAL AND
ENDOWED BY OUR CREATOR WITH CERTAIN UNALIENABLE RIGHTS AMONG LIFE, LIBERTY AND THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS!
[CHEERING] DONALD TRUMP WILL REBUILD THE
BROKEN TRUST THAT NOW EXIST BETWEEN OUR CITIZENS AND
GOVERNMENT WHICH OVER THE LAST
EIGHT YEARS HAS BROUGHT THE
RHETORIC OF HOPE BUT THROUGHOUT THE OF HIGH MINORITY EMPLOYMENT,
CRIME, DRUG USE, MORE CIVIL
UNREST AND NATIONAL DISTRESS. THIS ELECTION IS THE MOST CRUCIAL ELECTION IN AMERICAN HISTORY.
[CHEERING] LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING,
DONALD TRUMP HAS PLAYED THE BIG
STATE AND IS A MASTER NEGOTIATOR
AND DEALMAKER AND DONALD TRUMP
KNOWS THAT FOR ALL OF THE SHARP ELBOWS AND THE SHARP WORDS AND BRUISED EGOS AND HURT FEELINGS,
THE ART OF THE DEAL IS BRINGING
PEOPLE TOGETHER TO UNIFY AND TO
GET THEM FROM NO TO YES.
[CHEERING] THAT MEANS PROBLEM-SOLVING AND FINDING COMMON GROUND MOVING FORWARD. AND HE NOW WAS TO TAKE THAT
EXPERIENCE TO GET THE BEST DEAL FOR AMERICA AND THE BEST DEAL FOR ALL AMERICANS.
[CHEERING] I BELIEVE, I TRULY BELIEVE THAT
NOTHING WILL PREVENT DONALD TRUMP FROM DOING EVERYTHING IN
HIS POWER TO CREATE AN AMERICA
AND TO BECOME A PRESIDENT THAT
EVERYONE CAN BE PROUD OF.
[CHEERING] AND DONALD TRUMP BELIEVES AS YOU BELIEVE AND I BELIEVE THAT WE CAN BECOME GREAT AGAIN.
[CHEERING] BUT WE CAN ONLY BECOME GREAT AGAIN IF WE HAVE SOME
LEADERSHIP.
[CHEERING] AND I CAN THINK OF NO STRONGER LEADER WILL PLACE THEIR LEFT HAND ON A BIBLE THAT THEY BELIEVE IN, RAISE THEIR RIGHT HAND AND SOLEMNLY SWEAR THAT FAITHFULLY EXECUTE THE OFFICE OF
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
TO THE BEST OF HIS ABILITY,
PRESERVE, PROTECT AND DEFEND THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES THAN DONALD J TRUMP!
[CHEERING]
