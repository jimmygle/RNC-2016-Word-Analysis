<strong>Paul D. Ryan</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> HELLO.
[CHEERING] MY FELLOW REPUBLICANS.
[CHEERING] I COULD NOT BE MORE PROUD OF OUR
VICE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE.
[CHEERING] I SERVED WITH THIS MAN IN<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> THE
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. WE BECAME VERY GOOD FRIENDS. I'VE WATCHED THIS MAN UP CLOSE. I'VE SEEN WHAT HE IS MADE OF. LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING ABOUT MY RENTS, -- MIKE PENCE, THIS IS
A MAN OF SOLID CHARACTER. THIS IS A MAN WHO SEES PUBLIC SERVICE AS A CALLING, NOT A
CAREER. HE HAS SERVED HONORABLY WITH GREAT DIGNITY. YOU KNOW WHAT? THE RESULTS ARE IMPRESSIVE. THIS IS A MAN WHO LED THE CHARGE TO ABANDON YOUR MARKETING
CONGRESS AND HE WON THAT FIGHT.
-- EARMARKS IN CONGRESS AND HE
WON THAT FIGHT.
[CHEERING] AS GOVERNOR OF INDIANA, HE
PASSED THE LARGEST INCOME TAX
CUT IN STATE HISTORY.
[CHEERING] KEEP BALANCED THE STATE BUDGET.
[CHEERING] THIS MAN IS A REAGAN CONSERVATIVE THROUGH AND
THROUGH. PROGROWTH, PRO-LIFE, PRO-STRONG DEFENSE.
[CHEERING] AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, HE IS THE FATHER OF THREE BEAUTIFUL
CHILDREN. MICHAEL, CHARLOTTE AND AUDREY. AND HE CALLS HIS WIFE KAREN THE
BEST PART OF MY LIFE. MY FELLOW REPUBLICANS, THE MAN
THAT YOU HAVE NOMINATED IS A MAN
OF FAITH. A MAN OF CONVICTION. A MAN YOU CAN TRUST. HE COMES FROM THE HEART OF THE CONSERVATIVE MOVEMENT AND FROM
THE HEART OF AMERICA. AND THAT WE NEED TO SEND HIM AN DONALD TRUMP STRAIGHT TO THE
WHITE HOUSE.
[CHEERING] THERE IS NO DOUBT IN MY MIND
THAT HE WILL BRING REAL CHANGE
TO WASHINGTON.
I HAVE EVERY CONFIDENCE THAT HE
WILL DO US PROUD AND SO LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, IT IS MY HONOR TO
INTRODUCE TO YOU THE NEXT AS PRESIDENT -- VICE PRESIDENT OF
THE UNITED STATES, OPENER MIKE
PENCE.

<strong>Mike Pence</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> MR. CHAIRMAN, DELEGATES, FRIENDS AND MY FELLOW AMERICANS,
THANK YOU FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY
HEART. I'M DEEPLY HUMBLED BY YOUR CONFIDENCE AND ON BEHALF<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> OF MY FAMILY HERE AND GONE, I ACCEPT YOUR NOMINATION TO RUN AND SERVE
AS VICE PRESIDENT.
[CHEERING] LET ME THANK SPEAKER PAUL RYAN
FOR THAT GRACIOUS WELCOME. YOU ARE A TRUE FRIEND AND A GREAT AMERICAN LEADER. PAUL KNOWS IT WELL AND HE KNOWS
THE INTRODUCTION I PREFER IS
JUST A LITTLE BIT SHORTER. I'M A CHRISTIAN, A CONSERVATIVE, AND THE REPUBLICAN IN THAT
ORDER.
[CHEERING] YOU KNOW, I'M NEW TO THIS
CAMPAIGN. HONESTLY, I NEVER THOUGHT I
WOULD BE STANDING HERE. I THOUGHT I WOULD BE SPENDING THIS EVENING WITH ALL MY FRIENDS IN THE GREAT STATE OF
INDIANA.
[CHEERING] YET THERE I WAS, A FEW DAYS AGO
IN NEW YORK CITY WITH A MAN WHO
WON 37 STATES WHO FACED 16 TALENTED OPPONENTS AND OUTLASTED
EVERY ONE OF THEM IN ALONG THE WAY ROCK MILLIONS OF NEW VOTERS
INTO THE REPUBLICAN PARTY.
[CHEERING] HE IS A MAN KNOWN FOR A LARGE PERSONALITY, A COLORFUL STYLE
AND LOTS OF CHARISMA. I THINK HE WAS JUST LOOKING FOR
SOME BALANCE ON THE TICKET.
[CHEERING] FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO DON'T KNOW ME, WHICH IS MOST OF YOU, I GREW UP ON THE FRONT ROW OF
THE AMERICAN DREAM. MY GRANDFATHER IMMIGRATED TO
THIS COUNTRY. I WAS RAISED IN A SMALL TOWN IN
SOUTHERN INDIANA IN A BIG FAMILY
WITH A CORNFIELD IN THE BACKYARD. ALTHOUGH WE WEREN'T REALLY A CLINICAL FAMILY, MY HEROES WERE PRESIDENT JOHN F. KENNEDY AND
THE REVEREND DR. MARTIN LUTHER
KING JR.. WHEN I WAS YOUNG, I WATCHED MY
MOM AND DAD BUILD EVERYTHING
THAT MATTERS. THE FAMILY, A BUSINESS, AND A
GOOD NAME. I WAS RAISED TO BELIEVE IN HARD WORK, FAITH, AND FAMILY. MY DAD WAS A COMBAT VETERAN IN
KOREA.
[CHEERING] MY DAD RAN A GAS STATION AND WAS
A GREAT FATHER. IF THAT WERE WITH US TODAY, I
HAVE A FEELING HE WOULD ENJOY THIS MOMENT. AND PROBABLY BE PRETTY SURPRISED.
[LAUGHTER] BUT IT IS SUCH A JOY FOR ME TO TELL YOU THAT MY MOTHER IS HERE.
[CHEERING] WOULD YOU JOIN ME IN WELCOMING THE LIGHT OF MY LIFE, MY MOM, NANCY?
[CHEERING] GROWING UP, ACTUALLY STARTED IN
POLITICS THE OTHER PARTY.
UNTIL I HEARD THE VOICE AND THE
IDEALS OF THE 40TH PRESIDENT AND
I SIGNED ON TO THE REAGAN
REVOLUTION.
[CHEERING] BUT THE BEST THING THAT EVER HAPPENED TO ME, EVEN COUNTING TONIGHT, IS THAT 31 YEARS AGO I
MARRIED THE GIRL OF MY DREAMS, A SCHOOLTEACHER AND ARTIST, SHE IS
EVERYTHING TO ME. WOULD YOU WELCOME MY WONDERFUL WIFE KAREN PENCE?
[CHEERING] AND REGARDLESS OF ANY TITLE I
WILL EVER HOLD, MOST IMPORTANT JOB I WILL EVER HAVE IS SPELLED D-A-D.
[CHEERING] KAREN AND I ARE BLESSED. WE ARE BLESSED TO BE THE PARENTS
OF THE THREE GET HIS KIDS IN THE
WORLD. A WRITER NAMED CHARLIE, A
COLLEGE STUDENT IN AUDREY AND A SECOND LIEUTENANT IN THE UNITED
STATES MARINE CORPS, MICHAEL J SPENCE.
[CHEERING] I'M SO PROUD OF YOU GUYS.
[CHEERING] IF YOU KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT HOOSIERS, YOU KNOW WE LIKE TO
SUIT UP AND COMPETE. WE PLAY TO WIN. THAT IS WHY I JOINED THIS CAMPAIGN IN A HEARTBEAT.
YOU HAVE NOMINATED A MAN FOR
PRESIDENT WHO NEVER QUITS, WHO NEVER BACKS DOWN, A FIGHTER, A WINNER.
UNTIL NOW HE HAS HAD TO DO IT
ALL BY HIMSELF AGAINST ALL ODDS,
BUT THIS WEEK, WITH THIS UNITED PARTY COME ON NOVEMBER 8, I KNOW
WE WILL ELECT DONALD TRUMP TO BE
THE 45TH PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED
STATES OF AMERICA.
[CHEERING] WE WILL WIN BECAUSE WE ARE
RUNNING ON THE ISSUES FACING
THIS COUNTRY. AND BECAUSE WE ARE LEVELING WITH
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ABOUT THE
STAKES AND THE CHOICE. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE TIRED OF BEING TOLD. THEY'RE TIRED OF BEING TOLD THAT THIS IS AS GOOD AS IT GETS. TIRED OF HEARING POLITICIANS IN
BOTH PARTIES TELL US THAT WE
WILL GET TO THAT TOMORROW WHILE WE PILE A MOUNTAIN RANGE OF DEBT
ON OUR CHILDREN AND GRAND
CHILDREN. AS RONALD REAGAN USED TO SAY,
TIRED OF BEING TOLD THAT A LITTLE INTELLECTUAL ELITE CAN PLAN OUR LIVES BETTER THAN WE
CAN PLAN THEM FOR OURSELVES.
[CHEERING] IN THE END, THIS ELECTION COMES
DOWN TO JUST TWO NAMES ON THE BALLOT SO LET'S RESOLVE HERE AND NOW THAT HILLARY CLINTON WILL NEVER BECOME PRESIDENT OF THE
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.
[CHEERING] HILLARY CLINTON ESSENTIALLY OFFERS A THIRD OBAMA TERM. THE ROLE IS PERFECT FOR HER.
SHE CHAMPIONED OBAMACARE BECAUSE YEARS EARLIER SHE HAD ALL BUT
INVENTED IT. THE NATIONAL DEBT IT HAS NEARLY
DOUBLED IN THE EIGHT YEARS AND
HER ONLY ANSWER IS TO KEEP BORROWING AND SPENDING. LIKE THE PRESIDENT, SHE THINKS THE PATH TO EIGHT ROAD ECONOMY
IS MORE TAXES AND MORE REGULATION AND MORE GOVERNMENT.
>> BOO!
>> THEY TELL US THIS ECONOMY IS
THE BEST THAT WE CAN DO. IT IS NOWHERE NEAR THE BEST WE
CAN DO.
IT IS THE BEST THAT THEY CAN DO.
[CHEERING] LET ME TELL YOU, I KNOW
FIRSTHAND, IT DOES NOT LIKE -- HAVE TO BE LIKE THIS.
IN MY HOME STATE OF INDIANA, WE
PROVE EVERY DAY THAT YOU CAN
BUILD A GROWING ECONOMY ON
BALANCED BUDGETS, LOW TAXES EVEN
WHILE MAKING RECORD INVESTMENTS
IN EDUCATION AND ROADS AND
HEALTH CARE.
[CHEERING] YOU KNOW, INDIANA IS A STATE THAT WORKS BECAUSE CONSERVATIVE PRINCIPLES WORK EVERY TIME YOU
PUT THEM INTO PRACTICE.
[CHEERING] TODAY, WHILE THE NATION SUFFERS UNDER THE WEIGHT OF $19 TRILLION, WITH INDIAN HAVE A $2
BILLION SURPLUS. THE HIGHS CREDIT NATION IN THE NATION IN THAT WE HAVE CUT TAXES
EVERY YEAR SINCE I BECAME GOVERNOR FOUR YEARS AGO.
[CHEERING] WE HAVE YOUR STATE EMPLOYEES
THAN WHEN I TOOK OFFICE AND
BUSINESS IS LARGE AND SMALL HAVE CREATED NEARLY 150 -- 150,000
NEW JOBS. THAT IS WHAT YOU CAN DO WITH
COMMONSENSE REPUBLICAN
LEADERSHIP AND THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT THE NO-NONSENSE LEADERSHIP
OF DONALD TRUMP WILL BRING TO BE
WHITE HOUSE.
[CHEERING] DONALD TRUMP GETS IT. HE IS A DOER IN A GAME USUALLY
RESERVED FOR TALKERS. WHEN DONALD TRUMP DOES IS TALKING, HE DOES NOT TIPTOE
AROUND THE THOUSAND NEW RULES OF
POLITICAL CORRECTNESS. HE IS HIS OWN MAN. DISTANTLY AMERICAN. WHERE ELSE WOULD INDEPENDENT
SPIRIT I CAN FIND A FOLLOWING THAN THE LAND OF THE FREE AND THE HOME OF THE BRAVE?
[CHEERING] THE FUNNY THING IS, THE PARTY IN POWER SEEMS HELPLESS TO FIGURE
OUT THE NOMINEE. THE MEDIA HAS THE SAME PROBLEM. THEY ALL KEEP TELLING EACH OTHER
THAT THE USUAL METHODS WILL WORK
AGAINST THEM.
THEY KEEP THINKING THEY HAVE
DONE HIM AND ONLY TO WAKE UP THE NEXT MORNING AND FIND THAT
DONALD TRUMP IS STILL STANDING
AND RUNNING STRONGER THAN EVER
BEFORE. THE MAN JUST DOESN'T QUIT.
[CHEERING] HE IS TOUGH. HE PERSEVERES. HE HAS GONE ABOUT AS FAR AS YOU
CAN GO IN BUSINESS BUT HE HAS NEVER TURNED HIS BACK ON THE WORKING MEN AND WOMEN WHO MAKE
THIS COUNTRY GROW.
[CHEERING] DONALD TRUMP WILL NEVER TURN HIS
BACK ON THOSE WHO SERVE AND PROTECT US AT HOME AND ABROAD.
[CHEERING] IT HAS BEEN A HEARTBREAKING TIME
FOR THE WOMEN AND MEN IN OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT COMMUNITY AND IN
THIS TIME OF -- LET'S LET THEM KNOW HERE AND NOW, ALL ACROSS THIS COUNTRY, WE WILL ALWAYS STAND WITH THOSE WHO STAND ON
THE THIN BLUE LINE OF LAW ENFORCEMENT IN AMERICA.
[CHEERING] NOW, WHILE DONALD TRUMP WAS
TAKING MY EDITOR AS A POSSIBLE
RUNNING MATE, I DID SOME
OBSERVING MYSELF. I HAVE SEEN THE WAY HE DEALS
WITH PEOPLE WHO WORK FOR HIM AT
EVERY LEVEL.
I'VE SEEN THE WAY THEY FEEL
ABOUT WORKING FOR HIM. I GRANT YOU HE CAN BE A LITTLE
ROUGH WITH POLITICIANS ON STAGE
AND I BET WE CAN SEE THAT AGAIN.
[CHEERING] BUT I HAVE SEEN THIS GOOD MAN UP CLOSE, HIS UTTER LACK OF PRETENSE, HIS RESPECT FOR THE
PEOPLE WHO WORK FOR HIM AND HIS
DEVOTION TO HIS FAMILY.
[CHEERING] IF YOU STILL DOUBT WHAT I'M SAYING, AS WE SAY BACK ON, YOU CAN'T FAKE GOOD KIDS. HOW ABOUT HIS AMAZING CHILDREN?
[CHEERING] AREN'T THEY SOMETHING?
[CHEERING] THESE ARE THE TRUE MEASURES OF OUR NOMINEE. CHOSEN BY THE VOTERS AS THE
RIGHT MAN FOR THESE TIMES. THIS IS THE OUTSIDER, MY RUNNING
MATE. TURNED A LONGSHOT CAMPAIGN INTO
A MOVEMENT. OVER IN THE OTHER PARTY, THE
IDEA WAS TO PRESENT THE EXACT
OPPOSITE OF A MEDICAL OUTSIDER,
THE EXACT OPPOSITE OF
CALCULATING TRUTH TELLER, THEN ON THAT SCORE YOU HAVE TO HAND
IT TO THE DEMOCRATIC
ESTABLISHMENT, THEY OUTDID
THEMSELVES THIS TIME.
[CHEERING] AS A VERY MOMENT WHEN AMERICA IS
CRYING OUT FOR SOMETHING NEW AND DIFFERENT, THE OTHER PARTY HAS
ANSWERED WITH A STALE AGENDA AND
THE MOST PREDICTABLE OF NAMES,
PEOPLE IN BOTH PARTIES ARE
RESTLESS FOR CHANGE, READY TO BREAK FREE FROM OLD PATTERNS IN
WASHINGTON AND DEMOCRATS ARE
ABOUT TO ANOINT SOMEONE WHO
REPRESENTS EVERYTHING THIS
COUNTRY IS TIRED OF.
YOU KNOW, HILLARY CLINTON ONCE A BETTER TITLE AND I WOULD TOO IF
I WAS ALREADY AMERICA'S SECRETARY OF THE STATUS QUO.
[CHEERING] THE TOYS COULD NOT BE MORE
CLEAR. AMERICANS CAN ELECT SOMEONE WHO LITERALLY PERSONIFIES THE FAILED ESTABLISHMENT IN WASHINGTON DC
OR WE CAN CHOOSE A LEADER WHO WILL FIGHT EVERY DAY TO MAKE
AMERICA GREAT AGAIN.
[CHEERING] IT IS CHANGE VERSUS STATUS QUO. MY FELLOW REPUBLICANS, WHEN DONALD TRUMP BECOMES PRESIDENT
OF THE UNITED STATES, THE CHANGE
WILL BE HUGE.
[CHEERING] FOR YEARS WE HAVE HAD FUN THAT THE PROBLEMS IN AMERICA THAT
TALKED TO DEATH IN WASHINGTON
DC, BUT THEY NEVER GET SOLVED.
THEY EVEN GET WORSE. WE HAVE SEEN ENTIRE STRETCHES OF
OUR COUNTRY CHRISTIAN OFF NOT
BUY BAD ECONOMIC POLICIES IN
WAYS THAT ARE DEEPLY UNFAIR. WE SEE RELENTLESS MANDATE FROM
THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH. IT SEEMS LIKE NO ASPECT OF OUR
LIVES IS TOO SMALL FOR THE PRESENT ADMINISTRATION TO SUPERVISE AND NO PROVISION OF
THE CONSTITUTION IS TOO LARGE
FOR THEM TO IGNORE.
[CHEERING] MEANWHILE, WE HAVE SEEN BORDERS THAT GO ON RESPECTED, A MILITARY DIMINISHED, PROMISE AFTER
READING PROMISE TO OUR VETERANS
PROBABLY FORGOTTEN. THAT DONALD TRUMP CAME ALONG.
[CHEERING] STARTED SAYING WHAT PRACTICALLY EVERYBODY WAS THINKING ANYWAY. THAT OUR LEADERS NEED TO BE
STRONGER. UNDER DONALD TRUMP, OUR DEALS
WILL BE SMARTER, OUR SOLDIERS WILL HAVE WHAT THEY NEED AND OUR VETERANS WILL HAVE WHAT THEY
AREN'T.
WE WILL SECURE OUR BORDERS TO PROTECT OUR NATION AND WE WILL
BE MORE SERIOUS AND WHEN WE DO,
THIS NATION WILL START RUNNING
AGAIN.
[CHEERING]
-- WINNING AGAIN.
[CHEERING] YOU KNOW, THAT IS THE MESSAGE THAT MEN AND WOMEN OF BOTH
PARTIES HAVE BEEN LONGING TO
HEAR. NONE OF US SHOULD THINK FOR ONE SECOND THAT THIS WILL BE EASY. THE OUTCOME OF THE SELECTION
DEPENDS ON US AND HOW WE CONTEND WITH AN INCREDIBLE ONSLAUGHT THAT IS COMING OUR WAY. THIS WILL NOT BE AMERICA'S FIRST
GLIMPSE AT THE CLINTON MACHINE. AS BERNIE SANDERS CAN TELL YOU. THIS TIME AROUND, SHE WILL HAVE
THE PRESS TO HAVE HER WORK
ORDER.
>> BOO!
>> THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT IT WILL
NOT BE NEARLY ENOUGH.
NOT AGAINST A CANDIDATE WHO
CAPTURES THE ATTENTION OF THE COUNTRY THE WAY DONALD TRUMP HAS.
[CHEERING] ON ISSUE BY ISSUE, HE AND I WILL
TAKE OUR CASE TO THE VOTERS. LOOKING OUT THE FAILURES OF THE OBAMA-CLINTON AGENDA AND SHOWING
A BETTER WAY.
WE WILL WIN THE HEARTS AND MINDS
OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WITH AN AGENDA FOR A STRONGER AND MORE
PROSPEROUS AMERICA.
[CHEERING] NOW, THE ESTABLISHMENT IN
WASHINGTON DC THINKS IT IS ONLY
A NARROW RANGE OF VOTERS WHO ARE
GIVING DONALD TRUMP A SERIOUS LOOK, BUT I CAN TELL YOU FIRSTHAND, THERE ARE A LOT OF AMERICANS WHO FEEL LIKE DEMOCRAT
POLITICIANS HAVE TAKEN THEM FOR
GRANTED. IT IS UNION MEMBERS WHO DON'T
WANT A PRESIDENT WHO PROMISES TO
PUT A LOT OF COAL MINERS AND COAL COMPANIES OUT OF BUSINESS.
[CHEERING] THOSE MINERS WON AN AMERICAN
ENERGY POLICY AND THEY KNOW THAT
DONALD TRUMP DIGS COAL.
[CHEERING] IT IS AFRICAN-AMERICANS WHO REMEMBER GENERATIONS OF HOLLOW
PROMISES ABOUT SAFE STREETS AND
BETTER SCHOOLS AND THEY KNOW
DONALD TRUMP WILL FIGHT FOR EQUAL OPPORTUNITY AND HE LOVES EDUCATIONAL CHOICE.
[CHEERING] IT IS HISPANIC AMERICANS WHO
RESPECT THE LAW, WHAT JOBS AND
OPPORTUNITIES FOR THEIR FAMILIES
WHO KNOW THAT DONALD TRUMP WILL UPHOLD THE LAW AND GET THIS
ECONOMY MOVING FOR EVERY AMERICAN.
[CHEERING] THE PARTY OF LINCOLN WAS FOUNDED
ON EQUALITY AND OPPORTUNITY. DURING THESE DIFFICULT DAYS, IT WILL BE OUR PARTY AND OUR AGENDA THAT OPENS THE DOORS FOR EVERY AMERICAN TO SUCCEED AND PROSPER IN THIS LAND.
[CHEERING] IN SO MANY WAYS, THE DEMOCRATIC
PARTY HAS ABANDONED THOSE IT
USED TO PROTECT. MAYBE THEY HAVE BECOME TOO
ENTRENCHED IN POWER. SO COMFORTABLE AT TIMES THAT THE
LIST PATIENTS WITH THE NORMAL LEGISLATIVE PROCESS. IT IS SO MUCH SIMPLER TO IMPOSE
THEIR VALUES BY EXECUTIVE ORDER
OR COURT ACTION AND MAKE NO
MISTAKE ABOUT IT, HILLARY
CLINTON HAS A BIG IDEAS ALONG
THOSE LINES.
>> BOO!
>> AS THIS ELECTION APPROACHES,
EVERY AMERICAN SHOULD KNOW THAT WHILE WE ARE FILLING THE
PRESIDENCY FOR THE NEXT OR YEARS, THIS ELECTION WILL DEFINE
THE SUPREME COURT FOR THE NEXT
40.
[CHEERING] WE ALL BETTER THINK VERY CAREFULLY, VERY CAREFULLY ABOUT
WHAT THIS MEANS FOR OUR CONSTITUTION AND LIMITED
GOVERNMENT. ELECT HILLARY CLINTON AND YOU
BETTER GET USED TO BEING SUBJECT
TO UNELECTED JUDGES USING UNACCOUNTABLE POWER TO TAKE UNCONSTITUTIONAL ACTIONS. FOR THE SAKE OF THE RULE OF LAW,
FOR THE SAKE OF THE SANCTITY OF LIFE, FOR THE SAKE OF OUR SECOND AMENDMENT, AND FOR THE SAKE OF
ALL OUR OTHER GOD-GIVEN LIBERTIES, WE MUST ENSURE THAT THE NEXT PRESIDENT APPOINTED JUSTICES TO THE SUPREME COURT IS
DONALD TRUMP.
[CHEERING] AND HILLARY CLINTON'S RECORD ON
FOREIGN AFFAIRS IS EVEN WORSE. IT WAS HILLARY CLINTON WHO
HELPED UNDO ALL THE GAINS OF THE TROOP SURGE.
A STAGGERING FAILURE OF JUDGMENT THAT SET ISIS ON THE LOOSE. IT WAS HILLARY CLINTON WHO
INSTIGATED THE PRESIDENT DISASTROUS AGREEMENT WITH THE
RADICAL PEOPLE IN IRAN. IT WAS FULLY CLINTON WHO LEFT AMERICANS AND HARM'S WAY AND
MAKE OZZIE -- BENGHAZI. THEN SHE SAID WHAT DIFFERENCE AT
THIS POINT DOES IT MAKE?
>> BOO!
>> LOCK HER UP! LOCK HER UP! LOCK HER UP! LOCK HER UP!
>> AS THE PROUD FATHER OF A
UNITED STATES MARINE, LET ME SAY
FROM MY HEART, ANYONE WHO SAID
THAT, ANYONE WHO DID THAT SHOULD BE DISQUALIFIED FROM EVER
SERVING AS COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF OF
THE ARMED FORCES OF THE UNITED
STATES OF AMERICA.
[CHEERING] SEVEN HALF YEARS, BARACK OBAMA
AND HILLARY CLINTON POLICIES HAVE WEAKENED AMERICA'S PLACE IN
THE WORLD. TERRORIST ATTACKS AT HOME AND ABROAD, GRIM AND HEARTBREAKING SCENES FROM RENTS JUST A FEW WEEKS AGO -- FRANCE JUST A FEW
WEEKS AGO AND THE ATTEMPTED COUP IN TURKEY TESTAMENT OF A WORLD SPINNING APART. HISTORY TEACHES THAT WEAKNESS AROUSES PEOPLE.
THE CLINTON AND BARACK OBAMA'S FOREIGN POLICY OF LEADING FROM BEHIND, MOVING REDLINES, FEIGNING RESETS WITH RUSSIA AND THE RISE, CRUEL AND REIGN OF
ISIS ARE A TESTAMENT TO THE TRUTH OF HISTORY. WE CANNOT HAVE FOUR MORE YEARS APOLOGIZING TO OUR ENEMIES AND
ABANDONING OUR FRIENDS.
[CHEERING] AMERICA NEEDS TO BE STRONG FOR
THE WORLD TO BE SAFE AND ON THE WORLD STAGE DONALD TRUMP WILL
LEAD FROM STRENGTH.
[CHEERING] DONALD TRUMP WILL REBUILD OUR MILITARY AND STAND WITH OUR
ALLIES. DONALD TRUMP WILL CONFRONT
RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM AT ITS SOURCE AND DESTROY THE ENEMY OF
OUR FREEDOM.
[CHEERING] IF THE WORLD DOES NOTHING ELSE, IT WILL NOTICE, AMERICA STANDS WITH ISRAEL.
[CHEERING] IF YOU LOOK AT THE CALENDAR THIS
MORNING, YOU MAY HAVE NOTICED,
THE PRESIDENCY OF BARACK OBAMA ENDS EXACTLY SIX MONTHS FROM TODAY.
[CHEERING] THIS MUCH IS CERTAIN, THIS MUCH IS CERTAIN OF THE OBAMA YEARS. THEY ARE NOT ENDING WELL. THERE SEEMS TO BE SO MANY THINGS
THAT DIVIDE US, SO FEW GREAT PURPOSES THAT UNITE US AS THEY
ONCE DID. IT IS AT MOMENTS LIKE THIS, MOMENTS WHEN POLITICS FAIL THAT I BELIEVE WE DO WELL TO REMEMBER
THAT WHAT UNITES US FAR EXCEEDS ANYTHING THAT SETS US APART IN AMERICA.
[CHEERING] THAT WE ARE, AS WE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN ONE NATION UNDER GOD INDIVISIBLE WITH LIBERTY AND JUSTICE FOR ALL.
[CHEERING] SHOULD I HAVE THE AWESOME PRIVILEGE TO SERVE AS YOUR VICE PRESIDENT, I PROMISE TO KEEP
FAITH WITH THE CONVICTION. TO PRAY DAILY FOR A WISE AND DISCERNING HEART FOR WHO IS ABLE TO GOVERN THIS GREAT PEOPLE OF YOURS. MY FELLOW AMERICANS, I BELIEVE
WE HAVE COME TO ANOTHER
RENDEZVOUS WITH DESTINY AND I HAVE FAITH, FAITH IN THE BOUNDLESS CAPACITIES OF THE
AMERICAN PEOPLE AND FAITH THAT GOD CAN STILL HEAL OUR LAND.
[CHEERING] BUT WE HAVE A CHOICE TO MAKE. THIS IS ANOTHER TIME FOR
CHOOSING. IF YOU WANT A PRESIDENT WHO WILL
PROTECT THIS NATION, CONFRONT RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM AND RID THE WORLD OF ISIS, IF YOU WANT A PRESIDENT WHO WILL
RESTORE LAW AND ORDER TO THIS COUNTRY AND GIVE LAW ENFORCEMENT THE SUPPORT AND RESOURCES THEY
DESERVE, IF YOU WANT A PRESIDENT WHO WILL CUT TAXES, GROW OUR
ECONOMY AND SQUEEZE EVERY NICKEL
OUT OF THE FEDERAL ROCKER C -- BUREAUCRACY, IF YOU WANT A
PRESIDENT WHO WILL BUILD STRONG BORDERS AND ENFORCE OUR LAWS, AND IF YOU WANT A PRESIDENT WHO
WILL UP AND THE STATUS QUO IN WASHINGTON DC AND APPOINT
JUSTICES TO THE SUPREME COURT
WILL UPHOLD THE CONSTITUTION, WE
HAVE BUT ONE CHOICE AND THAT MAN
IS READY.
THIS TEAM IS READY. OUR PARTY IS READY AND WHEN WE
ELECT DONALD TRUMP THE 45TH
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES,
TOGETHER WE WILL MAKE AMERICA
GREAT AGAIN.
[CHEERING] THANK YOU. AND GOD BLESS YOU AND GOD BLESS
THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA!
