<strong>Ivanka Trump</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> GOOD EVENING.
[CHEERING] THANK YOU. ONE YEAR AGO I ENTERED IS MY FATHER WHEN HE DECLARED HIS
CANDIDACY. IN HIS OWN WAY ANSWER HIS OWN SHEER FORCE OF<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> WILL, HE SACRIFICED GREATLY TO ENTER THE POLITICAL ARENA AS AN OUTSIDER.
AND HE PREVAILED AGAINST A FIELD OF 16 VERY TALENTED COMPETITORS.
[CHEERING] FOR MORE THAN A YEAR, DONALD
TRUMP HAS BEEN THE PEOPLE'S
CHAMPION. AND TONIGHT, HE IS THE PEOPLE'S
NOMINEE.
[CHEERING] LIKE MANY OF MY FELLOW
MILLENNIALS, I DO NOT CONSIDER MYSELF CATEGORICALLY REPUBLICAN
OR DEMOCRAT. MORE THAN PARTY, I VOTE BASED ON
WHAT I BELIEVE IS RIGHT FOR MY
FAMILY AND MY COUNTRY. SOMETIMES IT IS A TOUGH CHOICE. THAT IS NOT THE CASE THIS TIME. A PROUD DAUGHTER OF YOUR
NOMINEE, I'M HERE TO TELL YOU
THAT THIS IS A MOMENT AND DONALD
TRUMP IS THE PERSON TO MAKE
AMERICA GREAT AGAIN.
[CHEERING] REAL CHANGE, THE KINDLY IN A DECADES IS ONLY GOING TO COME FROM OUTSIDE THE SYSTEM AND IT
IS ONLY GOING TO COME FROM A MAN
WHO IS SPENT HIS ENTIRE LIFE
DOING WHAT OTHERS SAID CANNOT BE DONE. MY FATHER IS A FIGHTER. WHEN THE PRIMARIES GOT TOUGH,
AND THEY WERE TOP, HE DID WHAT ANY GREAT LEADER DOES, HE DUG DEEPER, WORKED HARDER, GOT BETTER AND BECAME STRONGER.
[CHEERING] I HAVE SEEN HIM FIGHT FOR HIS
FAMILY. I HAVE SEEN HIM FIGHT FOR HIS
EMPLOYEES. I HAVE SEEN HIM FIGHT FOR HIS COMPANY AND NOW I AM SEEING HIM
FIGHT FOR OUR COUNTRY.
[CHEERING] IT IS THE STORY OF HIS LIFE AND
MORE RECENTLY, THE SPIRIT OF HIS
CAMPAIGN.
IT IS ALSO A PRELUDE TO REACHING
THE GOAL THAT UNITES US ALL. WHEN -- THIS PARTY AND BETTER
STILL THIS COUNTRY KNOWS WHAT IT
IS LIKE TO WIN AGAIN.
[CHEERING] POSSIBLE TO BE FAMOUS AND NOT WELL KNOWN, THAT DESCRIBES THE
FATHER WHO RAISED ME. IN THE SAME OFFICE OF TRUCK TIRE WHERE WE -- TRUMP TOWER WHERE WE
WORK TOGETHER, REPLAY AND ON THE
FOR NEXT MY FATHER'S DESK CONSTRUCTING MINIATURE BUILDINGS WITH LEGOS WHILE HE DID THE SAME WITH CONCRETE, STEEL AND GLASS. MY FATHER TAUGHT MY SIBLINGS AND ME THE IMPORTANCE OF POSITIVE
VALUES IN A STRONG ETHICAL
COMPASS. HE SHOWED US HOW TO BE
RESILIENT, HOW TO DEAL WITH CHALLENGES AND HOW TO STRIVE FOR
EXCELLENCE IN ALL THAT WE DO.
HE TAUGHT US THAT THERE IS
NOTHING WE CANNOT ACCOMPLISH IF
WE MARRIED VISION AND PASSION
WITH AN ENDURING WORK ETHIC.
[CHEERING] ONE OF MY FATHER'S GREATEST
TALENTS IS HIS ABILITY TO SEE POTENTIAL IN PEOPLE BEFORE THEY SEATED HIMSELF -- THEMSELVES.
HE TAUGHT US THAT POTENTIAL
MANAGERS INTO NOTHING WITHOUT
EFFORT. AND THAT LIKE HIM, WE EACH HAD A RESPONSIBILITY TO WORK NOT JUST
FOR OURSELVES, BUT FOR THE BETTERMENT OF THE WORLD AROUND US.
[CHEERING] OVER THE YEARS, ON TOO MANY
OCCASIONS TO COME, I SAW MY FATHER CARE STORIES OUT OF THE
NEWSPAPER ABOUT PEOPLE AND HE HAD NEVER MET WERE FACING INJUSTICE OR HARDSHIP. WROTE A NOTE TO HIS ASSISTANT
AND A SIGNATURE PEN AND
REQUESTED THAT THE PERSON BE FOUND AND INVITED TO COME POWER TO MEET WITH HIM.
HE WOULD TALK TO THEM AND DRAW A POUND -- UPON HIS EXTENSIVE NETWORKING ON THEM A JOB OR GET A BREAK.
THEY WOULD LEAVE HIS OFFICE AS
PEOPLE SO OFTEN DO AFTER HAVING BEEN WITH DONALD TRUMP FEELING THAT LIFE COULD BE GREAT AGAIN. THROUGHOUT MY ENTIRE LIFE, EYEWITNESSES EMPATHY AND
GENEROSITY TOWARDS OTHER,
ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO ARE
SUFFERING.
IT IS JUST HIS WAY OF BEING IN
YOUR CORNER WHEN YOU ARE DOWN. MY FATHER NOT ONLY HAS THE STRENGTH AND ABILITY NECESSARY TO BE THE NEXT PRESIDENT, BUT ALSO THE KINDNESS AND COMPASSION THAT WILL ENABLE HIM TO BE THE
LEADER THAT THIS COUNTRY NEEDS.
[CHEERING] MY FATHER HAS A SENSE OF FAIRNESS THAT TOUCHES EVERY CONVICTION HE HOLDS.
I WORKED ALONGSIDE HIM FOR MORE
THAN A DECADE NOW AT THE TRUMP
ORGANIZATION I HAVE SEEN HOW HE
OPERATES AS A LEADER MAKING IMPORTANT DECISIONS THAT SHAPE CAREERS AND CHANGE LIVES. I HAVE LEARNED A LOT ABOUT THE
WORLD FROM WALKING CONSTRUCTION JOBS DOWN BY HIS SIDE. WHEN RUN PROPERLY, CONSTRUCTION SITES ARE TRUE MERITOCRACY. COMPETENCE IN THE BUILDING TRADE
IS EASY TO SPOT AND INCOMPETENCE IS IMPOSSIBLE TO HIDE.
[CHEERING] THESE SITES ARE ALSO INCREDIBLE MELTING POTS GATHERING PEOPLE
FROM ALL WALKS OF LIFE AND UNITING THEM TO WORK TOWARDS A
SINGLE MISSION. THERE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN MEN OF
ALL BACKGROUNDS AND ETHNICITIES ON MY FATHER'S JOB SITES AND LONG BEFORE IT WAS COMMONPLACE HE ALSO SAW WOMEN.
[CHEERING] MY FATHER VALUES TALENT.
HE RECOGNIZES REAL KNOWLEDGE AND
SKILL WHEN HE FINDS IT.
HE IS COLORBLIND AND GENDER-NEUTRAL.
[CHEERING] HE HAS THE BEST PERSON FOR THE JOB.
. WORDS AND PROMISES, THE MATTER
HOW VISIONARY THEY SOUND WILL
ONLY GET YOU SO FAR. IN OUR VISION, YOU ARE NOT A BUILDER UNLESS YOU HAVE A
BUILDING TO SHOW FOR IT.
OR IN MY FATHER'S CASE, CITY SKYLINE'S.
[CHEERING] MOST PEOPLE STRIVE THEIR ENTIRE
LIVES TO ACHIEVE GREAT SUCCESS
IN A SINGLE INDUSTRY. MY FATHER HAS SUCCEEDED IN MANY
ON THE HIGHEST LEVEL AND ON A GLOBAL SCALE. ONE OF THE REASONS HE STRIVES AS AN ENTREPRENEUR IS BECAUSE HE LISTENS TO EVERYONE. BILLIONAIRE EXECUTIVES DON'T
USUALLY ASK THE PEOPLE DOING THE
WORK FOR THEIR OPINIONS OF THE
WORK. MY FATHER IS AN EXCEPTION. ON EVERY ONE OF HIS PROJECTS YOU
WILL SEE HIM TALKING TO THE
SUPER, THE PAINTER, THE ELECTRICIAN, HE WILL ASK THEM
FOR THEIR FEEDBACK. IF THEY THINK SOMETHING SHOULD BE DONE DIFFERENTLY OR COULD BE DONE BETTER.
ONE DONALD TRUMP IS IN CHARGE HIM ALL THAT COUNTS HIS ABILITY, EFFORT AND EXCELLENCE.
[CHEERING] THIS HAS LONG BEEN THE PHILOSOPHY OF THE TRUMP
ORGANIZATION. MY FATHER'S COMPANY, THERE ARE
MORE FEMALE THAN MALE EXECUTIVES. WOMEN ARE PAID EQUALLY FOR THE
WORK THAT WE DO AND WHEN A WOMAN
BECOMES A MOTHER SHE IS SUPPORTED, NOT SHUT OUT.
[CHEERING] WOMEN REPRESENT 46% OF THE TOTAL U.S. LABOR FORCE AND 40% OF
AMERICAN HOUSEHOLDS HAVE FEMALE
PRIMARY BREADWINNERS. IN 2014, WOMEN MADE $.83 FOR
EVERY DOLLAR EARNED BY A MAN. SINGLE WOMEN WITHOUT CHILDREN EARNED $.94 WHEREAS MARRIED MOTHERS MADE ONLY $.77. AS RESEARCHERS HAVE NOTED,
GENDER IS NO LONGER A FACTOR CREATING THE GREATEST WAGE DISCREPANCY, MOTHERHOOD IS. AS PRESIDENT, MY FATHER WILL CHANGE THE LABOR LAWS THAT WERE PUT IN PLACE AT A TIME WHEN
WOMEN WERE UP A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE WORKFORCE. HE WILL FOCUS ON MAKING QUALITY
CHILD CARE AFFORDABLE AND ACCESSIBLE FOR ALL.
[CHEERING] AS A MOTHER MYSELF OF THREE
YOUNG CHILDREN, I KNOW HOW HARD
IT IS TO WORK WHILE RAISING A
FAMILY.
I ALSO KNOW THAT I'M FAR MORE
FORTUNATE THAN MOST. AMERICAN FAMILIES NEEDED RELIEF. POLICIES THAT ALLOW WOMEN WITH
CHILDREN TO THRIVE SHOULD NOT BE NOVELTIES, THEY SHOULD BE THE
NORM. POLITICIANS TALK ABOUT WAGE EQUALITY, BUT MY FATHER HAS MADE
IT A PRACTICE AT HIS COMPANY THROUGHOUT HIS ENTIRE CAREER.
[CHEERING] HE WILL FIGHT FOR EQUAL PAY,
EQUAL WORK AND I WILL FIGHT FOR THIS RIGHT ALONGSIDE OF HIM.
[CHEERING]
>> TRUMP, TRUMP, TRUMP!
>> AMERICANS TODAY NEED AN
ECONOMY THAT PERMITS PEOPLE TO
RISE AGAIN. A TRUMP PRESIDENCY WILL TURN THE ECONOMY AROUND AND RESTORE THE GREAT AMERICAN TRADITION OF
GIVING EACH NEW GENERATION HOPE FOR BRIGHTER OPPORTUNITIES AND
THOSE OF THE GENERATION THAT
CAME BEFORE. AND DONALD TRUMP, YOU HAVE A CANDIDATE WHO KNOWS THE
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WANTING SOMETHING DONE AND MAKING IT
HAPPEN.
[CHEERING] WHEN MY FATHER SAYS THAT HE WILL
BUILD A TOWER, KEEP AN EYE ON THE SKYLINE. 4 X 4, A SOARING STRUCTURE WILL
APPEAR, USUALLY RECORD SETTING AND ICONIC IN ITS DESIGN. REAL PEOPLE ARE HIRED TO DO REAL
WORK.
VISION BECOMES REALITY. WHEN MY FATHER SAID THAT HE WILL
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, HE WILL DELIVER.
[CHEERING] WE HAVE A CHANCE THIS YEAR TO
RECLAIM OUR HERITAGE OF THE
COUNTRY THAT CARRIES BIG AND
MAKES THE IMPOSSIBLE HAPPENED. FORTUNATELY, DONALD TRUMP IS
INCAPABLE OF THINKING SMALL. WHEN I WAS A CHILD, MY FATHER
ALWAYS TOLD ME, IF YOU'RE GOING
TO BE THINKING ANYWAY, YOU MIGHT
AS WELL THINK BIG. AS PRESIDENT, MY FATHER WILL TAKE ON THE BOLD AND WORTHY
FIGHT.
HE WILL BE UNAFRAID TO SET LOFTY
GOALS AND HE WILL BE RELENTLESS
IN HIS DETERMINATION TO ACHIEVE THEM. TO PEOPLE ALL OVER AMERICA, I SAID, WHEN YOU HAVE MY FATHER AND YOUR CORNER, YOU WILL NEVER AGAIN HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT BEING
LET DOWN.
HE WILL FIGHT FOR YOU ALL THE
TIME, ALL THE WAY, EVERY TIME.
[CHEERING] MAYBE IT IS THE DEVELOPER AND
HIM, BUT DONALD TRUMP CANNOT
STAND TO SEE EMPTY MAIN STREET
AND BOARDED UP FACTORIES. HE CAN'T BEAR THE INJUSTICE OF
COLLEGE GRADUATES WHO ARE
CRIPPLED BY STUDENT DEBT AND
MOTHERS WHO CAN'T AFFORD THE
COST OF CHILDCARE, REQUIRED TO RETURN TO WORK.
[CHEERING] OTHERS SEE THE HARDSHIPS OF THE
UNFAIRNESS AND SAY THEY FEEL FOR
YOU. ONLY MY FATHER WILL SAY, I WILL FIGHT FOR YOU.
[CHEERING] THE HARD-WORKING MEN AND WOMEN
OF THIS COUNTRY IDENTIFY WITH MY
FATHER.
HE IS TOUGH AND HIS PERSEVERING.
HIS HONEST AND REAL. HE IS AN OPTIMIST AND HE IS A RELENTLESS BELIEVER IN AMERICA AND ALL OF HER POTENTIAL. HE LOVES HIS FAMILY AND HE LOVES
HIS COUNTRY WITH HIS HEART AND
HIS SOUL. POLITICIANS ASK TO BE JUDGED BY
THEIR PROMISES, NOT THE RESULTS, I ASK YOU TO JUDGE MY FATHER BY HIS RESULTS.
JUDGES BODIES BY THOSE HE HAS
INSTILLED IN HIS CHILDREN. JUDGES COMPETENCY BY THE POWERS
HE HAS BUILT. THE COMPANIES HE FOUNDED AND THE
TENS OF THOUSANDS OF JOBS HE HAS
CREATED. HE IS THE SINGLE MOST QUALIFIED
PERSON TO SERVE AS CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF AN TRILLION DOLLAR
ECONOMY.
-- $18 TRILLION ECONOMY. MY FATHER WILL CALL UPON THE
BEST AND BRIGHTEST PEOPLE FROM ALL SPHERES OF INDUSTRY AND BOTH
SIDES OF THE AISLE. A NEW SET OF THINKERS TO FACE
OUR COUNTRY'S EXISTING AND
FUTURE PROBLEMS WITH FRESH PERSPECTIVE AND BRAVE, NEW
SOLUTIONS. COME JANUARY 17, ALL THINGS WILL BE POSSIBLE AGAIN. WE CAN HOPE AND DREAM AND THINK
BIG AGAIN. NO ONE HAS MORE FAITH IN THE AMERICAN PEOPLE BEEN MY FATHER. HE WILL BE YOUR GREATEST,
TRUEST, MOST LOYAL CHAMPION.
[CHEERING] THIS IS THE FIGHTER, THE VIEWER
YOU HAVE CHOSEN AS YOUR NOMINEE IN WAYS NO ONE EXPECTED. THIS MOMENT IN THE LIFE OF OUR
COUNTRY HAS DEFINED THE MISSION
AND GIVEN IT TO EXTORT A MAN.
HE IS READY TO SEE IT ALL -- EXTRAORDINARY MAN. READY TO SEE IT ALL THE WAY
THROUGH. SPEAK EVERY MAN AND EVERY WOMAN
OF EVERY BACKGROUND IN EVERY
PART OF THIS COUNTRY. TO EARN YOUR TRUST AND YOUR
BOAT. THAT AND MUCH MORE FROM THE A
LONG TIME AGO, I HAVE LOVED AND RESPECTED HIM MY ENTIRE LIFE AND I COULD NOT BE MORE PROUD TONIGHT TO PRESENT TO YOU AND TO ALL OF AMERICA MY FATHER AND OUR NEXT PRESIDENT, DONALD J TRUMP.
