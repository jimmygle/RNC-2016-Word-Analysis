<strong>Peter A. Thiel</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> GOOD EVENING.
I BUILD COMPANY SPIRIT I SUPPORT
PEOPLE BUILDING THINGS.
I'M NOT A POLITICIAN. BUT NEITHER IS DONALD TRUMP. HE IS A BUILDER AND IT IS<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> TIME TO REBUILD AMERICA.
[CHEERING] WHERE I WORK IN SILICON VALLEY,
IT IS HARD TO SEE WHERE AMERICA HAS GONE WRONG. MY INDUSTRY HAS MADE A LOT OF
PROGRESS IN COMPUTERS, SOFTWARE AND OF COURSE IT HAS MADE A LOT
OF MONEY. BUT SILICON VALLEY IS A SMALL
PLACE. DRIVE OUT TO SACRAMENTO OR EVEN
ACROSS THE BRIDGE TO OAKLAND AND YOU WILL NOT SEE THE SAME PROSPERITY. THAT IS JUST HOW SMALL IT IS. ACROSS THE COUNTRY, WAGES ARE
FLAT. AMERICANS GET PAID LESS TODAY THAN 10 YEARS AGO. BUT HEALTH CARE AND COLLEGE
TUITION COSTS MORE EVERY YEAR. MEANWHILE, WALL STREET BANKERS INFLATE BUBBLES IN EVERYTHING
FROM GOVERNMENT BONDS HILLARY CLINTON SPEAKING FEES.
[CHEERING] OUR ECONOMY IS BROKEN.
IF YOU ARE WATCHING ME RIGHT
NOW, YOU UNDERSTAND THIS AT HER
THAN ANY POLITICIAN IN
WASHINGTON DC. AND YOU KNOW THIS IS NOT THE DREAM WE LOOK FORWARD TO. BACK WHEN MY PARENTS CAME TO AMERICA LOOKING FOR THAT DREAM,
THEY FOUND IT RIGHT HERE IN
CLEVELAND.
[CHEERING] THEY BROUGHT ME HERE AS A ONE-YEAR-OLD AND THIS IS WHERE I
BECAME AN AMERICAN. OPPORTUNITY WAS EVERYWHERE. MY DATA STUDIED ENGINEERING AT
CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY. JUST DOWN THE ROAD FROM WHERE WE
ARE NOW. IN 1968, THE WORLD HIGH-TECH
CAPITAL WAS NOT JUST ONE CITY,
ALL OF AMERICA WAS HIGH-TECH. IT IS HARD TO REMEMBER THIS, BUT
OUR GOVERNMENT WAS ONCE HIGH-TECH TOO.WHEN I MOVED IT CLEVELAND, DEFENSE RESEARCH WAS
LAYING THE FOUNDATIONS FOR THE
INTERNET. THE APOLLO PROGRAM WAS JUST ABOUT TO PUT A MAN ON THE MOON. AND IT WAS THE ARMSTRONG FROM
RIGHT HERE IN OHIO -- NEIL ARMSTRONG FROM RIGHT HERE IN
OHIO. TODAY OUR GOVERNMENT IS BROKEN. OUR NUCLEAR BASES STILL USE
FLOPPY DISKS.
OUR NEWEST FIGHTER JET CAN'T EVEN FLY IN THE RING.
-- RAIN AND IT WOULD BE. KINDEST IN THE GOVERNMENT SOFTWARE WORKS POORLY BECAUSE
MUCH OF THE TIME IT DOES NOT
EVEN WORK AT ALL. THAT IS A STAGGERING DECLINE FOR
THE COUNTRY THAT COMPLETED THE MANHATTAN PROJECT.
WE DON'T ACCEPT SUCH
INCOMPETENCE IN SILICON VALLEY
AND WE MUST NOT ACCEPT IT FROM
OUR GOVERNMENT.
[CHEERING] INSTEAD OF GOING TO MARS, WE
HAVE INVADED THE MIDDLE EAST. WE DON'T NEED TO SEE HELLER CLINTON DELETED E-MAILS, HER COMPETENCE IS IN PLAIN SIGHT.
-- INCOMPETENCE IS IN PLAIN
SIGHT.
[CHEERING] SHE PUSHED FOR A WAR IN LIBYA AND TODAY IT IS A TRAINING GROUND FOR ISIS. ON THIS MOST IMPORTANT ISSUE,
DONALD TRUMP IS RIGHT. IT IS TIME TO END THE ERA OF
STUPID WARS AND REBUILD OUR COUNTRY.
[CHEERING] WHEN I WAS A KID, THE GREAT
DEBATE WAS ABOUT HOW TO DEFEAT
THE SOVIET UNION.
AND WE WON. NOW WE ARE TOLD THAT THE GREAT
DEBATE IS ABOUT WHO GETS TO USE
WHICH BATHROOM. THIS IS A DISTRACTION FROM OUR
REAL PROBLEMS. WHO CARES?
[CHEERING] OF COURSE, EVERY AMERICAN HAS A
UNIQUE IDENTITY.
I AM PROUD TO BE GAY. I'M PROUD TO BE A REPUBLICAN.
[CHEERING] MOST OF ALL, I'M PROUD TO BE AN AMERICAN.
[CHEERING] I DON'T PRETEND TO AGREE WITH
EVERY PLANK IN OUR PARTY PLATFORM, BUT STATE CULTURE WARS ONLY DISTRACT US FROM OUR
ECONOMIC DECLINE. NOBODY IN THIS RACE IS BEING HONEST ABOUT IT EXCEPT DONALD TRUMP.
[CHEERING] WHILE IT IS FITTING TO TALK ABOUT WHO WE ARE, TODAY IT IS
MORE IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER WHERE
WE CAME FROM.
FOR ME THAT IT'S CLEVELAND. THE BRIGHT FUTURE AS PROMISED. WHEN DONALD TRUMP ASKS US TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, HE IS
NOT SUGGESTING A RETURN TO THE
PAST. HE IS RUNNING TO LEAD US BACK TO
THE BRIGHT FUTURE. TONIGHT, I URGE ALL OF MY FELLOW
AMERICANS TO STAND UP AND VOTE
FOR DONALD TRUMP.
[CHEERING] THANK YOU.</span><span class='hidden-full-transcript-ellipses'>...</span></p><a href='#' class='hidden-full-transcript-link'><i class='icon-chevron-down'></i> <span class='link-show-full-text'>Show Full Text</span><i class='icon-chevron-up'></i> <span class='link-show-less-text'>Show Less Text</span></a>

<strong>Unidentified Speaker</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> MY GRANDFATHER ALWAYS SAID,
THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IN LIFE
IS TO LOVE WHAT YOU ARE DOING BECAUSE THAT IS THE ONLY WAY HE WILL EVER BE GOOD AT IT.<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> MY GRANDFATHER WAS FIERCELY
AMBITIOUS. A WORKAHOLIC.
HE MADE MY FATHER AND HIS SIBLINGS WATCH HIM AS HE WORKED CONSTRUCTION SITES.
THAT IS HOW WE TALK TO HIM. MY FATHER CARRIED A PASSION FOR LEARNING TO THE WHARTON SCHOOL
OF FINANCE. WHEN HE GRADUATED, HE SET HIS SIGHTS ON MANHATTAN.
MY GRANDFATHER CANNOT UNDERSTAND
WHY. HE HAD BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN
BROOKLYN AND QUEENS AND THOUGHT
MY FATHER SHOULD FOLLOW IN HIS
FOOTSTEPS.
TO MY FATHER, MANHATTAN WAS THE
EPICENTER OF THE WORLD.
IT WAS CENTER STAGE. IT WAS WHERE HE WANTED TO MAKE
HIS NAME. WHEN I FATHER FIRST LAID EYES ON
THE COMMODORE HOTEL IN THE HEART
OF NEW YORK CITY, AT 42ND STREET
NEXT TO GRAND CENTRAL STATION, HE KNEW THE RUNDOWN PROPERTY HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO BE A CROWN JEWEL. THE TURNING POINT CAME WHEN MY
FATHER DECIDED TO PURCHASE THE
GREATEST SINGLE PIECE OF REAL
ESTATE IN HER CITY. WORKING FROM HIS APARTMENT EVERY
DAY, HE WOULD PASS AN 11 STORY
BUILDING AT THE CORNER OF 57 STREET AND -- IT WOULD TO BECOME THE ICONIC TRUMP TOWER. TIMING IS EVERYTHING. IN 1982, HE UNVEILED THE $209 58
STORY APARTMENT RETAIL TOPICS. IT WAS THE CORNERSTONE OF MY
FATHER'S GLOBAL AND -- PLAN. TRUMP INTERNATIONAL HOTEL AND TOWER, TRUMP SOHO, MARA LAGO, THE POST OFFICE, MY FATHER HAS
BOTH AN ACQUIRED PROPERTIES ALL
OVER THE WORLD.
SCOTLAND, DUBAI, CANADA, PENAMA,
BRAZIL.
EVERYTHING MY BROTHER DOES -- FATHER DOES IS FIRST CLASS. HE LOVES BUILDING THE GREATEST
PROJECTS IN THE WORLD.
AND YOU LOVE WHAT YOU DO, YOU
APPARENTLY DO IT BETTER. IT DOES NOT FEEL LIKE WORK. HIS PASSION IS CONTAGIOUS AND IT
MOTIVATES PEOPLE AROUND HIM.
WHEN MY FATHER'S PROUDEST ACCOMPLISHMENTS WITH THEM A
GRANDFATHER LIVED TO WITNESS THE
ROOT OF HIS SUCCESS.
HE LIVED TO SEE OUR NAME
TRANSFORMED. SINCE THEN, NOT A DAY GOES BY
THAT MY FATHER DOES NOT WISH MY
GRANDFATHER WAS HERE TO SEE THE BRAND RISE TO GLOBAL EXCELLENCE.
DOMINATED THE WORLD OF LUXURY
HOTELS. OMITTING THE WORLD OF GOLF AND
NOW, THE WORLD OF POLITICS. MY GRANDFATHER WAS A PATRIOTIC AMERICAN. I KNOW HE WOULD GET A KICK OUT
OF SEEING HIS SON EXCEPT THE
REPUBLICAN NOMINATION FOR
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. NOT PEOPLE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK ALONGSIDE THEIR CHILDREN.
BUT MY FATHER HAS BEEN BLESSED
TO NOT ONLY FOR US, BUT TO ALSO TEACH US WHAT MY GRANDFATHER HAD
TAUGHT HIM. AND NOW, AS HE TAKES THE
GREATEST UP IN HIS LIFE, ALL
THAT HE HAS WORKED FOR SO HARD WILL BE IN VERY CAPABLE HANDS
WITH US. MY FATHER STRUCK A NERVE WITH
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. PEOPLE WHO NEVER CARED ABOUT THE ELECTION OR VOTED BEFORE, RUSHING TO HIS RALLIES, SUCCESS
HAS TAUGHT MY FATHER THAT ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE. EVEN WHERE OTHERS HAVE FAILED, HIS VISION CAN PROSPER. AMERICA HAS BEEN MY FATHER EVERYTHING COMING KERNEL FAMILY,
SUCCESSFUL COMPANY, AND THE
ABILITY TO EMPLOY THOUSANDS OF
HARD-WORKING PEOPLE EVERY DAY. AS PRESIDENT, MY FATHER PAYS TO
KEEP MAKING DEALS COME UP DEALS
ON BEHALF OF THIS COUNTRY.
AROUND THE CLOCK.
IT IS TIME FOR MY FATHER TO USE ALL THAT LIFE HAS TAUGHT HIM TO
BRING OUR COUNTRY ACT -- BACK.
