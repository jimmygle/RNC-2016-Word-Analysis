<p class='short_transcript'> >> HEAVENLY FATHER, WE ASK THAT YOU BLESS AND INSPIRED THESE DELEGATES, THAT THE
DELIBERATIONS OVER THE NEXT OR DAYS MIGHT BE EARNEST AND FRUITFUL. OUR<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> FOREFATHERS RECOGNIZED IN
YOUR DIVINE PLAN THE FREEDOM YOU INTENDED FOR ALL MEN AND WOMEN. WE STAND BEFORE YOU CONTRITE FOR
THOSE TIMES IN OUR HISTORY WHERE
WE FAILED TO BE THE SHINING CITY ON THE HILL FOR WHICH YOU
DESTINED OUR GREAT LAND. WE HUMBLY GIVE YOU THANKS, MOST ESPECIALLY FOR THOSE WHO BRAVELY
WEAR THE UNIFORM HERE AT HOME
AND ABROAD. TRULY THERE IS NO GREATER LOVE
THAN TO LAY DOWN ONE'S LIFE FOR A FRIEND. BLESS THOSE WHO ENDURED TORTURE OR START REVISED -- SACRIFICE THEMSELVES FOR THE FREEDOM OF OUR FELLOW COUNTRYMEN AND THOSE
IN FAR-FLUNG PLACES AROUND THE
WORLD. INSPIRE US TO BUILD A MORE NOBLE SOCIETY THAT REFLECTS YOUR
DIVINE IMAGE TO A WORLD THAT IS BROKEN AND ROCK LOW BISON -- BRO
UGHT LOW BY SIN. YOU HAVE ENDOWED US WITH A GIFT OF CHARITY, MAY WE BE MINDFUL OF
THOSE WHO SUFFER HERE AND
ABROAD. FATHER, WE KNOW THAT OUR TRUE CITIZENSHIP IS IN YOUR KINGDOM.
YOU REMIND US THAT TO INHERIT
INHERIT LIFE -- ETERNAL LIFE, WE
MUST LOVE YOUR LORD WITH ALL OUR
HEART AND ALL YOUR MIND AND STRENGTH AND SOUL, LOVE YOUR
NEIGHBOR AS YOURSELF. YOUR SON INSTRUCTS US WITH THE
PARABLE OF THE GOOD SAMARITAN AS
TO WHO IS OUR NEIGHBOR.
MAY WE DEFEND LIFE WHEN MOST
HONORABLE IN THE WOMB OR AN OLD AGE. LET US NOT FORGET OUR OBLIGATION TO THE POOR AND THE SICK, THE PRISONER AND THE ALIEN IN OUR MIDST, WE MAKE THIS PRAYER
THROUGH YOUR HOLY NAME, AMEN.
