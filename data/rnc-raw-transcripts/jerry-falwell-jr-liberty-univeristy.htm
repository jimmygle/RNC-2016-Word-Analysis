<strong>Jerry Falwell Jr.</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> I'M SO HONORED AND HUMBLED TO
BE HERE TONIGHT. IN 1984, A FATHER STOOD AT THIS CONVENTION AND OFFERED THE OPENING PRAYER BEFORE OUR PARTY'S CANDIDATE,<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> RONALD REAGAN
, WENT ON TO ACCEPT THE NOMINATION AND WIN IN A
LANDSLIDE.
[CHEERING] A LITTLE OVER 30 YEARS LATER, I STAND HERE WITH THE SINCEREST PRAYER THAT HISTORY IS ABOUT TO REPEAT ITSELF WITH THE ELECTION
OF DONALD J TRUMP.
[CHEERING] YOU KNOW, MOST OF OUR NATION'S
ELDERS HAD STRONG FACE AS I DO
IN OUR LORD AND SAVIOR, JESUS
CHRIST.
[CHEERING] MY FAMILY HAS LIVED IN VIRGINIA
SINCE THE 1500S AND LYNCHBURG, VIRGINIA SINCE 1834. MY WIFE IS A DESCENDENT OF GEORGE WASHINGTON'S FAMILY.
EVERY DAY I DRIVE PAST THE SUMMER HOME OF THOMAS JEFFERSON WHO WROTE IN THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE WE ARE ENDOWED BY
OUR CREATOR WITH CERTAIN
UNALIENABLE RIGHTS AND AMONG
THESE ARE LIFE, LIBERTY, AND THE
PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS.
[CHEERING] OUR FOUNDING FATHERS ENVISIONED
A GOVERNMENT THAT EXISTED ONLY TO PROTECT THESE GOD-GIVEN RIGHTS AND A NATION GOVERNED BY
CITIZEN LEGISLATORS. THE MOST EFFECTIVE POLICIES WHOSE -- POLITICIANS WHENEVER CAREER POLITICIANS, BUT
SURVEYORS, ARCHITECTS, MINISTERS, FARMERS, IF THIS MEN
AND EVEN ACTORS WHO ARE SUCCESSFUL IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR
BEFORE SERVING IN GOVERNMENT. DONALD TRUMP FOLLOWS IN THIS
RICH TRADITION. HE HAS CREATED JOBS FOR THOUSANDS AND IS ONE OF THE GREATEST VISIONARIES OF OUR
TIME.
[CHEERING] I FIRST SUPPORTED MR. DRUM AFTER I SPENT 20 YEARS AS A YOUNG LAWYER WORKING WITH MY FATHER TO
RESTORE LIBERTY UNIVERSITY TO
FINANCIAL HEALTH. SINCE 2007, LIBERTY HAS BECOME
THE MOST LARGEST AND LESS
PROSPEROUS CHRISTIAN UNIVERSITY
IN THE WORLD. I'M CONVINCED THAT DONALD TRUMP
CAN WORK THE SAME MAGIC FOR A NATION WITH $19 TRILLION IN
DEBT.
[CHEERING] MY FAMILY AND I HAVE GROWN TO
LOVE AND RESPECT THE TRUMPS FOR
OTHER REASONS.
WE HAVE NEVER MET SUCH A GENUINE
AND LOVING FAMILY, I TRULY BELIEVE MR. TRUMP IS AMERICA'S
BLUE-COLLAR BILLIONAIRE.
[CHEERING] HE IS DOWN TO EARTH, LOVES AMERICA AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. HE IS A TRUE PATRIOT AND A
CHAMPION OF THE COMMON MAN. MR. TRUMP HAS ADDED A PLANK TO
THIS PARTY PLATFORM TO REPEAL
IRS RULES SPONSORED BY LYNDON JOHNSON IN 1954 BARRING CHURCHES AND NONPROFIT FROM EXPRESSING POLITICAL FREE SPEECH.
[CHEERING] CONSERVATIVE UNIVERSITIES AND
CHURCHES HAVE BEEN INVESTIGATED WHILE AUTHORITIES HAVE TO OFTEN
TURNED A BLIND EYE TOWARDS
LIBERAL GROUPS, INCLUDING UNIVERSITIES WERE LEFT-WING IDEOLOGY IS SO PERVASIVE THAT THEY HAVE AN EFFECT BECOME DEMOCRATIC VOTER INDOCTRINATION
CAMPS. TRUST ME, THE REPEAL OF THE JOHNSON AMENDMENT WILL CREATE A HUGE REVOLUTION FOR CONSERVATIVE CHRISTIANS AND FOR FREE SPEECH.
[CHEERING] WE ARE AT A CROSSROADS WHERE OUR FIRST PRIORITY MUST BE SAVING
OUR NATION. WE MUST UNITE BEHIND DONALD
TRUMP AND MIKE PENCE.
[CHEERING] IF YOU ARE A CONSERVATIVE, A
DECISION NOT TO VOTE OR TO VOTE
FOR A THIRD-PARTY CANDIDATE IS A
DE FACTO VOTE FOR HILLARY
CLINTON.
[CHEERING] IF HILLARY CLINTON IS ALLOWED TO
APPOINT THE NEXT SUPREME COURT JUSTICES, THAT IN ITSELF COULD BE A FATAL BLOW TO OUR REPUBLIC. ON THE OTHER HAND, A VOTE FOR DONALD TRUMP IS A VOTE TO UPHOLD
THE SECOND AMENDMENT RIGHT TO
BEAR ARMS.
[CHEERING] A VOTE FOR DONALD TRUMP IS A BUS TO STOP IRAN, AND NATION
COMMITTED TO THE DESTRUCTION OF
THE STATE OF ISRAEL FROM BECOMING A NUCLEAR POWER. A VOTE FOR DONALD TRUMP IS A VOTE TO APPOINT CONSERVATIVE PRO-LIFE JUSTICES TO THE SUPREME COURT.
[CHEERING] IN THE DAYS BEFORE MY FATHER PASSED AWAY, HE JOKED WITH CNN
THAT HE DREAMED THAT CHELSEA CLINTON HAD INTERVIEWED HIM
ABOUT THE 30 GREATEST THREATS -- THREE GREATEST THREAT FACING THE
NATION. HE REPLIED THAT THEY ARE OSAMA, OBAMA, AND YO' MAMA.
[CHEERING] WELL, OSAMA IS NOW GONE, OBAMA
HAS SIX MONTHS LEFT --
[CHEERING] AND THE ONLY WAY TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AND ONE AGAIN IS TO TELL CHELSEA'S MAMA YOU ARE FIRED.
[CHEERING] AND THE ONLY WAY TO DO THAT IS
TO ELECT DONALD TRUMP AND MIGHT HENCE PRESIDENT AND VICE
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.
-- MIKE PENCE PRESIDENT AND VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.
[CHEERING] THANK YOU AND GOD BLESS YOU AND
GOD BLESS AMERICA!
