<strong>Barack Obama</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> PRESIDENT OBAMA: THANK YOU.
[CHEERS] THANK YOU. THANK YOU.
[CHEERS] THANK YOU.
[CHEERS] THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU, EVERYBODY.
[CHEERS] THANK YOU SO<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> MUCH, EVERYBODY.
[CHEERS]
>> YES WE DID. YES WE DID. PRESIDENT OBAMA: THANK YOU.
[CHEERS] THANK YOU SO MUCH, EVERYBODY.
[CHEERS] I LOVE YOU BACK.
[CHEERS] HELLO, AMERICA. HELLO, DEMOCRATS. 12 YEARS AGO, TONIGHT. I ADDRESSED THIS CONVENTION FOR
THE VERY FIRST TIME. YOU MET MY TWO LITTLE GIRLS. NOW TO AMAZING YOUNG WOMEN WHO
FILL ME WITH PRIDE.
[CHEERS] YOU FELL FROM A BRILLIANT WHITE
AND PARTNER, MICHELLE.
[CHEERS] WHO HAS MADE ME A BETTER FATHER
AND A BETTER MAN.
WHO HAS GONE ON TO INSPIRE OUR
NATION AND FIRST LADY.
[CHEERS] AND WHO SOMEHOW HAS NOT AGED
DAY.
[CHEERS] THE SAME CANNOT BE SAID FOR ME.
[LAUGHTER] MY GIRLS REMIND ME ALL THE TIME. YOU'VE CHANGED SO MUCH, THAT IT. THEN THEY -- DADDY. THEN THEY TRY TO CLEAN IT UP,
NOT BAD, JUST MORE MATURE.
[LAUGHTER] AND IT IS TRUE. I WAS SO YOUNG THAT FIRST TIME.
[CHEERS] AND LOOK, I WILL ADMIT, MAYBE I
WAS A LITTLE NERVOUS. ADDRESSING SUCH A CROWD. BUT I WAS FILLED WITH FAITH.
[CHEERS] FAITH IN AMERICA. THE GENEROUS, BIGHEARTED, HOPEFUL COUNTRY THAT MADE MY STORY, THAT MADE ALL OF OUR
STORIES POSSIBLE. A LOT HAS HAPPENED OVER THE
YEARS. WHILE THIS NATION HAS BEEN
TESTED BY WAR AND IT HAS BEEN
TESTED BY RECESSION AND ALL
MANNER OF CHALLENGES, I STAND
BEFORE YOU AGAIN TONIGHT AFTER
ALMOST TWO TERMS AS YOUR PRESIDENT TO TELL YOU I AM MORE
OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THE FUTURE OF AMERICA THAN EVER BEFORE.
[CHEERS] HOW COULD I NOT BE? AFTER ALL THAT WE HAVE ACHIEVED
TOGETHER. AFTER THE WORST RECESSION IN 80 YEARS.
WE FOUGHT OUR WAY BACK.
WE HAVE SEEN DEFICITS COME DOWN.
401(K)S RECOVERED. AUTO INDUSTRY SET A RECORD. UNEMPLOYMENT REACHED A YEAR LOWS AND BUSINESSES CREATE MORE THAN 50 MILLION NEW JOBS.
[CHEERS] AFTER A CENTURY OF TRYING, WE DECLARED HEALTH CARE IN AMERICA IS NOT A PRIVILEGE FOR A FEW, IT
IS A RIGHT FOR EVERYBODY.
[CHEERS] AFTER DECADES OF TALK, WE FEEL
HE BEGAN TO WAEN OURSELVES OFF
OF FOREIGN OIL. WE DOUBLED OUR PRODUCTION OF CLEAN ENERGY.
[CHEERS] WE BROUGHT MORE OF OUR TROOPS
HOME TO THEIR FAMILIES.
AND WE DELIVER JUSTICE TO OSAMA
BIN LADEN.
[CHEERS] THROUGH DIPLOMACY, WE SHUT DOWN IRAN'S NUCLEAR WEAPONS PROGRAM. WE OPENED UP A NEW CHAPTER WITH
THE PEOPLE OF CUBA. BROUGHT NEARLY 200 NATIONS
TOGETHER AROUND THE CLIMATE AGREEMENT THAT CONTAINS -- COULD
SAY THIS PLANET FOR OUR
CHILDREN.
-- SAVE THIS PLANET FOR OUR
CHILDREN.
[CHEERS] WE PUT POLICIES IN PLACE TO HELP LOANS. CUT VETERANS HOMELESSNESS IN
HALF. ANN CALLIS ASK OF QUIET COURAGE,
-- AND THROUGH COUNTLESS ACT
OF QUIET COURAGE, WE HAVE MADE
MARRIAGE EQUALITY AND THE LAW OF
THE LAND.
[CHEERS] BY SO MANY MEASURES, OUR COUNTRY IS STRONGER AND MORE PROSPEROUS
THAN IT WAS WHEN WE FIRST STARTED. ANSWER EVERY VICTORY, AND EVERY SETBACK, I'VE INSISTED THAT
CHANGE IS NEVER EASY. NEVER QUIT. WE WOULD NOT MEET ALL OF OUR
CHALLENGES AND ONE TERM OR ONE
PRESIDENCY. OR EVEN ONE LIFETIME. TONIGHT, I'M HERE TO TELL YOU THAT TONIGHT, WE STILL HAVE MORE
WORK TO DO MORE WORK TO DO FOR EVERY AMERICAN IN NEED OF A GOOD
JOB. PAID LEAVE FOR DECENT
RETIREMENT. FOR EVERY CHILD WHO NEEDS A
LADDER OUT OF POVERTY OR WORLD-CLASS EDUCATION. FOR EVERYONE WHO IS NOT YET FELT THE PROGRESS OF THESE PAST SEVEN AND HALF YEARS. WE NEED TO KEEP MAKING OUR STREETS SAFER IN OUR CRIMINAL
JUSTICE SYSTEM FAIR.
[CHEERS] OUR HOMELAND MORE SECURE, OUR
WORLD MORE PEACEFUL AND
SUSTAINABLE FOR THE NEXT GENERATION.
[CHEERS]
WE ARE NOT DONE PROTECTING OUR
UNION. LIVING UP TO OUR FOUNDING.
-- FOUNDING CREED THAT ALL OF US ARE CREATED EQUAL AND ALL OF US
ARE FREE IN THE EYES OF GOD.
[CHEERS] THAT WORK INVOLVES A BIG CHOICE THIS NOVEMBER. I THINK IT IS FAIR TO SAY THAT
THIS IS NOT YOUR TYPICAL ELECTION.
[LAUGHTER] IT IS NOT JUST A CHOICE BETWEEN PARTIES OR POLICIES, THE USUAL DEBATES BETWEEN LEFT AND RIGHT. THIS IS A MORE FUNDAMENTAL CHOICE. ABOUT WHO WE ARE AS A PEOPLE. AND WHETHER WE STAY TRUE TO THIS
GREAT AMERICAN EXPERIENCE -- EXPERIMENT AND GOVERNMENT. LOOK, WE DEMOCRATS HAVE ALWAYS
HAD PLENTY OF DIFFERENCES WITH
THE REPUBLICAN PARTY.
AND THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH
THAT. IT IS PRECISELY THIS CONTEST OF IDEAS THAT PUSHES OUR COUNTRY
FORWARD.
[CHEERS] BUT WE HEARD IN CLEVELAND LAST WEEK WAS NOT PARTICULARLY
REPUBLICAN. AND IT SURE WASN'T CONSERVATIVE. WHAT WE HEARD WAS A DEEPLY AS A MYSTIC VISION OF A COUNTRY WHERE RETURN AGAINST EACH OTHER IN
TURN AWAY FROM THE REST OF THE
WORLD.
THERE WERE NO SERIOUS SOLUTIONS
TO PRESSING PROBLEMS. JUST THE THINNING OF RESENTMENT AND BLAME AND ANGER AND THAT IS
NOT THE AMERICA I KNOW. THE AMERICA I KNOW IS FULL OF
COURAGE AND OPTIMISM AND
INGENUITY. THE AMERICAN I KNOW IS DECENT AND GENEROUS SURE WE HAVE REAL ANXIETIES ABOUT PAYING BILLS AND
PROTECTING OUR KIDS. WE GET FRUSTRATED WITH POLITICAL GRIDLOCK AND WORRY ABOUT RACIAL DIVISION. WE ARE SHOCKED AND SADDENED BY THE MADNESS OF ORLANDO OR NICE. THERE ARE POCKETS OF AMERICA
THAT NEVER RECOVERED FROM FACTORY CLOSURES. MANY TOOK PRIDE AND HARD WORK AND PROVIDED FOR THE FAMILIES
WHO NOW FEEL FORGOTTEN. PARENTS WHO WONDER WHETHER KIDS
WILL HAVE THE SAME OPPORTUNITIES
THAT WE HAD. ALL THAT ISRAEL. WE'RE CHALLENGED TO DO BETTER;
TO BE BETTER. BUT AS I'VE TRAVELED THIS COUNTRY, THROUGH ALL FIFTY
STATES; AS I'VE REJOICED WITH
YOU AND MOURNED WITH YOU, WHAT
I'VE ALSO SEEN, MORE THAN
ANYTHING, IS WHAT IS RIGHT WITH
AMERICA.
[CHEERS] I SEE PEOPLE WORKING HARD AND
STARTING BUSINESSES; PEOPLE
TEACHING KIDS AND SERVING OUR
COUNTRY. I SEE ENGINEERS INVENTING STUFF,
AND DOCTORS COMING UP WITH NEW CURES. I SEE A YOUNGER GENERATION FULL OF ENERGY AND NEW IDEAS, NOT
CONSTRAINED BY WHAT IS, READY TO
SEIZE WHAT OUGHT TO BE.
[CHEERS] MOST OF ALL, I SEE AMERICANS OF
EVERY PARTY, EVERY BACKGROUND,
EVERY FAITH WHO BELIEVE THAT WE
ARE STRONGER TOGETHER.
BLACK, WHITE, LATINO, ASIAN, NATIVE AMERICAN; YOUNG AND OLD;
GAY, STRAIGHT, MEN, WOMEN, FOLKS
WITH DISABILITIES, ALL PLEDGING ALLEGIANCE, UNDER THE SAME PROUD FLAG, TO THIS BIG, BOLD COUNTRY THAT WE LOVE.
[CHEERS] THAT IS WHAT I SEE.
THAT IS THE AMERICA I KNOW.
[CHEERS] AND THERE IS ONLY ONE CANDIDATE IN THIS RACE WHO BELIEVES IN THAT FUTURE, AND HAS DEVOTED HER LIFE TO IT; A MOTHER AND
GRANDMOTHER WHO'D DO ANYTHING TO HELP OUR CHILDREN THRIVE; A
LEADER WITH REAL PLANS TO BREAK
DOWN BARRIERS, BLAST THROUGH
GLASS CEILINGS, AND WIDEN THE
CIRCLE OF OPPORTUNITY TO EVERY SINGLE AMERICAN, THE NEXT
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, HILLARY CLINTON.
[CHEERS]
>> HILLARY.
HILLARY. HILLARY. PRESIDENT OBAMA: THAT IS RIGHT. LET ME TELL YOU, NOW, EIGHT
YEARS AGO, HILLARY AND I WERE
RIVALS FOR THE DEMOCRATIC
NOMINATION. WE BATTLED FOR A YEAR AND A HALF. LET ME TELL YOU, IT WAS TOUGH, BECAUSE HILLARY'S TOP. I WAS WORN OUT.
[LAUGHTER] SHE WAS DOING EVERYTHING I WAS DOING, BUT IT WAS TOUGH.
[CHEERS] EVERY TIME I THOUGHT I MIGHT
HAVE THAT RACE WON, HILLARY JUST
CAME BACK STRONGER. BUT AFTER IT WAS ALL OVER, I
ASKED HILLARY TO JOIN MY TEAM. SHE WAS A LITTLE SURPRISED, BUT ULTIMATELY SAID YES  BECAUSE SHE KNEW THAT WHAT WAS AT STAKE WAS BIGGER THAN EITHER OF US. AND AND FOR FOUR YEARS, I HAD A
FRONT ROW SEAT TO HER INTELLIGENCE, HER JUDGMENT, AND
HER DISCIPLINE. I CAME TO REALIZE THAT HER
UNBELIEVABLE WORK ETHIC WASN'T
FOR PRAISE OR ATTENTION, THAT
SHE WAS IN THIS FOR EVERYONE WHO NEEDS A CHAMPION.
[CHEERS] I UNDERSTOOD THAT AFTER ALL
THESE YEARS, SHE HAS NEVER
FORGOTTEN JUST WHO SHE'S
FIGHTING FOR. HILLARY'S STILL GOT THE TENACITY SHE HAD AS A YOUNG WOMAN WORKING
AT THE CHILDREN'S DEFENSE FUND,
GOING DOOR TO DOOR TO ULTIMATELY
MAKE SURE KIDS WITH DISABILITIES
COULD GET A QUALITY EDUCATION.
[CHEERS] SHE'S STILL GOT THE HEART SHE
SHOWED AS OUR FIRST LADY,
WORKING WITH CONGRESS TO HELP
PUSH THROUGH A CHILDREN'S HEALTH
INSURANCE PROGRAM THAT TO THIS
DAY PROTECTS MILLIONS OF KIDS.
[CHEERS] SHE'S STILL SEARED WITH THE MEMORY OF EVERY AMERICAN SHE MET WHO LOST LOVED ONES ON 9/11, WHICH IS WHY, AS A SENATOR FROM
NEW YORK, SHE FOUGHT SO HARD FOR FUNDING TO HELP FIRST RESPONDERS, TO HELP THE CITY REBUILD WHY, AS SECRETARY OF
, STATE, SHE SAT WITH ME IN THE SITUATION ROOM AND FORCEFULLY ARGUED IN FAVOR OF THE MISSION THAT TOOK OUT BIN LADEN.
[CHEERS] YOU KNOW, NOTHING TRULY PREPARES
YOU FOR THE DEMANDS OF THE OVAL
OFFICE. YOU CAN READ ABOUT IT, YOU CAN STUDY IT. UNTIL YOU HAVE SET AT THE DESK,
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO
MANAGE A GLOBAL CRISIS, OR SEND YOUNG PEOPLE TO WAR. BUT HILLARY'S BEEN IN THE ROOM;
SHE'S BEEN PART OF THOSE
DECISIONS. SHE KNOWS WHAT'S AT STAKE IN THE DECISIONS OUR GOVERNMENT MAKES
FOR THE WORKING FAMILY, THE
SENIOR CITIZEN, THE SMALL
BUSINESS OWNER, THE SOLDIER, AND
THE VETERAN. EVEN IN THE MIDST OF CRISIS, SHE
LISTENS TO PEOPLE, AND KEEPS HER
COOL, AND TREATS EVERYBODY WITH
RESPECT. AND NO MATTER HOW DAUNTING THE
ODDS; NO MATTER HOW MUCH PEOPLE
TRY TO KNOCK HER DOWN, SHE NEVER, EVER POINTS.
[CHEERS]
-- QUITS.
[CHEERS] THAT'S THE HILLARY I KNOW. THAT'S THE HILLARY I'VE COME TO ADMIRE. AND THAT'S WHY I CAN SAY WITH CONFIDENCE THERE HAS NEVER BEEN A MAN OR A WOMAN MORE QUALIFIED THAN HILLARY CLINTON TO SERVE AS
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.
[CHEERS] I HOPE YOU DON'T MIND BILL, BUT
I WAS JUST FIND THE TRUTH.
AND, BY THE WAY, IN CASE YOU
WERE WONDERING ABOUT HER
JUDGMENT, LOOK AT HER CHOICE OF
RUNNING MATE.
[CHEERS] TIM KAINE IS AS GOOD A MAN, AS
HUMBLE AND COMMITTED A PUBLIC SERVANT AS ANYONE I KNOW. I KNOW HIS FAMILY AND I LOVE HIS
WIFE AND HIS KIDS.
HE WILL BE A GREAT VICE
PRESIDENT, AND HE'LL MAKE
HILLARY A BETTER PRESIDENT. JUST
LIKE MY DEAR FRIEND AND BROTHER JOE BIDEN HAS MADE ME A BETTER
PRESIDENT.
[CHEERS] NOW, HILLARY HAS REAL PLANS TO
ADDRESS THE CONCERNS SHE'S HEARD
FROM YOU ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL.
SHE'S GOT SPECIFIC IDEAS TO INVEST IN NEW JOBS, TO HELP
WORKERS SHARE IN THEIR COMPANY'S PROFITS, TO HELP PUT KIDS IN PRESCHOOL, AND PUT STUDENTS THROUGH COLLEGE WITHOUT TAKING ON A TENANT THAT.
-- TON OF DEBT. THAT'S WHAT LEADERS DO. AND THEN THERE'S DONALD TRUMP.
>> BOO! PRESIDENT OBAMA: DON'T BOO, V OTE. THE DONALD IS NOT REALLY A PLANS
GUY.
[LAUGHTER] HE IS NOT REALLY A FAX GUY
EITHER. HE CALLS HIMSELF A BUSINESS GUY, WHICH IS TRUE, BUT I HAVE TO SAY, I KNOW PLENTY OF BUSINESSMEN AND WOMEN WHO'VE ACHIEVED SUCCESS WITHOUT LEAVING A TRAIL OF LAWSUITS, AND UNPAID WORKERS, AND PEOPLE FEELING LIKE THEY GOT CHEATED.
[CHEERS] DOES ANYONE REALLY BELIEVE THAT
A GUY WHO'S SPENT HIS 70 YEARS
ON THIS EARTH SHOWING NO REGARD
FOR WORKING PEOPLE IS SUDDENLY
GOING TO BE A CHAMPION? YOUR VOICE? IF SO, YOU SHOULD VOTE FOR HIM. BUT IF YOU'RE SOMEONE WHO'S
TRULY CONCERNED ABOUT PAYING
YOUR BILLS, AND YOU ARE
CONCERNED ABOUT POCKET BUSH -- POCKETBOOK ISSUES AND SCENIC ECONOMY GROWTH AND CREATING MORE
OPPORTUNITY FOR EVERYBODY, THEN THE CHOICE ISN'T EVEN CLOSE. IF IF YOU WANT SOMEONE WITH A
LIFELONG TRACK RECORD OF
FIGHTING FOR HIGHER WAGES,
BETTER BENEFITS, A FAIRER TAX
CODE, A BIGGER VOICE FOR
WORKERS, AND STRONGER
REGULATIONS ON WALL STREET, THEN
YOU SHOULD VOTE FOR HILLARY
CLINTON.
[CHEERS] AND IF YOU'RE CONCERNED ABOUT
WHO'S GOING TO KEEP YOU AND YOUR
FAMILY SAFE IN A DANGEROUS WORLD
, WELL, THE CHOICE IS EVEN
CLEARER. HILLARY CLINTON IS RESPECTED AROUND THE WORLD NOT JUST BY
LEADERS, BUT BY THE PEOPLE THEY
SERVE. I HAVE TO SAY THIS, PEOPLE OUTSIDE OF THE END -- UNITED STATES DO NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT IS
GOING ON IN THIS ELECTION.
[LAUGHTER] THEY REALLY DON'T. THEY KNOW HILLARY.
THEY HAVE SEEN HER WORK. SHE'S WORKED CLOSELY WITH OUR INTELLIGENCE TEAMS, OUR DIPLOMATS, OUR MILITARY.
SHE HAS THE JUDGMENT, THE EXPERIENCE, AND THE TEMPERAMENT TO MEET THE THREAT FROM TERRORISM.
IT IS NOT NEW TO HER.
OUR TROOPS HAVE POUNDED ISIL WITHOUT MERCY, TAKING OUT
LEADERS, TAKING BACK TERRITORY. I KNOW HILLARY WON'T RELENT
UNTIL ISIL IS DESTROYED. SHE'LL
FINISH THE JOB.
[CHEERS] AND SHE'LL DO IT WITHOUT
RESORTING TO TORTURE, OR BANNING
ENTIRE RELIGIONS FROM ENTERING
OUR COUNTRY. SHE IS FIT TO BE THE NEXT COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF.
[CHEERS] MEANWHILE, DONALD TRUMP CALLS
OUR MILITARY AND DISASTER.
-- A DISASTER. APPARENTLY, HE DOESN'T KNOW THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO MAKE UP THE
STRONGEST FIGHTING FORCE THE
WORLD HAS EVER KNOWN.
[CHEERS] HE SUGGESTS AMERICA IS WEAK. HE
MUST NOT HEAR THE BILLIONS OF
MEN, WOMEN, AND CHILDREN, FROM
THE BALTICS TO BURMA, WHO STILL
LOOK TO AMERICA TO BE THE LIGHT
OF FREEDOM, DIGNITY, AND HUMAN RIGHTS.
[CHEERS] HE COZIES UP TO PUTIN, PRAISES
SADDAM HUSSEIN, AND TELLS THE
NATO ALLIES THAT STOOD BY OUR
SIDE AFTER 9/11 THAT THEY HAVE
TO PAY UP IF THEY WANT OUR PROTECTION. WELL, AMERICA'S PROMISES DO NOT
COME WITH A PRICE TAG.
WE MEET OUR COMMITMENTS. AND AND THAT'S ONE REASON WHY ALMOST EVERY COUNTRY ON EARTH SEES AMERICA AS STRONGER AND MORE RESPECTED TODAY THAN THEY DID EIGHT YEARS AGO WHEN I TOOK
OFFICE.
[CHEERS] AMERICA IS ALREADY GREAT.
[CHEERS] AMERICA IS ALREADY STRONG.
[CHEERS] AND I PROMISE YOU, OUR STRENGTH, OUR GREATNESS, DOES NOT DEPEND ON DONALD TRUMP. IN FACT, IT DOESN'T DEPEND ON ANY ONE PERSON.
AND THAT, IN THE END, MAY BE THE
BIGGEST DIFFERENCE IN THIS
ELECTION THE MEANING OF OUR
, DEMOCRACY. RONALD REAGAN CALLED AMERICA "A SHINING CITY ON A HILL." DONALD
TRUMP CALLS IT "A DIVIDED CRIME
SCENE" THAT ONLY HE CAN FIX. IT IT DOESN'T MATTER TO HIM THAT
ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION AND THE
CRIME RATE ARE AS LOW AS THEY'VE
BEEN IN DECADES, BECAUSE HE'S NOT ACTUALLY OFFERING ANY REAL SOLUTION TO THOSE ISSUES. HE'S JUST OFFERING SLOGANS, AND HE'S OFFERING FAIR. HE'S BETTING THAT IF HE SCARES ENOUGH PEOPLE, HE MIGHT SCORE
JUST ENOUGH VOTES TO WIN THIS ELECTION. THAT IS ANOTHER BET THAT DONALD TRUMP WILL LOSE. THE REASON HE WILL LOSE IT IS BECAUSE HE'S SELLING THE AMERICAN PEOPLE SHORT.
WE ARE NOT A FRAGILE OR PRIDEFUL PEOPLE.
OUR POWER DOESN'T COME FROM SOME SELF-DECLARED SAVIOR PROMISING THAT HE ALONE CAN RESTORE ORDER. AS LONG AS WE DO THINGS HIS WAY.
WE DON'T LOOK TO BE ROLLED.
-- RULED.
[CHEERS] OUR POWER COMES FROM THOSE
IMMORTAL DECLARATIONS FIRST PUT
TO PAPER RIGHT HERE IN
PHILADELPHIA ALL THOSE YEARS
AGO; WE HOLD THESE TRUTHS TO BE
SELF-EVIDENT, THAT ALL MEN ARE
CREATED EQUAL; THAT TOGETHER,
WE, THE PEOPLE, CAN FORM A MORE PERFECT UNION.
[CHEERS] THAT'S WHO WE ARE. THAT'S OUR BIRTHRIGHT. THE CAPACITY TO SHAPE OUR OWN DESTINY.
[CHEERS] THAT'S WHAT DROVE PATRIOTS TO
CHOOSE REVOLUTION OVER TYRANNY
AND OUR GIS TO LIBERATE A
CONTINENT. IT'S WHAT GAVE WOMEN THE COURAGE TO REACH FOR THE BALLOT, AND
MARCHERS TO CROSS A BRIDGE IN
SELMA, AND WORKERS TO ORGANIZE
AND FIGHT FOR BETTER WAGES.
[CHEERS] AMERICA HAS NEVER BEEN ABOUT
WHAT ONE PERSON SAYS HE'LL DO
FOR US. IT'S ABOUT WHAT CAN BE ACHIEVED BY US, TOGETHER, THROUGH THE
HARD, SLOW, SOMETIMES FRUSTRATING, BUT ULTIMATELY ENDURING WORK OF SELF-GOVERNMENT.
AND THAT'S WHAT HILLARY CLINTON UNDERSTANDS.
[CHEERS] SHE KNOWS THAT THIS IS A BIG, DIVERSE COUNTRY, SHE HAS SEEN IT. SHE UNDERSTANDS THAT MOST ISSUES
ARE RARELY BLACK AND WHITE. SHE UNDERSTANDS THAT EVEN WHEN YOU'RE 100% RIGHT GETTING THINGS
, DONE REQUIRES COPPER MINES.
THAT DEMOCRACY DOESN'T WORK IF WE CONSTANTLY DEMONIZE EACH OTHER.
[CHEERS] SHE KNOWS THAT FOR PROGRESS TO
HAPPEN, WE HAVE TO LISTEN TO
EACH OTHER, SEE OURSELVES IN
EACH OTHER, FIGHT FOR OUR
PRINCIPLES BUT ALSO FIGHT TO
FIND COMMON GROUND, NO MATTER
HOW ELUSIVE THAT MAY SEEM.
[CHEERS] HILLARY KNOWS WE CAN WORK
THROUGH RACIAL DIVIDES IN THIS
COUNTRY WHEN WE REALIZE THE
WORRY BLACK PARENTS FEEL WHEN
THEIR SON LEAVES THE HOUSE ISN'T
SO DIFFERENT THAN WHAT A BRAVE
COP'S FAMILY FEELS WHEN HE PUTS
ON THE BLUE AND GOES TO WORK;
THAT WE CAN HONOR POLICE AND
TREAT EVERY COMMUNITY FAIRLY.

[CHEERS] SHE KNOWS THAT ACKNOWLEDGING PROBLEMS THAT HAVE FESTERED FOR
DECADES ISN'T MAKING RACE RELATIONS WORSE, IT'S CREATING
THE POSSIBILITY FOR PEOPLE OF GOOD WILL TO JOIN AND MAKE
THINGS BETTER.
[CHEERS] HILLARY KNOWS WE CAN INSIST ON A LAWFUL AND ORDERLY IMMIGRATION SYSTEM WHILE STILL SEEING STRIVING STUDENTS AND THEIR TOILING PARENTS AS LOVING FAMILIES, NOT CRIMINALS OR RAPISTS; FAMILIES THAT CAME HERE FOR THE SAME REASONS OUR FOREBEARS CAME, TO WORK, AND STUDY, AND MAKE A BETTER LIFE, IN A PLACE WHERE WE CAN TALK AND
WORSHIP AND LOVE AS WE PLEASE. SHE KNOWS THEIR DREAM IS QUINTESSENTIALLY AMERICAN, AND
THE AMERICAN DREAM IS SOMETHING
NO WALL WILL EVER CONTAIN.
[CHEERS] THESE ARE THE THINGS HILLARY
KNOWS.
IT CAN BE FRUSTRATING, THIS BUSINESS OF DEMOCRACY. TRUST ME, I KNOW. HILLARY KNOWS, TOO. WHEN THE OTHER SIDE REFUSES TO
COMPROMISE, PROGRESS CAN STALL. PEOPLE ARE HURT BY INACTION. SUPPORTERS CAN GROW IMPATIENT, AND WORRY THAT YOU'RE NOT TRYING
HARD ENOUGH; THAT YOU'VE MAYBE
SOLD OUT.
BUT I PROMISE YOU, WHEN WE KEEP
AT IT; WHEN WE CHANGE ENOUGH MINDS; WHEN WE DELIVER ENOUGH VOTES, THEN PROGRESS DOES HAPPEN. JUST ASK THE 20 MILLION MORE
PEOPLE WHO HAVE HEALTH CARE
TODAY.
[CHEERS] JUST ASK THE MARINE WHO PROUDLY SERVES HIS COUNTRY WITHOUT HIDING THE HUSBAND HE LOVES.

[CHEERS] DEMOCRACY WORKS, BUT WE GOTTA WANTED, NOT JUST DURING AN
ELECTION YEAR, BUT ALL THE DAYS IN BETWEEN.
[CHEERS] SO IF YOU AGREE THAT THERE'S TOO
MUCH INEQUALITY IN OUR ECONOMY,
AND TOO MUCH MONEY IN OUR
POLITICS, WE ALL NEED TO BE AS
VOCAL AND AS ORGANIZED AND AS
PERSISTENT AS BERNIE SANDERS'
SUPPORTERS HAVE BEEN DURING THE
SELECTION.
[CHEERS]
-- THIS ELECTION.
[CHEERS] WE ALL NEED TO GET OUT AND VOTE
FOR DEMOCRATS UP AND DOWN THE
TICKET, AND THEN HOLD THEM
ACCOUNTABLE UNTIL THEY GET THE
JOB DONE.
[CHEERS] THAT'S RIGHT. FEEL THE BERN!
[CHEERS] IF YOU WANT MORE JUSTICE IN THE
JUSTICE SYSTEM, THEN WE'VE ALL
GOT TO VOTE NOT JUST FOR A
PRESIDENT, BUT FOR MAYORS, AND SHERIFFS, AND STATE'S ATTORNEYS, AND STATE LEGISLATORS. THAT IS WHERE THE CRIMINAL LAWS ARE MADE AND WE'VE GOT TO WORK
WITH POLICE AND PROTESTERS UNTIL LAWS AND PRACTICES ARE CHANGED.
[CHEERS] THAT IS HOW DEMOCRACY WORKS. IF YOU WANT TO FIGHT CLIMATE CHANGE, WE'VE GOT TO ENGAGE NOT ONLY YOUNG PEOPLE ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES, BUT REACH OUT TO THE COAL MINER WHO'S WORRIED ABOUT TAKING CARE OF HIS FAMILY, THE SINGLE MOM WORRIED ABOUT GAS PRICES.
[CHEERS] IF YOU WANT TO PROTECT OUR KIDS AND OUR COPS FROM GUN VIOLENCE, WE'VE GOT TO GET THE VAST
MAJORITY OF AMERICANS, INCLUDING
GUN OWNERS, WHO AGREE ON
BACKGROUND CHECKS TO BE JUST AS
VOCAL AND DETERMINED AS THE GUN
LOBBY THAT BLOCKS CHANGE THROUGH EVERY FUNERAL THAT WE HOLD.
[CHEERS] THAT IS HOW CHANGE HAPPENS.
[CHEERS] LOOK, HILLARY'S GOT HER SHARE OF
CRITICS. SHE'S BEEN CARICATURED BY THE
RIGHT AND BY SOME FOLKS ON THE
LEFT; ACCUSED OF EVERYTHING YOU CAN IMAGINE AND SOME THINGS YOU
, CANNOT.
[LAUGHTER] BUT SHE KNOWS THAT'S WHAT
HAPPENS WHEN YOU'RE UNDER A
MICROSCOPE FOR 40 YEARS.
[CHEERS] SHE KNOWS THAT SOMETIMES AND
THOSE 40 YEARS SHE'S MADE
MISTAKES.
JUST LIKE I HAVE; JUST LIKE WE
ALL DO. THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE TRY.

[CHEERS] THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU'RE THE KIND OF CITIZEN TEDDY ROOSEVELT ONCE DESCRIBED NOT THE
, TIMID SOULS WHO CRITICIZE FROM THE SIDELINES, BUT SOMEONE "WHO IS ACTUALLY IN THE ARENAWHO STRIVES VALIANTLY; WHO ERRS[BUT] WHO AT THE BEST KNOWS IN THE END
THE TRIUMPH OF HIGH ACHIEVEMENT."
[CHEERS] HILLARY CLINTON IS THAT WOMAN IN
THE ARENA.
[CHEERS] SHE'S BEEN THERE FOR US  EVEN IF
WE HAVEN'T ALWAYS NOTICED. AND AND IF YOU'RE SERIOUS ABOUT OUR
DEMOCRACY, YOU CAN'T AFFORD TO
STAY HOME JUST BECAUSE SHE MIGHT
NOT ALIGN WITH YOU ON EVERY
ISSUE. YOU'VE GOT TO GET IN THE ARENA
WITH HER, BECAUSE DEMOCRACY
ISN'T A SPECTATOR SPORT. AMERICA
ISN'T ABOUT "YES HE WILL." IT'S
ABOUT "YES WE CAN." AND WE'RE

[CHEERS] AND WE'RE GOING TO CARRY HILLARY
TO VICTORY THIS FALL, BECAUSE
THAT'S WHAT THE MOMENT DEMANDS.
[CHEERS] YES WE CAN. YOU KNOW, THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF
TALK IN THIS CAMPAIGN ABOUT WHAT
AMERICA HAS LOST. PEOPLE WHO TELL US THAT OUR WAY OF LIFE IS BEING UNDERMINED BY PERNICIOUS CHANGES AND DARK FORCES BEYOND OUR CONTROL. THEY TELL VOTERS THERE'S A "REAL AMERICA" OUT THERE THAT MUST BE RESTORED. THIS ISN'T AN IDEA THAT STARTED WITH DONALD TRUMP.
IT'S BEEN PEDDLED BY POLITICIANS FOR A LONG TIME. PROBABLY FROM THE START OF OUR REPUBLIC. AND IT'S GOT ME THINKING ABOUT THE STORY I TOLD YOU TWELVE
YEARS AGO TONIGHT, ABOUT MY
KANSAS GRANDPARENTS AND THE
THINGS THEY TAUGHT ME WHEN I WAS
GROWING UP. THEY CAME FROM THE HEARTLAND;
THEIR ANCESTORS BEGAN SETTLING THERE ABOUT 200 YEARS AGO. THEY I DON'T KNOW IF THEY HAD THEIR
BIRTH CERTIFICATES.
[LAUGHTER] THEY WERE SCOTCH-IRISH MOSTLY,
FARMERS, TEACHERS, RANCH HANDS,
PHARMACISTS, OIL RIG WORKERS. HARDY, SMALL-TOWN FOLKS. SOME WERE DEMOCRATS, BUT A LOT OF THEM, MAYBE EVEN MOST OF THEM
WERE REPUBLICANS. MY GRANDPARENTS EXPLAINED THAT
FOLKS IN THESE PARTS DID NOT
LIKE SHOWOFFS. THEY DIDN'T ADMIRE BRAGGARTS OR BULLIES. THEY DIDN'T RESPECT MEAN-SPIRITEDNESS, OR FOLKS WHO
WERE ALWAYS LOOKING FOR SHORTCUTS IN LIFE. INSTEAD, WHAT THEY VALUE WERE TRAITS LIKE HONESTY AND HARD WORK. KINDNESS, COURTESY, HUMILITY, RESPONSIBILITY HELPING EACH
, OTHER OUT. THAT'S WHAT THEY BELIEVED IN. TRUE THINGS. THINGS THAT LAST. THE THINGS WE TRY TO TEACH OUR KIDS. AND WHAT MY GRANDPARENTS
UNDERSTOOD WAS THAT THESE VALUES
WERE LIMITED TO KANSAS. THEY WEREN'T LIMITED TO SMALL TOWNS. THESE VALUES COULD TRAVEL TO HAWAII; EVEN THE OTHER SIDE OF
THE WORLD, WHERE MY MOTHER WOULD
END UP WORKING TO HELP POOR
WOMEN GET A BETTER LIFE.
[CHEERS] MY GRANDPARENTS KNEW THESE
VALUES WEREN'T RESERVED FOR ONE
RACE; THEY COULD BE PASSED DOWN
TO A HALF-KENYAN GRANDSON, OR A
HALF-ASIAN GRANDDAUGHTER; IN
FACT, THEY WERE THE SAME VALUES
MICHELLE'S PARENTS, THE
DESCENDANTS OF SLAVES, TAUGHT
THEIR OWN KIDS LIVING IN A
BUNGALOW ON THE SOUTH SIDE OF
CHICAGO.
[CHEERS] THEY KNEW THESE VALUES WERE
EXACTLY WHAT DREW IMMIGRANTS HERE, AND THEY BELIEVED THAT THE CHILDREN OF THOSE IMMIGRANTS WERE JUST AS AMERICAN AS THEIR OWN, WHETHER THEY WORE A COWBOY
HAT OR A YARMULKE; A BASEBALL CAP OR A HIJAB.
[CHEERS] AMERICA HAS CHANGED OVER THE
YEARS. BUT THESE VALUES MY GRANDPARENTS TAUGHT ME, THEY HAVEN'T GONE
ANYWHERE. THEY'RE AS STRONG AS EVER; STILL CHERISHED BY PEOPLE OF EVERY PARTY, EVERY RACE, AND EVERY FAITH. THEY LIVE ON IN EACH OF US. WHAT MAKES US AMERICAN, WHAT MAKES US PATRIOTS, IS BUTTON HERE. THAT'S WHAT MATTERS.
[CHEERS] THAT'S WHY WE CAN TAKE THE FOOD
AND MUSIC AND HOLIDAYS AND
STYLES OF OTHER COUNTRIES, AND
BLEND IT INTO SOMETHING UNIQUELY
OUR OWN. THAT'S WHY WE CAN ATTRACT
STRIVERS AND ENTREPRENEURS FROM
AROUND THE GLOBE TO BUILD NEW
FACTORIES AND CREATE NEW
INDUSTRIES HERE. THAT'S WHY OUR MILITARY CAN LOOK
THE WAY IT DOES, EVERY SHADE OF
HUMANITY, FORGED INTO COMMON
SERVICE. THAT'S WHY ANYONE WHO THREATENS
OUR VALUES, WHETHER FASCISTS OR
COMMUNISTS OR JIHADISTS OR
HOMEGROWN DEMAGOGUES, WILL
ALWAYS FAIL IN THE END.
[CHEERS] THAT IS AMERICA.
[CHEERS] THAT IS AMERICA.
THOSE BONDS OF AFFECTION; THAT COMMON CREED. WE DON'T FEAR THE FUTURE; WE SHAPE IT, EMBRACE IT, AS ONE PEOPLE, STRONGER TOGETHER THAN WE ARE ON OUR OWN. THAT'S WHAT HILLARY CLINTON UNDERSTANDS THIS FIGHTER, THIS
, STATESWOMAN, THIS MOTHER AND
GRANDMOTHER, THIS PUBLIC SERVANT, AS PATRIOT, THAT'S THE
AMERICA SHE'S FIGHTING FOR.
[CHEERS] AND THAT'S WHY I HAVE
CONFIDENCE, AS I LEAVE THIS
STAGE TONIGHT, THAT THE
DEMOCRATIC PARTY IS IN GOOD
HANDS.
[CHEERS] MY TIME IN THIS OFFICE HASN'T
FIXED EVERYTHING; AS MUCH AS
WE'VE DONE, THERE'S STILL SO
MUCH I WANT TO DO. BUT FOR ALL THE TOUGH LESSONS
I'VE HAD TO LEARN; FOR ALL THE
PLACES I'VE FALLEN SHORT; I'VE
TOLD HILLARY, AND I'LL TELL YOU
WHAT'S PICKED ME BACK UP, EVERY
SINGLE TIME. IT'S BEEN YOU.
[CHEERS] THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.
[CHEERS] IT'S THE LETTER I KEEP ON MY WALL FROM A SURVIVOR IN OHIO WHO TWICE ALMOST LOST EVERYTHING TO CANCER, BUT URGED ME TO KEEP FIGHTING FOR HEALTH CARE REFORM, EVEN WHEN THE BATTLE SEEMED
LOST.
DO NOT QUIT. IT'S THE PAINTING I KEEP IN MY
PRIVATE OFFICE, A BIG-EYED,
GREENAWALT WITH BLUE WINGS MADE
BY A SEVEN YEAR-OLD GIRL WHO WAS
TAKEN FROM US IN NEWTOWN, GIVEN
TO ME BY HER PARENTS SO I WOULDN'T FORGET A REMINDER OF
, ALL THE PARENTS WHO HAVE
TURNED THEIR GRIEF INTO ACTION.
[CHEERS] IT'S THE SMALL BUSINESS OWNER IN
COLORADO WHO CUT MOST OF HIS OWN
SALARY SO HE WOULDN'T HAVE TO
LAY OFF ANY OF HIS WORKERS IN THE RECESSION BECAUSE HE SAID,
"THAT WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN IN THE
SPIRIT OF AMERICA."
[CHEERS] IT'S THE CONSERVATIVE IN TEXAS
WHO SAID HE DISAGREED WITH ME ON
EVERYTHING, BUT APPRECIATED
THAT, LIKE HIM, I TRY TO BE A
GOOD DAD.
[CHEERS] IT'S THE COURAGE OF THE YOUNG
SOLDIER FROM ARIZONA WHO NEARLY
DIED ON THE BATTLEFIELD IN
AFGHANISTAN, BUT WHO'S LEARNED
TO SPEAK AGAIN AND WALK AGAIN. AND EARLIER THIS YEAR, STEPPED
THROUGH THE DOOR OF THE OVAL
OFFICE ON HIS OWN POWER, TO
SALUTE AND SHAKE MY HAND.
[CHEERS] IT'S EVERY AMERICAN WHO BELIEVED WE COULD CHANGE THIS COUNTRY FOR
THE BETTER, SO MANY OF YOU WHO'D
NEVER BEEN INVOLVED IN POLITICS, WHO PICKED UP PHONES, AND HIT
THE STREETS, AND USED THE INTERNET IN AMAZING NEW WAYS TO
-- THAT I DID NOT UNDERSTAND,
THAT MADE CHANGE HAPPEN.
YOU ARE THE BEST ORGANIZERS ON
THE PLANET, AND I'M SO PROUD OF
ALL THE CHANGE YOU'VE MADE POSSIBLE.
[CHEERS] TIME AND AGAIN, YOU'VE PICKED ME
UP. I HOPE, SOMETIMES, I PICKED YOU UP, TOO.
[CHEERS] AND TONIGHT, I ASK YOU TO DO FOR HILLARY CLINTON WHAT YOU DID FOR ME. I ASK YOU TO CARRY HER THE SAME WAY YOU CARRY ME. BECAUSE YOU'RE WHO I WAS TALKING ABOUT TWELVE YEARS AGO, WHEN I
TALKED ABOUT HOPE. IT'S BEEN YOU WHO'VE FUELED MY DOGGED FAITH IN OUR FUTURE, EVEN
WHEN THE ODDS ARE GREAT; EVEN
WHEN THE ROAD IS LONG. HOPE IN
THE FACE OF DIFFICULTY; HOPE IN
THE FACE OF UNCERTAINTY; THE
AUDACITY OF HOPE.
[CHEERS] AMERICA, YOU HAVE VINDICATED
THAT HOPE THESE PAST EIGHT
YEARS.
[CHEERS] AND NOW I'M READY TO PASS THE
BATON AND DO MY PART AS A
