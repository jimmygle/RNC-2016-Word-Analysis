<strong>Father William Byron</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> FRIENDS ALL, RECENT WEEKS
HAVE BROUGHT VIOLENCE AND SENSELESS KILLINGS TO THIS NATION, AND I'M THINKING IN
PARTICULAR OF BATON ROUGE AND DALLAS.
IT<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> JUST INTRIGUES ME THAT THE DALLAS ASSASSIN MORE THAN NAME MICA AND XAVIER. SO I'M GOING TO BORROW FROM THE WORDS OF THE PROPHET MICAH AND THE GREAT ST. FRANCIS XAVIER IN MAKING THIS INVOCATION.
LET'S BE MINDFUL THAT WE ARE IN
GOD'S PRESENCE AS WE PRAY. LORD GOD, CREATOR AND RULER OF THE UNIVERSE, WE INVOKE YOUR
BLESSING ON THIS ASSEMBLY, MINDFUL THAT YOU HOLD OUR DESTINY IN YOUR HANDS. LIFE ITSELF IS YOUR GIFT TO US.
WHAT WE DO WITH OUR LIVES IS OUR GIFT TO YOU. SO BLESS US, WE PRAY, AS WE LOOK
TO THE FUTURE OF THIS NATION.
KEEP US FREE FROM HATRED AND VIOLENCE.
PROTECT US FROM CONFUSION, AND
MAKE THE WORDS OF FRANCIS XAVIER OUR OWN, XAVIER WHO SAID, IN
YOU, LORD, HAVE I PUT MY HOPE. LET ME EVER BE CONFOUNDED. AND WE TURN TO YOUR GREAT PROFIT, MICAH, TO LISTEN TO YOU
SPEAK THE WORDS THAT HE PASSED
ON TO US.
YOU HAVE BEEN TOLD, OLD MAN, A WOMAN, WHAT IS GOOD, AND WHAT THE LORD REQUIRES A FEW, ONLY TO DO JUSTICE, TO LOVE GOODNESS, AND TO WALK HUMBLY WITH YOUR GOD
. SO HELP US, LORD, TO WORK UNCEASINGLY FOR JUSTICE, TO KNOW
WHAT IS GOOD, AND TO SEEK IT WITHOUT FAIL, AND TO BE TRULY HUMBLE AS WE WALK WITH YOU INTO AN UNKNOWN BUT HOPE FILLED FUTURE. AMEN.
