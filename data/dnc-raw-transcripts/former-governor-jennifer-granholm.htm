<p class='short_transcript'> >> DEMOCRATS!
[CHEERS] I WANT TO SPEAK TONIGHT TO THOSE
AMERICANS WHO FEEL YOU HAVE BEEN
LEFT BEHIND. THE AMERICANS WHO BELIEVE YOU HAVE BEEN CHEATED,<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> BELIEVE THAT
THOSE AT THE TOP DON'T CARE ABOUT YOU. I KNOW A LITTLE SOMETHING ABOUT THIS.
I WAS GOVERNOR OF MICHIGAN.
THE EPICENTER OF AMERICA'S MANUFACTURING RISE AND IT'S PAINFUL FALL AND ITS RESURGENCE. MICHIGAN BUILT THE AUTOMOBILE AND THE AUTOMOBILE BUILT
AMERICA. BUT WHEN THE MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY FELL ON HARD TIMES, SO DID MICHIGAN. SAID IT MANY OF YOUR STATES. WE WERE ANGRY ABOUT IT. ABOUT JOBS GOING TO LOW-WAGE COUNTRIES, ABOUT UNFAIR TRADE. WE WERE ALSO DETERMINED TO BUILD
THE INDUSTRY OF THE FUTURE.
WE SAID WE WANTED ADVANCED MANUFACTURING, YOU WANT TO DO
JOBS SO WE STARTED THIS PROCESS OF MOVING IN THAT DIRECTION AND THEN IN 2008, WE ELECTED A
DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENT TO WORK WITH US.
AND YOU KNOW WHAT HE DID, HE
SAVED THE AMERICAN AUTO
INDUSTRY.
[CHEERS] THAT REMOVED -- RENEWED AUTO
INDUSTRY PAID AMERICA BACK IN
FULL. THAT IS WHAT WE CAN DO TOGETHER. I, LIKE MANY OF YOU, AND A
FIERCE DEMOCRAT. BUT I KNOW THERE ARE DEMOCRATS
AND REPUBLICANS ALL ACROSS THIS
COUNTRY WHO WANT TO CREATE JOBS
IN AMERICA. LIBERALS AND CONSERVATIVES, PUBLIC SECTOR AND PRIVATE INDUSTRY BECAUSE WE ARE NOT IN THE SALON. WE ARE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER. ONE CANDIDATE GETS THAT AND ONE CANDIDATE, AS JOE BIDEN SAID LAST NIGHT, DOESN'T HAVE A CLUE. SOME PEOPLE ARE WORRIED. SOME PEOPLE ARE ANGRY.
I GET THAT. THE ANSWER IS NOT TO TEAR OUR COUNTRY DOWN, IT IS TO BUILD OUR
COUNTRY UP. NOT TO BUILD WALLS THAT KEEP OUT
THE REST OF THE WORLD, BUT TO
KEEP BUILDING THE INDUSTRIES AND UNIVERSITIES THAT THE REST OF
THE WORLD WISHES THEY COULD GET
INTO.
[CHEERS] HILLARY CLINTON GETS IT. AND THAT IS WHY SHE HAS HUGE
PLANS TO CREATE GOOD PAYING JOBS
IN AMERICA. IMAGINE THAT. ACTUAL PLANS. I MUST HAVE MISSED THAT NIGHT AT
THE REPUBLICAN CONVENTION.
[LAUGHTER] DETAILED PLANS FOR WRITTEN DOWN. NUMBER THAT ADD UP.
YOU WANT TO SEE THEM. YOU CAN ACTUALLY SEE THEM. JUST TEXT JOBS TO 47246. LAST WEEK WE HEARD ABOUT TRUMPS
HOPELESS VISION OF OUR COUNTRY. AND THEN HE SAID, I ALONE CAN
FIX IT. IMAGINE DONALD TRUMP'S PERSON OF
THE CONSTITUTION. IN ORDER TO FORM A MORE PERFECT UNION, OR CENTURIES LATER, I SHALL OVERCOME, OR ASK NOT WHAT
I CAN DO FOR MY COUNTRY, ASK WHAT MY COUNTRY CAN DO FOR ME.
[CHEERS] DONALD, YOU ARE SO VAIN.
[CHEERS] YOU PROBABLY THINK THE SPEECHES
ABOUT YOU.
-- SPEECH IS ABOUT YOU.
[CHEERS] HERE IS WHAT I KNOW, WE HAVE GOT
TO STOP DONALD TRUMP.
OUR GREAT COUNTRY STANDS -- SPANS A CONTINENT BUT WE ARE ALL
CONNECTED TO EACH OTHER NO
MATTER WHERE WE LIVE.
WHEN A MINOR IN VIRGINIA HAS THE
DIGNITY OF A NEW JOB IN THE ADVANCED STEEL INDUSTRY, WE ALL
HAVE DIGNITY. WHEN THE ENGINEERING STUDENT IN
THE SUNSHINE STATE BILLS THE
SOLAR PANELS OF THE FUTURE, WE
ALL SUCCEED.
WHEN THE AUTO WORKER IN DETROIT BILLS THE ELECTRIC VEHICLE THAT
DRAGS US FORWARD, WE ALL WIN.
[CHEERS] WHETHER YOU ARE IN MICHIGAN OR MARYLAND OR MISSOURI MONTANA.
[CHEERS] THIS, TOO, WHEN POINT WATER -- FLINT WATER POISONS ITS
CHILDREN, IT HURTS ALL OF US.
THESE ARE OUR CHILDREN. WE ARE ALL FLINT. RIGHT PHILADELPHIA?
[CHEERS] OUR NEXT PRESIDENT THAT A NATION
IS A VILLAGE, THAT WE ARE ONE FAMILY YET IN A FAMILY, NO ONE
GETS LEFT BEHIND. NOT THIS DEAL WORKER IN PENNSYLVANIA, NOT THE FARMER IN IOWA, NOT THE DREAMER IN NEVADA,
NOT A FACTORY WORKER IN OHIO. AS OUR NEXT PRESIDENT SAYS, WE
ARE STRONGER TOGETHER. WE ARE STRONGER HOW?</span><span class='hidden-full-transcript-ellipses'>...</span></p><a href='#' class='hidden-full-transcript-link'><i class='icon-chevron-down'></i> <span class='link-show-full-text'>Show Full Text</span><i class='icon-chevron-up'></i> <span class='link-show-less-text'>Show Less Text</span></a>
