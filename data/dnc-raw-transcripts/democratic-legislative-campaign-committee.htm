<strong>Tina Kotek</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> GOOD EVENING. I AM THE VICE CHAIR OF THE DEMOCRATIC LEGISLATIVE CAMPAIGN COMMITTEE AND SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE FROM THE GREAT STATE OF OREGON. CAN WE<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> MOVE THE -- FOR A SECOND? I WILL SAY THAT AGAIN.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AS THE FIRST LESBIAN SPEAKER OF ANY STATE HOUSE IN OUR NATION --

[CHEERS] THANK YOU. I HAVE PERSONALLY WITNESSED THE TREMENDOUS PROGRESS TOWARDS
EQUALITY AND JUSTICE FOR THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY.
WE HAVE COME SO FAR, AND WE CANNOT -- WE CANNOT GO BACK. I AM KNOWN FOR BEING SOMEONE WHO
TELLS IT LIKE IT IS. AND THE FACT IS I AM WITH HILLARY BECAUSE SHE IS WITH ME. HILLARY CLINTON UNDERSTANDS THAT THE WORK TO IMPROVE THE LIVES OF
EVERYDAY AMERICANS DOES NOT JUST
NEED TO HAPPEN IN WASHINGTON,
D.C. IT NEEDS TO HAPPEN IN STATE CAPITALS ALL ACROSS OUR COUNTRY. JUST LIKE HILLARY, OREGON DEMOCRATS AND DEMOCRATIC STATE
LEGISLATORS ACROSS THE COUNTRY ARE PROUD TO STAND UP FOR THE
HARD-WORKING PEOPLE WE REPRESENT. WE HAVE BEEN LEADING THE COUNTRY BY ADVANCING PROGRESSIVE POLICIES THAT LEVEL THE PLAYING
FIELD AND CREATE AN ECONOMY THAT
WORKS FOR ALL AMERICANS. FROM RAISING THEM WHENE MINIMUM WAGE
TO GUARANTEEING PAID FAMILY
MEDICAL LEAVE, TO ENDING RACIAL
PROFILING, DEMOCRATIC LEADERS IN
THE STATES ARE FIGHTING TO GET IT DONE. AND NOW WE NEED TO ELECT HILLARY CLINTON TO ENSURE THE PROGRESS
WE ARE MAKING IS NOT COMPROMISED BY RISKY, RECKLESS LEADERSHIP IN
THE OVAL OFFICE. FROM THE STATEHOUSE TO THE WHITE HOUSE, WE NEED LEADERS LIKE HILLARY CLINTON WHO WILL STAND
UP TO THE BULLIES WHO THREATEN FAIRNESS AND EQUALITY, WHO OFFER
REAL SOLUTIONS TO PUT WORKING FAMILIES FIRST, AND BUILT AN ECONOMY THAT GIVES EVERYONE A FAIR SHOT AT SUCCESS. HILLARY CLINTON IS OUR ANSWER TO
INTOLERANCE AND FEAR. AND I HAVE HER BACK BECAUSE I KNOW SHE STANDS WITH ALL OF US. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.</span><span class='hidden-full-transcript-ellipses'>...</span></p><a href='#' class='hidden-full-transcript-link'><i class='icon-chevron-down'></i> <span class='link-show-full-text'>Show Full Text</span><i class='icon-chevron-up'></i> <span class='link-show-less-text'>Show Less Text</span></a>

<strong>Kevin de Leon</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> THANK YOU, TINA, AND THANK YOU FOR WHAT YOU DO FOR THE GREAT STATE OF OREGON. FRIENDS, I AM SENATE PRESIDENT FROM THE GREAT STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> AM WITH HILLARY BECAUSE SHE HAS SPENT A LIFETIME FIGHTING FOR FAMILIES JUST LIKE MINE. AS THE SON OF A SINGLE IMMIGRANT MOTHER WITH A THIRD GRADE EDUCATION, I KNOW HOW
IMPORTANT THE WORK AT THE STATE CAPITAL CAN BE. WE OPEN DOORS OF OPPORTUNITIES TO HARD-WORKING AMERICANS WHO DO
NOT HAVE THE LUXURY OF A FAMILY INHERITANCE OR EIGHTH AGREED -- PEDIGREED NAME.
DEMOCRATS IN CALIFORNIA HAVE LED
THE WAY BY RAISING THE MINIMUM WAGE, EXPANDING AFFORDABLE CHILDCARE, ESTABLISHING THE
DREAM ACT THAT KEEPS FAMILIES TOGETHER, KEEPING COLLEGE AFFORDABLE, AND CREATING MORE THAN 500,000 CLEAN ENERGY JOBS THROUGH OUR LANDMARK CLIMATE LAWS.
WE HAVE MADE UNPRECEDENTED PROGRESS IN EVERY AREA AND WHEN WE ELECT HILLARY CLINTON AS THE NEXT PRESIDENT, I KNOW OUR PROGRESS WON'T TO BE AMERICA'S
-- WON'T BE AMERICA'S PROGRESS. THESE OTHER PROGRESSIVE POLICIES
-- THIS IS HOW DEMOCRATS GOVERN
AND WHEN DEMOCRATS LEAD,
EVERYONE HAS A SHOT TO SUCCEED. NOT BY SHOUTING BOMBASTIC RHETORIC INTO THE MICROPHONE,
BUT BY TAKING BOLD, INTENTIONAL POLICIES AND IMPLEMENTING THEM AND IGNITING INNOVATION THAT LEAVES NO ONE BEHIND.
THAT IS HOW YOU IMPROVE THE HUMAN CONDITION. DEMOCRATS DO NOT ALIENATE, ISOLATE, EXCLUDE, OR DEMONIZE. AND WE DO NOT MANUFACTURE FEAR. THAT IS A SIGN OF WEAKNESS. WE LOOK TO SOLVE INEQUALITY, IN POWER THE FORGOTTEN AND OVERLOOKED AND EXPAND THE
WINNERS CIRCLE FOR EVERYONE IRRESPECTIVE OF WHO YOU ARE,
WHERE YOU COME FROM, THE LANGUAGE YOU SPEAK. WE FIGHT FOR EQUAL PAY FOR ALL WOMEN BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT AN ECONOMY WORKS BETTER WHEN WE ALL WORK TOGETHER. FRIENDS, WE ARE ALL DEMOCRATS. MORE IMPORTANTLY, WE ARE
AMERICANS. I GOT A MESSAGE FOR DONALD J. TRUMP.
[SPEAKING SPANISH] WE DO NOT BUILD WALLS HERE. WE TEAR THEM DOWN.

<strong>Stacey Abrams</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> I AM STACY ABRAMS AND I JOIN
YOU TODAY FROM THE GREAT STATE
OF GEORGIA. I AM HONORED TO LEAD THE DEMOCRATS IN THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. GROWING<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> UP AS THE DAUGHTER OF A LIBRARIAN AND A SHIPYARD WORKER
IN SOUTHERN MISSISSIPPI, MY FAMILY WAS HIT BY THE ECONOMIC INSECURITY THAT IS TOO OFTEN
DRIVEN BY RACISM, SEXISM, AND THE ILLS THAT COME FROM BEING BORN IN THE WRONG ZIP CODE. MY PARENTS TAUGHT ALL SIX OF THEIR CHILDREN, CELEBRATE THROUGH SERVICE THE GREAT THAT
IS AMERICA. TO UNDERSTAND THAT NO MATTER HOW
LITTLE WE MAY HAVE HAD, THERE WAS ALWAYS SOMEONE WITH LESS AND IT WAS OUR JOB TO SERVE THAT PERSON, TO KNOW THAT EVEN THE MOST POWERFUL AMONG US, THE STRONGEST AMONG US DID NOT RISE UP ALONE.
NO MATTER WHERE WE START, WE ALL
NEED HELP. WE ALL NEED OPPORTUNITY. WHEN WE SUCCEED, WITH US FOR TOGETHER -- WE PROSPER TOGETHER. IT CHANGES THE LIVES OF OUR FAMILIES, COMMUNITIES, OUR COUNTRY.
HILLARY CLINTON UNDERSTANDS THAT GOVERNMENT AT ALL LEVELS IS A FOUND EXPRESSION -- PROFOUND
EXPRESSION OF OUR COMMON
HUMANITY AND SHARED VALUES, OF
OUR ASPIRATIONS, NOT OUR FEARS. THAT IS WHY I AM SO VERY PROUD
TO STAND WITH THIS REMARKABLE WOMAN WITH A THOUSAND FELLOW STATE LEGISLATORS AND EACH OF YOU AS WE ELECT HILLARY TO BE
THE 46TH PRESIDENT OF THESE
UNITED STATES. I AM HERE TODAY AS PART OF A NEW AMERICAN MAJORITY, ONE THAT HAS THE COURAGE TO WORK TOGETHER
RATHER THAN TEAR OUR NATION
APART. WE ARE THE ARCHITECTS OF SOLUTION TO HELP FAMILIES RAISE HEALTHY CHILDREN AND MAKE A LIVING WAGE WEATHER THAN CRIPPLING OUR ECONOMIC FUTURE --
RATHER THAN CRIPPLING OUR ECONOMIC FUTURE. WE FIGHT FOR MORE BECAUSE THAT IS WHO WE ARE. THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY IS THE PARTY OF CIVIL RIGHTS AND HUMAN RIGHTS, WE WILL ALWAYS BE THE
PARTY OF PROGRESS AND INCLUSION
AND WE WILL NOT ALLOW THE
COUNTRY TO RETURN TO AN ERA OF
DISCRIMINATION. WE WILL ELECT HILLARY CLINTON, A LEADER WHO SEES THE FUTURE AND
RACES TOWARD IT FEARLESS AND BOLD BECAUSE AMERICA IS AND WILL ALWAYS BE STRONGER TOGETHER. THANK YOU.
