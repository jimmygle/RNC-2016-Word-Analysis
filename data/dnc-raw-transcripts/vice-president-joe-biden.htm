<strong>Jill Biden</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> THANK YOU. THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU. I LOVE YOU.
[CHEERS] LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THANK YOU,
THANK YOU.
[CHEERS] I LOVE YOU. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> EIGHT YEARS AGO, I STOOD ON THE STAGE IN DENVER.
[CHEERS] AND I ACCEPTED YOUR NOMINATION TO BE VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.
[CHEERS] AND EVERY SINGLE DAY SINCE THEN,
IT HAS BEEN THE HONOR OF OUR LIVES FOR JOE AND ME, EVERY DAY
WE HAVE BEEN GRATEFUL FOR BROCK AND MICHELLE -- BARACK AND MICHELLE JOINING THEM ON THE
INCREDIBLE JOURNEY.
[CHEERS] A JOURNEY THAT CAN ONLY HAPPEN IN AMERICA.
[CHEERS] WE NOT ONLY HAVE WORKED TOGETHER, AS IT HAS BECOME
OBVIOUS, WE HAVE BECOME FRIENDS. WE ARE NOW FAMILY.
[CHEERS] WHERE FAMILY.
-- WE ARE FAMILY.
[CHEERS] YOU HAVE ALL SEEN OVER THE LAST EIGHT YEARS WHAT PRESIDENT OBAMA MEANS TO THIS COUNTRY.
[CHEERS] HE IS THE EMBODIMENT OF HONOR, RESOLVE AND CHARACTER. ONE OF THE FINEST PRESIDENTS WE
HAVE EVER HAD.
[CHEERS] THAT IS RIGHT.
[CHEERS] THIS IS A MAN OF CHARACTER.
[CHEERS] HE HAS BECOME A BROTHER TO JILL AND ME.
AND MICHELLE, YOU ARE
INCREDIBLE.
[CHEERS] YOU ARE INCREDIBLE!
[CHEERS] I WAS TALKING TO BROCK TODAY, IT IS NO LONGER HE WILL GIVE THE
BEST SPEECH, WE KNOW WHO DID
THAT.
YOU ARE INCREDIBLE MONDAY NIGHT.
-- WERE INCREDIBLE MONDAY NIGHT.
[CHEERS] THE DELAWARE DELEGATION, AS THEY SAY, BARACK AND I MARRIED WAY UP.
[CHEERS] AS I STAND HERE TONIGHT, I SEE
SO MANY FRIENDS AND COLLEAGUES LIKE MY BUDDY CHRIS DODD FROM THE CONNECTICUT DELEGATION.
SO MANY PEOPLE HERE. I SEE THE FACES OF THOSE WHO
HAVE PLACED THEIR BELIEF IN
BARACK AND ME. SO MANY FACES. BUT ONE, THIS IS KIND OF A BETTER SWEET MOMENT FOR JAIL AND ME AND OUR FAMILY. IN 2008, WHEN HE WAS ABOUT TO DO
PLAY TO A AGAIN IN 2012, OUR SON
THOUGH -- BO INTRODUCED ME TO THE COUNTRY AND PLACE MY NAME
AND NOMINATION. SUSAN: YOU GOT A GLIMPSE OF WHAT
AN INCREDIBLY FINE YOUNG MAN BEAU WAS.
[CHEERS] THANK YOU.
[CHEERS] THANK YOU.
[CHEERS] HIS WIFE AND HIS TWO KIDS ARE
HERE TONIGHT.
[CHEERS] AS ERNEST HEMINGWAY ONCE WROTE,
THE WORLD BREAKS EVERYONE, AND AFTERWARDS, MANY ARE STRONG AT
THE BROKEN PLACES.
I'VE BEEN MADE STRONG AT THE BROKEN PLACES BY MY LOVE WITH JILL, BUT MY HEART AND SON
HUNTER AND THE LOVE OF MY LIFE,
MY ASHLEY. BY ALL OF YOU, AND I MEAN THIS SINCERELY, THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN
THROUGH THIS, YOU KNOW I MEAN
WHAT I SAY, I ALL OF YOU, -- BY
ALL OF YOU, YOUR LOVE AND
PRAYERS AND SUPPORT, YOU KNOW WHAT, WE TALK ABOUT, WE THINK
ABOUT THE COUNTLESS THOUSANDS OF OTHER PEOPLE WHO SUFFERED SO MUCH MORE THAN WE HAVE, WITH SO
MUCH LESS SUPPORT. SO MUCH LESS REASON TO GO ON. BUT THEY GET UP EVERY MORNING, EVERY DAY.
[CHEERS] THEY PUT ONE FOOT IN FRONT OF
THE OTHER, THEY KEEP GOING. THAT IS THE UNBREAKABLE SPIRIT
OF THE PEOPLE OF AMERICA.
[CHEERS] THAT IS WHO WE ARE.
[CHEERS] THAT IS WHO WE ARE. DON'T FORGET IT. LIKE THE PEOPLE OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD THAT JOE AND I GREW
UP, -- JILL AND I GREW UP, THE
KID IN CLAYMONT, THE MOST KURDS ALWAYS JUMPED AND WHEN YOU ARE
DOUBLE TEAMED OR YOUR BACK WAS
AGAINST THE WALL.
BECAME A COP BECAUSE HE ALWAYS
WANTED TO HELP PEOPLE. THE MIDDLE DAUGHTER OF THREE DAUGHTERS, WHO ALWAYS MADE HER MOTHER SMILE, WHO IS A HERO TO
HER SISTERS. NOW I MAJOR IN THE UNITED STATES MARINE CORPS BECAUSE I WANTED TO
SERVE MY COUNTRY.
[CHEERS] THE TEACHERS WHO JILL KNOWS WHO
TAKE MONEY OUT OF THEIR OWN
POCKETS TO BUY PENCILS AND NOTEBOOKS FOR THEIR STUDENTS WHO
CAN'T AFFORD THEM.
[CHEERS] WHY? BECAUSE BEING A TEACHER IS NOT WHAT THEY DO, IT IS WHO THEY ARE
.
[CHEERS] YOU KNOW WHAT I KNOW, FOR REAL. THESE ARE THE PEOPLE THAT THE
HEART AND SOUL OF THIS COUNTRY.
IT IS THE AMERICA THAT I KNOW. THE AMERICA THAT HILLARY KNOWS
AND TIM KAINE KNOWS.
[CHEERS] I'VE KNOWN HILLARY FOR WELL OVER 30 YEARS, BEFORE SHE WAS FIRST LADY OF THE UNITED STATES, WHEN SHE BECAME FIRST LADY, WE SERVED TOGETHER IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE AND DURING HER YEARS AS
SECRETARY OF STATE, ONCE A WEEK
WE HAD BREAKFAST IN MY HOME, THE
VICE PRESIDENT'S RESIDENCE. EVERYBODY KNOWS SHE IS SMART.
EVERYONE KNOWS SHE IS TOUGH. BUT I KNOW WHAT SHE IS
PASSIONATE ABOUT.
[CHEERS] I KNOW HILLARY.
[CHEERS] HILLARY UNDERSTANDS, HILLARY
GETS IT. SHE UNDERSTANDS THE COLLEGE
LOANS ARE ABOUT A LOT MORE THAN GETTING A QUALIFIED STUDENT
EDUCATION. IT IS ABOUT SAVING THE MOM AND
DAD FROM THE INDIGNITY OF HAVING
TO LOOK AT THE CHILD AND
SAY I'M SORRY, THE BANK WOULD
NOT LET US THE MONEY.
I CAN HELP YOU GET TO SCHOOL.
I KNOW THAT ABOUT HILLARY. HILLARY UNDERSTOOD THAT FOR YEARS, MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WENT
TO BED STARING AT THE SCALING -- CEILING THINKING WHAT IF I GET
BREAST CANCER OR HE HAS A HEART
ATTACK?
I WILL LOSE EVERYTHING. WHAT WILL WE DO THEN?
I KNOW ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON.
[CHEERS] LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WE ALL UNDERSTAND WHAT IT WILL MEAN FOR
OUR DAUGHTERS AND GRANDDAUGHTERS
WHEN HILLARY CLINTON WALKS INTO
THE OVAL OFFICE AS PRESIDENT OF
THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.
[CHEERS] IT WILL CHANGE THEIR LIVES.
[CHEERS] MY DAUGHTER AND GRANDDAUGHTERS CAN DO ANYTHING ANY SON OR GRANDSON CAN DO AND SHE WILL PROVE IT, MR. MAYOR.
[CHEERS] LET ME SAY THIS AS CLEARLY AS I CAN, IF YOU LIVE IN THE NEIGHBORHOODS LIKE THE ONES JILL
AND I GREW UP IN, IF YOU WORRY ABOUT YOUR JOB AND GETTING A
DECENT PAY, IF YOU WORRY ABOUT
YOUR CHILDREN'S EDUCATION, IF
YOU ARE TAKING CARE OF AN ELDERLY PARENT, THEN THERE IS ONLY ONE PERSON IN THE SELECTION WILL HELP YOU, ONLY ONE PERSON
IN THIS RACE WHO WILL BE THERE, WHO HAS ALWAYS BEEN THERE FOR YOU AND THAT IS HILLARY CLINTON'S LIFE STORY.
NOT JUST WHO SHE IS, IT IS HER
LIFE STORY.
[CHEERS] SHE IS ALWAYS THERE. SHE HAS ALWAYS BEEN THERE.
[CHEERS] AND SO HAS TIM KAINE.
[CHEERS] LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, LET'S SAY THE OBVIOUS, I REALLY MEANT,
THAT IS NOT DONALD TRUMP STORY. JUST LISTEN TO ME A SECOND
WITHOUT DOING OR CHEERING.
-- BOOING OR CHEERING, HIS CYNICISM IS UNDOUBTEDLY HIS LACK
OF EMPATHY AND COMPASSION CAN BE
SUMMED UP IN THAT PHRASE HE IS
MOST PROUD OF MAKING FAMOUS, YOU'RE FIRED. I'M NOT JOKING.
THINK ABOUT THAT. THINK ABOUT THAT. THINK ABOUT EVERYTHING YOU
LEARNED AS A CHILD. NO MATTER WHERE YOU WERE RAISED,
HOW CAN THERE BE PLEASURE IN SAYING YOU'RE FIRED? HE IS TRYING TO TELL US HE CARES
ABOUT THE MIDDLE CLASS. GIVE ME A BREAK. THAT IS A BUNCH OF MALARKEY.
[CHEERS] WHATEVER HE THINKS, WHATEVER HE THINKS, AND I MEAN IS FROM THE
BOTTOM OF MY HEART, I KNOW I'M
CALLED MIDDLE-CLASS JOE AND IN WASHINGTON, THAT IS NOT MEANT AS A COMPLIMENT. IT MEANS YOU ARE NOT
SOPHISTICATED.
I KNOW WHY WE ARE STRONG, I KNOW WHY WE ARE HELD TOGETHER, I KNOW
WHY WE ARE UNITED, IT IS BECAUSE THERE HAS ALWAYS BEEN A GROWING MIDDLE CLASS.
THIS GUY DOES NOT HAVE A CLUE ABOUT THE MIDDLE CLASS. NOT A CLUE.
[CHEERS] BECAUSE FOLKS, WHEN THE HILL CLASS -- MIDDLE CLASS DOES WELL,
THE RICH DO VERY WELL AND THE
POOR HAVE HOPE. THEY HAVE A WAY OUT.
HE HAS NO CLUE ABOUT WHAT MAKES
AMERICA GREAT. ACTUALLY, HE HAS NO CLUE PERIOD.
[CHEERS]
>> NOT A CLUE! NOT A CLUE! NOT A CLUE!
>> FOLKS, LET ME SAY, LET ME SAY SOMETHING THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH POLITICS. LET ME TALK ABOUT SOMETHING THAT
I'M DEADLY SERIOUS ABOUT. THIS IS A COMPLICATED AND UNCERTAIN WORLD WE LIVE IN. THE THREATS ARE TWO GREAT -- TOO GREAT, THE TIMES ARE TOO
UNCERTAIN TO ELECT DONALD TRUMP AS RESIDENT OF THE UNITED
STATES.
LET ME FINISH, NO MAJOR PARTY,
NO MAJOR PARTY NOMINEE IN THE
HISTORY OF THE STATION HAS EVER KNOWN LESS OR BEEN LESS PREPARED
TO DO WITH OUR NATIONAL SECURITY
-- DEAL WITH OUR NATIONAL
SECURITY. WE CANNOT ELECT A MAN WHO
EXPLOITS OUR FEARS OF ISIS AND
OTHER TERRORISTS, WHO HAS NO PLAN WHATSOEVER TO MAKE A SAFER. A MAN WHO EMBRACES THE TACTICS
OF OUR ENEMIES, TORTURE, RELIGIOUS INTOLERANCE, YOU ALL KNOW. OTHER REPUBLICANS NO, THAT IS NOT WHO WE ARE. IT BETRAYS OUR VALUES. IT ALIENATES THOSE WHO WE NEED
IN THE FIGHT AGAINST ISIS. DONALD TRUMP, WITH ALL HIS RHETORIC WOULD LITERALLY MAKE US
LESS SAFE.
WE CANNOT ELECT A MAN WHO
BELITTLES OUR CLOSEST ALLIES
WHILE EMBRACING DICTATORS LIKE
VLADIMIR PUTIN. I MEAN IT.
[CHEERS] A MAN WHO SEEKS TO GO -- SOW
DIVISION IN AMERICA FOR HIS OWN GAIN AND DISORDER AROUND THE
WORLD.
A MAN WHO CONFUSES BLUSTER WITH
STRENGTH. WE SIMPLY CANNOT LET THAT HAPPEN AS AMERICANS.
[CHEERS] PERIOD.
[CHEERS] FOLKS --
[CHEERS] I HAVE, WHATEVER DOUBTS I MEAN
WHAT I SAY.
BUT SOMETIMES I SAY ALL THAT I
MEAN. LET ME TELL YOU WHAT I LITERALLY TELL EVERYONE LEADER I'VE MET
WITH.
AND I MET THEM ALL, IT IS NEVER,
NEVER, NEVER BEEN A GOOD BET AGAINST AMERICA.
[CHEERS] WE HAVE THE FINEST FIGHTING
FORCE IN THE WORLD. NOT ONLY --
[CHEERS] NOT ONLY DO WE HAVE THE LARGEST
ECONOMY IN THE WORLD, WE HAVE
THE STRONGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD.
[CHEERS] WE HAVE THE MOST PRODUCTIVE
WORKERS IN THE WORLD. AND GIVE IT A FAIR SHOT. GIVEN A FAIR CHANCE. AMERICANS HAVE NEVER, EVER, EVER, EVER, EVER LET THE COUNTRY DOWN.
[CHEERS] NEVER!
[CHEERS] ORDINARY PEOPLE LIKE US, WHO DO EXTRAORDINARY THINGS, WE HAD CANDIDATES BEFORE ATTEMPTING GET
ELECTED BY APPEALING TO OUR FEARS, BUT THEY'VE NEVER SUCCEEDED BECAUSE WE DO NOT
SCARE EASILY. WE NEVER BOW, WE NEVER BREAK,
WHEN CONFRONTED WITH CRISIS. WE ENDURE! WE OVERCOME AND WE ALWAYS MOVE FORWARD.
[CHEERS] THAT IS WHY.
[CHEERS] THAT IS WHY I CAN SAY, WITHOUT SALUTE -- ABSOLUTE CONVICTION THAT I AM MORE OPTIMISTIC ABOUT OUR CHANCES TODAY THAN WHEN I WAS ELECTED AS A 29-YEAR-OLD KID
TO THE SENATE. THE 21ST CENTURY IS GOING TO BE
THE AMERICAN CENTURY.
[CHEERS] BECAUSE WE LEAD NOT ONLY BY
EXAMPLE OF OUR POWER, BUT BY THE POWER OF OUR EXAMPLE.
[CHEERS] THAT IS THE HISTORY OF THE
JOURNEY OF AMERICANS.
AND GOD WILLING, HILLARY CLINTON WILL WRITE THE NEXT CHAPTER IN
THAT JOURNEY. WE ARE AMERICA, SECOND TO NONE,
AND WE OWNED THE FINISH LINE -- OWN THE FINISH LINE!
DON'T FORGET IT!
[CHEERS] GOD BLESS YOU ALL AND[CHEERS] GOD PROTECT OUR TROOPS!
