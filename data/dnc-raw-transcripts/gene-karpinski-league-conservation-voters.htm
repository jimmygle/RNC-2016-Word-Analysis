<p class='short_transcript'> >> THANK YOU. THE QUESTION WAS SIMPLE. MEGAN ANDRE, A STUDENT AT THE
UNIVERSITY OF NEW HAMPSHIRE,
ASKED DONALD TRUMP ABOUT HIS
PLAN TO FIGHT CLIMATE CHANGE.<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> TRUMP MARKP MOCKED HER, LIKE YOU
MOCKED SO MANY OTHERS. BUT FOLKS, CLIMATE CHANGE IS NO
JOKE. FROM FLOODS IN MIAMI TO DRESS IN CALIFORNIA TO WILDFIRES IN COLORADO, RISING SEA LEVELS IN
VIRGINIA, HEAT WAVES ACROSS THE COUNTRY, IT IS CLEAR -- CLIMATE
CHANGE IS HERE, AND IT IS HAVING
DEVASTATING IMPACT. I'M THE PRESIDENT OF THE LEAGUE OF CONSERVATION VOTERS. OUR TOP PRIORITY THIS YEAR IS
ELECTING HILLARY CLINTON THE
NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.

>> THE STAKES COULD NOT BE HIGHER. CLIMATE CHANGE IS HAPPENING NOW,
THE DONALD TRUMP, CALLS IT AND I
QUOTE, "A HOAX." AND MORE<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> THAN THAT, MORE THAN JUST THAT, HIS POLICIES WOULD
MAKE CLIMATE CHANGE WORSE. HIS ENERGY PLAN WOULD MEAN MORE POLLUTION IN THE AIR, OR POISON IN THE WATER, AND MORE PUBLIC
LAND STRIPPED FOR PRIVATE
PROPERTY. THAT MAY BE GOOD FOR THE KOCH BROTHERS AND GOOD FOR EXXON AND
GOOD FOR BIG OIL, BUT HIS
POLICIES WOULD BE TERRIBLE FOR
OUR FAMILIES AND OUR FUTURE.
THAT IS WHY TODAY, WE ARE NAMING DONALD TRUMP ON OUR DIRTY DOZEN LIST, DIRTY, DANGEROUS, DENYING
DONALD. I CAN'T IMAGINE ANYONE MORE DESERVING. IT IS WHY WE MUST ELECT HILLARY CLINTON AND TIM KAINE AS OUR NEXT PRESIDENT AND VICE
PRESIDENT. YOU KNOW, WE PROBABLY ENDORSED
HILLARY LAST NOVEMBER, THE
EARLIEST PRESIDENTIAL ENDORSEMENT IN OUR HISTORY. WHY? BECAUSE HILLARY IS A PROVEN LEADER WITH A VISION AND A PLAN TO COMBAT CLIMATE CHANGE AND MAKE CLEAN ENERGY, AMERICA THE
CLEAN ENERGY SUPERPOWER OF THE
21ST CENTURY. THAT IS WHAT WE NEED. HER SOLUTIONS ARE WIND, WIND,
WIND, WIND, WIND. GOOD FOR OUR ECONOMY, FOR OUR SECURITY, FOR OUR HEALTH, AND
FOR OUR PLANET. AND SHE IS NOT JUST A LEADER ON
CLIMATE CHANGE AND CLEAN ENERGY. SHE CALLS ATTENTION TO THE
DRINKING WATER CRISIS IN FLINT,
MICHIGAN. SHE KEEPS AMBITIOUS PLANS TO
REBUILD AGING INFRASTRUCTURE AND
FIGHT FOR JUSTICE. THIS  NOVEMBER, THE QUESTION IS
SIMPLE. ARE WE GOING TO PROTECT PROFIT OR PROTECT PUBLIC HEALTH? ARE WE GOING TO GO BACKWARDS ON
OUR POLICIES ARE CONTINUE GOING
FORWARD? ARE WE GOING TO ELECT A CLIMATE DENIER OR A CLIMATE CHAMPION? WE ARE STRONGER TOGETHER. LET'S SHOW MEGAN AND MILLIONS OF
PEOPLE LIKE HER THAT WE ARE
FIGHTING FOR THEIR FUTURE. WAS ACT ON CLIMATE AND ELECT
HILLARY CLINTON.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.</span><span class='hidden-full-transcript-ellipses'>...</span></p><a href='#' class='hidden-full-transcript-link'><i class='icon-chevron-down'></i> <span class='link-show-full-text'>Show Full Text</span><i class='icon-chevron-up'></i> <span class='link-show-less-text'>Show Less Text</span></a>
