<strong>Al Franken</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> HELLO, EVERYBODY.
[CHEERING] SAVE IT FOR THE END.
[CHEERING] I'M AL FRANKEN.
[CHEERING] FROM MINNESOTA.
[CHEERING] SENATOR AND WORLD-RENOWNED EXPERT<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> ON RIGHT-WING
MEGALOMANIACS.
[CHEERING] RUSH LIMBAUGH, BILL O'REILLY,
AND NOW DONALD TRUMP. A LITTLE ABOUT MY
QUALIFICATIONS, I GOT MY DOCTORATE IN MEGALOMANIA STUDIES
FROM TRUMP UNIVERSITY.
[LAUGHTER] SURE, I HAD TO EMPTY OUT MY 401(K) AND TAKE A REVERSE
MORTGAGE ON MY HOUSE TO PAY TUITION, BUT MR. TRUMP, OR
RATHER SOME PEOPLE WHO SAY THEY
ONCE MET HIM, CONVINCED ME THAT IT WAS WORTH IT. AND FRANKLY, AS A PROUD ALUM OF TRUMP UNIVERSITY, I THINK WE MAY BE UNDERESTIMATING DONALD TRUMP. SURE HE SCANNED THE LOSS OF PEOPLE, WHAT DID YOU KNOW THAT TRUMP UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF
GROUPING PEOPLE OFF HIS RIGHT NATION -- SECOND IN THE NATION? RIGHT BEHIND BERNIE MADOFF UNIVERSITY.
[LAUGHTER] THAT IS NO MEAN THE.
-- FEAT.
TRUMP UNIVERSITY IS ABOUT MORE THAN JUST MILKING PEOPLE.
ALTHOUGH TRUST ME, YOU WILL GET MILKED. IT IS ALSO ABOUT LEARNING
DIRECTLY FROM SUCCESS EXPERTS.
LIKE SCOTTDALE -- SCOTT BAI, MIKE TYSON, AND OF COURSE A
LIFETIME -- LIFE-SIZE CARDBOARD
CUTOUT OF MR. TRUMP HIMSELF. OF COURSE, DUMB COME WOULD NOT
BE DONALD TRUMP WITHOUT HIS IS
THE SCHOOL.
-- BUSINESS SCHOOL.
THEIR BREAKUPS THE PROGRAM -- BANKRUPT THE PROGRAM IS KNOWN THROUGHOUT THE REAL ESTATE
COMMUNITY FOR ITS CREATIVITY. THE MOST POPULAR COURSE, BANKRUPTCY 101, HOW TO LEAVE
YOUR PARTNERS HOLDING THE BAG. IT IS TAUGHT BY THE CARDBOARD CUTOUT HIMSELF. THE PRIDE OF TRUMP UNIVERSITY, OF COURSE, IS HIS LIBRARY. LOCATED ON A SHELF AND A CLOSET
ON THE THIRD FLOOR OF TRUMP
TOWER. ALL OF DONALD TRUMP'S BEST SELLERS ARE AVAILABLE FOR SALE
AT A SPECIAL RATE, FOR STUDENTS
WHICH IS 10% HIGHER THAN THE
RETAIL PRICE. CLEARLY, DONALD TRUMP'S
ENORMOUS, DARE I SAY HUUUGE
SUCCESS AS A BUSINESSMAN
QUALIFIES HIM TO BE PRESIDENT
AND IF YOU BELIEVE THAT, I HAVE SOME DELICIOUS TRUMP STEAKS TO SELL YOU.
[CHEERING] IN ALL SERIOUSNESS, I THINK
RATHER THAN VOTING FOR SOMEONE
WHO HAS NEVER DONE ANYTHING FOR
ANYONE OTHER THAN HIMSELF, MAYBE
WE SHOULD GO WITH A CANDIDATE WHO SPENT HER ENTIRE LIFE WORKING TO GET IMPORTANT THINGS DONE TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.
[CHEERING] I'VE KNOWN HILLARY FOR ALMOST A QUARTER-CENTURY. I'VE NEVER MET ANYONE SMARTER, TOUGHER OR MORE READY TO LEAD US
FORWARD.
[CHEERING] I AM PROUD TO CALL HILLARY
CLINTON MY FRIEND AND I CAN'T
WAIT TO CALL HER MADAM PRESIDENT.
[CHEERING] NOW, WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A LOT
OF FUN THIS WEEK. WE WILL HAVE A LOT OF FUN. WHEN WE WAKE UP MONDAY MORNING,
THERE WILL BE JUST 102 DAYS LEFT
UNTIL THE ELECTION AND WHAT YOU,
ALL OF YOU, WHAT YOU DO IN THOSE 102 DAYS TO DETERMINE WHO WINS. AND I MEAN THAT LITERALLY.
I WON MY FIRST RACE FOR SENATE
BY 312 VOTES. WHERE IS MY MINNESOTA
DELEGATION?
[CHEERING] THERE ARE PEOPLE UP THERE WHO CONTACTED MORE THAN 312 PEOPLE THEMSELVES AND LITERALLY I WOULD NOT BE HERE. THE REASON I'M GIVING THE SPEECH HERE AND NOT INTO MY BATHROOM MIRROR.
[CHEERING] MY FRIENDS, MY FRIEND PAUL WELLSTONE --
[CHEERING] MY FRIEND USED TO SAY THAT THE FUTURE BELONGS TO THOSE WHO ARE
PASSIONATE AND WORK HARD. THIS WEEK IS ABOUT PASSION, BUT
STARTING FRIDAY MORNING, IT IS
ALL ABOUT WORK, HARD WORK.
[CHEERING] MANY OF YOU HAVE JOBS, MANY OF YOU HAVE FAMILY. IGNORE THEM.
[CHEERING] LET ME TELL YOU SOME BECOME A
KIDS LOVE IT WHEN THEIR PARENTS ARE NOT HOME. LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING ELSE,
AN EIGHT-YEAR-OLD KID KNOWS HOW
TO USE A MICROWAVE OVEN. AND LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING
ELSE, AN EIGHT-YEAR-OLD KID CAN
TEACH A FOUR-YEAR-OLD KID TO USE
A MICROWAVE ONION.
-- ROBIN.
IT IS SCIENTIFIC FACT. DON'T WORRY ABOUT YOUR KIDS,
THEY WILL BE FINE.
YOU HAVE WORK TO DO. GET ON THOSE FUNDS, -- BONES,
TALK ON THE DOORS.
TELL THEM AL FRANKEN CENTURY.
-- SENT YOU.
THANK YOU.
[CHEERING]
