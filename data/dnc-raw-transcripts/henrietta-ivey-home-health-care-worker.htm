<strong>Unidentified Speaker</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> MY NAME IS HENRIETTA IVEY AND
I'M A DETROIT HOME CARE WORKER.
I'M A MOTHER OF FOUR AND A PROUD
MOTHER OF SEVEN. GRANDCHILDREN. I AM BLESSED TO DO THE<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> WORK I BELIEVE IN, KEEPING FAMILIES IN THEIR HOMES AND CARING FOR
PEOPLE IN NEED. EVEN AS I WORK MY FIGURE TO THE BONE, I DON'T ALWAYS FEEL THE SUPPORT I NEED FROM THE LEADERS
I'M SUPPOSED TO TRUST. WORK TWO JOBS AT MINIMUM WAGE
AND CAN BARELY MAKE ENDS MEET. I REMEMBER LOOKING AT MY BABY'S DAYS AS AN FIGHTING BACK TEARS
BECAUSE I ALWAYS TAUGHT THEM TO
DREAM BIG BUT I DID NOT ALWAYS
KNOW IF I WOULD BE ABLE TO LIVE THESE DREAMS. WHEN I FIRST MET HILLARY CLINTON, WE CONNECTED RIGHT AWAY
AND AS MOTHERS AND PEOPLE WHO LET LIFE -- LEAD LIVES OF SERVICE, I KNOW SHE WILL FIGHT
TO RAISE MINIMUM WAGE. IN MICHIGAN, WE ARE FIGHTING FOR 15.
[CHEERS] A $15 MINIMUM WAGE BECAUSE
NETWORKING AMERICAN FAMILY
SHOULD BE FORCED TO LIVE IN POVERTY.
[CHEERS] I SEE MYSELF IN HER AND I BELIEVE SHE SEES HERSELF AND ME.
[CHEERS] I BELIEVE HER STEADY HAND IN THE
OVAL OFFICE WILL HAVE PEOPLE LIKE ME READ EASIER -- BREATHE EASIER AND ACHIEVE MORE.
THAT MAKES THE SELECTION BIGGER THAN POLITICS. FOR ME AND ALL HOME CARE WORKERS
ACROSS THE NATION, AND MY FAMILY, THIS IS PERSONAL.
[CHEERS] I KNOW HILLARY CLINTON HAS ARE BACK AND WE WILL HAVE HERS. THANKS TO. THROUGHOUT THE BOOK -- GO OUT
AND VOTE NOVEMBER 8, AND GOD
BLESS YOU ALL.

<strong>Unidentified Speaker</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> BY GENERATIONS OF AMERICANS,
I'VE ALWAYS DREAMED ABOUT MAKING THAT PROUD WALK ACROSS THE GRADUATION STAGE TO GET MY
COLLEGE DEGREE. IN 2005, THAT DREAM<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> CAME TRUE. AT GRAND VALLEY STATE
UNIVERSITY. WITH PREPARE ME TO DO WHAT I LOVE, TEACH BACK HOME AT OUR
CALENDAR.
-- NORTH CAROLINA.
[CHEERS] THEN CAME THE BILLS.
$40,000 IN STUDENT DEBT AND ALL THE ANXIETY AND STRUGGLE THAT COMES WITH IT. TEACHING OFFER SO MANY REWARDS,
A BIG SALARY IS NOT ONE OF THEM. A $300 CHECK I READ EVERY MONTH
REPRESENTS SAVINGS I CAN PUT AWAY, CAR REPAIRS I CAN'T MAKE, MEDICAL COSTS I HAVE TO PUT OFF
IN WITH MY WIFE, AMANDA, AND
SCHOOL AFTER TAKING TIME OFF TO
HELP CARE FOR HER SICK MOTHER,
ANOTHER $30,000 BILL IS ON THE
WAY. LIFE FEELS LIKE WE ARE RUNNING
ON A TREADMILL. NO MATTER HOW HARD WE TRY, WE CAN'T GET AHEAD. AND I'M NOT ALONE. STUDENT DEBT HAS MORE THAN
DOUBLED IN THE LAST DECADE AND NOW EXCEEDS $1.2 TRILLION.
NONE OF US ARE LOOKING FOR GUARANTEE SUCCESS. JUST A FAIR CHANCE AT IT.
THAT IS WHY I'M SO PROUD TO
SUPPORT HILLARY CLINTON FOR
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.
[CHEERS] SHE'S GOT TO MAKE COLLEGE
DEBT-FREE FOR ALL AND WILL HELP
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE LIKE ME WITH EXISTING DEBT SAVE THOUSANDS OF
DOLLARS.
I DON'T KNOW HER, BUT IT FEELS
LIKE SHE KNOWS ME. HILLARY CLINTON HAS ARE BACK,
LET'S MAKE SURE WE HAVE HERS
THIS NOVEMBER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
