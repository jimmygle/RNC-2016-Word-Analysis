<strong>Unidentified Speaker</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> THANK YOU. LAST MONTH, OUR NATION WAS
ROCKED TO ITS CORE BY A SENSELESS AND HATEFUL ATTACK
THAT CLAIMED THE LIVES OF 49 LGBTQ PEOPLE AND ALLIES AT<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> PULSE NIGHTCLUB IN ORLANDO. THEY WERE BROTHERS AND SISTERS. THEY WERE SONS AND DAUGHTERS. ABOVE ALL, THEY WERE HUMAN BEINGS. YET, WHILE THE NATION MOURNED,
DONALD TRUMP STRUTTED BEFORE THE
CAMERAS AND EXPLOITED OUR
NATIONAL TRAGEDY. HE HAD THE AUDACITY TO TELL THE
AMERICAN PUBLIC THAT HE WAS THE
TRUE CHAMPION FOR LGBTQ PEOPLE
IN THIS RACE, AND THAT OUR COMMUNITY WOULD BE BETTER OFF WITH HIM IN THE WHITE HOUSE.
