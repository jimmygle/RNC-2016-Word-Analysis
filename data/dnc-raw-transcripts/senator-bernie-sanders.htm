<p class='short_transcript'> >> THANK YOU.
[CHEERING] THANK YOU.
[CHEERING] THANK YOU.
[CHEERING] THANK YOU. THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH.
[CHEERING] THANK YOU. THANK YOU.
[CHEERING] THANK<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> YOU VERY MUCH.
[CHEERING] THANK YOU.
[CHEERING] IT IS AN HONOR -- THANK YOU.
[CHEERING] THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
[CHEERING] IT IS AN HONOR TO BE HERE
TONIGHT.
[CHEERING] THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
[CHEERING] IT IS AN HONOR TO BE HERE TONIGHT AND TO BE FOLLOWING IN THE FOOTSTEPS OF MY GOOD FRIEND ELIZABETH WARREN AND TO BE HERE TONIGHT TO THANK MICHELLE OBAMA
FOR HER INCREDIBLE SERVICE TO OUR COUNTRY. SHE HAS MADE ALL OF US PROUD.
LET ME GET BY THANKING THE
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF
AMERICANS WHO ACTIVELY
PARTICIPATED IN OUR CAMPAIGN AS
VOLUNTEERS. THANK YOU.
[CHEERING] LET ME THANK THE 2 1/2 MILLION
AMERICANS WHO HELPED FUND OUR
CAMPAIGN WITH AN UNPRECEDENTED 8
MILLION INDIVIDUAL CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS.
[CHEERING] ANYONE KNOW WHAT THAT AVERAGE
CONTRIBUTION WAS?
>> THAT'S RIGH --
>> $27. LET ME THANK THE 13 MILLION AMERICANS WHO VOTED FOR THE POLITICAL REVOLUTION, GIVING US
.
[CHEERING] GIVING US THE 1846 PLEDGED
DELEGATES HERE TONIGHT.
[CHEERING] AND DELEGATES, THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE AND THANK YOU FOR ALL THE WORK YOU HAVE DONE. I LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR VOTES
DURING THE ROLL CALL ON TUESDAY NIGHT.
[CHEERING] AND LET ME OFFER A SPECIAL
THANKS TO THE PEOPLE OF MY OWN
STATE OF VERMONT.
[CHEERING] WHO HAVE SUSTAINED ME AND
SUPPORTED ME AS A MAYOR,
CONGRESSMAN, SENATOR AND
PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE.
[CHEERING] AND TO MY FAMILY MY WIFE JANE,
, FOUR KIDS AND SEVEN GRANDCHILDREN, THANK YOU VERY
MUCH.
[CHEERING] I UNDERSTAND THAT MANY PEOPLE HERE IN THIS CONVENTION HALL AND AROUND THE COUNTRY ARE DISAPPOINTED ABOUT THE FINAL RESULTS OF THE NOMINATING
PROCESS. I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT NO
ONE IS MORE DISAPPOINTED THAN I
AM.
[CHEERING] BUT TO ALL OF OUR SUPPORTERS
HERE AND AROUND THE COUNTRY, I HOPE YOU TAKE ENORMOUS PRIDE IN THE HISTORICAL ACCOMPLISHMENTS WE HAVE ACHIEVED.
[CHEERING] TOGETHER, MY FRIENDS, WE HAVE
BEGUN A POLITICAL REVOLUTION TO TRANSFORM AMERICA AND THAT
REVOLUTION, OUR REVOLUTION,
CONTINUES.
[CHEERING] ELECTION DAYS, AND GO. BUT THE STRUGGLE OF THE PEOPLE TO CREATE A GOVERNMENT WHICH
REPRESENTS ALL OF US AND NOT
JUST THE 1%.
[CHEERING] A GOVERNMENT BASED ON THE
PRINCIPLES OF ECONOMIC, SOCIAL, RACIAL, AND ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE, THAT STRUGGLE CONTINUES.
[CHEERING] AND I LOOK FORWARD TO BEING PART
OF THAT STRUGGLE WITH YOU.
[CHEERING] LET ME BE AS CLEAR AS I CAN BE.
THIS ELECTION IS NOT ABOUT, AND HAS NEVER BEEN ABOUT, HILLARY
CLINTON, OR DONALD TRUMP, OR
BERNIE SANDERS OR ANY OF THE
OTHER CANDIDATES WHO SOUGHT THE PRESIDENCY. THIS ELECTION IS NOT ABOUT
POLITICAL GOSSIP. IT'S NOT ABOUT POLLS. IT'S NOT ABOUT CAMPAIGN
STRATEGY. IT'S NOT ABOUT FUND-RAISING.
IT'S NOT ABOUT ALL THE THINGS THE MEDIA SPENDS SO MUCH TIME DISCUSSING.
[CHEERING] THIS ELECTION IS ABOUT, AND MUST BE ABOUT, THE NEEDS OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND THE KIND OF
FUTURE WE CREATE FOR OUR
CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN.
[CHEERING] THIS ELECTION IS ABOUT ENDING
THE 40-YEAR DECLINE OF OUR
MIDDLE CLASS.
[CHEERING] THE REALITY THAT 47 MILLION MEN, WOMEN AND CHILDREN LIVE IN
POVERTY. IT IS ABOUT UNDERSTANDING THAT IF WE DO NOT TRANSFORM OUR
ECONOMY, OUR YOUNGER GENERATION
WILL LIKELY HAVE A LOWER
STANDARD OF LIVING THEN THEIR PARENTS.
THIS ELECTION IS ABOUT ENDING
THE GROTESQUE LEVEL OF INCOME
AND WEALTH INEQUALITY THAT WE
HAVE IN AMERICA TODAY.
[CHEERING] IT IS NOT MORAL, NOT ACCEPTABLE AND IT IS NOT SUSTAINABLE THAT THE TOP 1/10 OF 1% NOW OWN ALMOST AS MUCH WEALTH AS THE
BOTTOM 90%.
>> BOO!
>> OR THAT THE TOP 1% IN RECENT
YEARS HAS EARNED 85% OF ALL NEW INCOME. THAT IS UNACCEPTABLE. THAT MUST CHANGE.
>> BOO!
>> THIS ELECTION IS ABOUT REMEMBERING WHERE WE WERE 7 1/2 YEARS AGO WHEN PRESIDENT OBAMA CAME INTO OFFICE AFTER EIGHT
YEARS OF REPUBLICAN TRICKLE-DOWN ECONOMICS.
[CHEERING] THE REPUBLICANS WANT US TO
FORGET THAT AS A RESULT OF THE
GREED, RECKLESSNESS AND ILLEGAL
BEHAVIOR ON WALL STREET, OUR
ECONOMY WAS IN THE WORST
ECONOMIC DOWNTURN SINCE THE
GREAT DEPRESSION. THAT IS WHERE WE WERE. SOME 800,000 PEOPLE A MONTH WERE
LOSING THEIR JOBS. 800,000 PEOPLE. WE WERE RUNNING UP A RECORD-BREAKING DEFICIT OF $1.4 TRILLION AND THE WORLD'S FINANCIAL SYSTEM WAS ON THE
VERGE OF COLLAPSE. THAT IS WHERE WE WERE. WE HAVE COME A LONG WAY IN THE
LAST 7 1/2 YEARS, AND I THANK
PRESIDENT OBAMA AND VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN.
[CHEERING] I THANK THEM FOR THEIR LEADERSHIP IN PULLING US OUT OF THAT TERRIBLE RECESSION.
YES, WE HAVE MADE PROGRESS, BUT I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE THAT MUCH, MUCH MORE NEEDS TO BE DONE.
[CHEERING] THIS ELECTION IS ABOUT WHICH
CANDIDATE UNDERSTANDS THE REAL
PROBLEMS FACING THIS COUNTRY AND
HAS OFFERED REAL SOLUTIONS.
[CHEERING] NOT JUST BOMBAST,
FEAR-MONGERING, NAME-CALLING AND DIVISIVENESS.
WE NEED LEADERSHIP IN THIS
COUNTRY WHICH WILL IMPROVE THE
LIVES OF WORKING FAMILIES, THE
CHILDREN, THE ELDERLY, THE SICK
AND THE POOR.
[CHEERING] WE NEED LEADERSHIP WHICH BRINGS
OUR PEOPLE TOGETHER AND MAKES US STRONGER.
[CHEERING] NOT LEADERSHIP WHICH INSULTS LATINOS, MEXICANS, INSULTS MUSLIMS AND WOMEN, AFRICAN-AMERICANS AND VETERANS AND SEEKS TO DIVIDE US UP.
[CHEERING] BY THESE MEASURES, ANY OBJECTIVE OBSERVER WILL CONCLUDE THAT BASED ON HER IDEAS AND HER LEADERSHIP, HILLARY CLINTON MUST BECOME THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.
[CHEERING] THE CHOICE --
[CHEERING] THIS ELECTION IS ABOUT A SINGLE MOTHER I SAW IN NEVADA WHO, WITH TEARS IN HER EYES, TOLD ME THAT
SHE WAS SCARED TO DEATH ABOUT
THE FUTURE BECAUSE SHE AND HER DAUGHTER WERE NOT MAKING IT ON
THE $10.45 AN HOUR SHE WAS
EARNING. THIS ELECTION IS ABOUT THAT
WOMAN AND THE MILLIONS OF OTHER
WORKERS IN THIS COUNTRY WHO ARE
STRUGGLING TO SURVIVE ON TOTALLY
INADEQUATE WAGES.
[CHEERING] HILLARY CLINTON UNDERSTANDS THAT
IF SOMEONE IN THIS COUNTRY WORKS 40 HOURS A WEEK, THAT PERSON SHOULD NOT BE LIVING IN POVERTY.

[CHEERING] SHE UNDERSTANDS THAT WE MUST RAISE THE MINIMUM WAGE TO A LIVING WAGE.
[CHEERING] AND SHE IS DETERMINED TO CREATE MILLIONS OF NEW JOBS BY
REBUILDING OUR CRUMBLING INFRASTRUCTURE, OUR ROADS,
BRIDGES, WATER SYSTEMS AND
WASTEWATER PLANTS.
[CHEERING] BUT HER OPPONENT, DONALD TRUMP,
WELL, HE HAS A VERY DIFFERENT
VIEW. HE DOES NOT SUPPORT RAISING THE FEDERAL MINIMUM WAGE OF $7.25 AN HOUR, A STARVATION WAGE. WHILE DONALD TRUMP BELIEVES IN YUUUGE  TAX BREAKS FOR
BILLIONAIRES, HE BELIEVES THAT
STATES SHOULD ACTUALLY HAVE THE
RIGHT TO LOWER THE MINIMUM WAGE BELOW $7.25. BROTHERS AND SISTERS, THIS
ELECTION IS ABOUT OVERTURNING CITIZENS UNITED.
[CHEERING] CITIZENS UNITED IS ONE OF THE
WORST SUPREME COURT DECISIONS IN
THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY. THAT

[CHEERING] THAT DECISION ALLOWS THE WEALTHIEST PEOPLE IN AMERICA, LIKE THE BILLIONAIRE KOCH BROTHERS TO SPEND HUNDREDS OF
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS BUYING
ELECTIONS AND, IN THE PROCESS,
UNDERMINE AMERICAN DEMOCRACY.
>> BOO!
>> HILLARY CLINTON WILL NOMINATE
JUSTICES TO THE SUPREME COURT
WHO ARE PREPARED TO OVERTURN
CITIZENS UNITED.
[CHEERING] AND END THE MOVEMENT TOWARD
OLIGARCHY IN THIS COUNTRY. HER

[CHEERING] HER SUPREME COURT APPOINTMENTS
WILL ALSO DEFEND A WOMAN'S RIGHT TO CHOOSE.
[CHEERING] WORKERS' RIGHTS, THE RIGHTS OF
THE LGBTQ ME TO TAKE, THE NEEDS
OF MINORITIES AND IMMIGRANTS AND THE GOVERNMENT'S ABILITY TO
PROTECT OUR ENVIRONMENT.
[CHEERING] IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE THIS ELECTION IS IMPORTANT, IF YOU THINK YOU CAN SIT IT OUT, TAKE A MOMENT TO THINK ABOUT THE SUPREME COURT JUSTICES THAT DONALD TRUMP WOULD NOMINATE. AND WHAT THAT WOULD MEAN TO CIVIL LIBERTIES, EQUAL RIGHTS
AND THE FUTURE OF OUR COUNTRY.
THIS ELECTION IS ABOUT THE
THOUSANDS OF YOUNG PEOPLE I HAVE
MET ALL OVER THE COUNTRY.
[CHEERING] THE THOUSANDS I HAVE MET WHO
HAVE LEFT COLLEGE DEEPLY IN DEBT AND TRAGICALLY THE MANY OTHERS WHO CANNOT AFFORD TO GO
TO COLLEGE. DURING THE PRIMARY CAMPAIGN, SECRETARY CLINTON AND I BOTH
FOCUSED ON THIS ISSUE BUT WITH
SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT APPROACHES.
RECENTLY, HOWEVER, WE HAVE COME TOGETHER ON A PROPOSAL THAT WILL
REVOLUTIONIZE HIGHER EDUCATION
IN AMERICA.
[CHEERING] IT WILL GUARANTEE THAT THE
CHILDREN OF ANY FAMILY IN THIS COUNTRY WITH AN ANNUAL INCOME OF
$125,000 A YEAR OR LESS, 83% OF OUR POPULATION, WILL BE ABLE TO
GO TO A PUBLIC COLLEGE OR UNIVERSITY TUITION FREE.
[CHEERING] THAT PROPOSAL ALSO SUBSTANTIALLY REDUCES STUDENT DEBT.
[CHEERING] THIS ELECTION IS ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE, THE GREAT ENVIRONMENTAL CRISIS FACING OUR PLANET.
[CHEERING] AND THE NEED TO LEAVE THIS WORLD
IN A WAY THAT IS HEALTHY AND
HABITABLE FOR OUR KIDS AND
FUTURE GENERATIONS.
[CHEERING] HILLARY CLINTON IS LISTENING TO
THE SCIENTISTS WHO TELL US THAT UNLESS WE ACT BOLDLY AND
TRANSFORM OUR ENERGY SYSTEM IN
THE VERY NEAR FUTURE, THERE WILL BE MORE DROUGHT, MORE FLOODS,
MORE ACIDIFICATION OF THE
OCEANS, MORE RISING SEA LEVELS.
SHE UNDERSTANDS THAT WHEN WE DO
-- WE CAN CREATE HUNDREDS OF
THOUSANDS OF JOBS TRANSFORMING OUR ENERGY SYSTEM.
[CHEERING] DONALD TRUMP? WELL, LIKE MOST REPUBLICANS, HE CHOOSES TO REJECT SCIENCE. HE

>> BOO!
>> HE BELIEVES THAT CLIMATE
CHANGE IS A "HOAX," NO NEED TO ADDRESS IT. HILLARY CLINTON UNDERSTANDS THAT A PRESIDENT'S JOB IS TO WORRY ABOUT FUTURE GENERATIONS, NOT THE PROFITS OF THE FOSSIL FUEL INDUSTRY.
[CHEERING] THIS CAMPAIGN IS ABOUT MOVING THE UNITED STATES TOWARD UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE.
[CHEERING] AND REDUCING THE NUMBER OF
PEOPLE WHO ARE UNINSURED OR
UNDERINSURED. HILLARY CLINTON WANTS TO SEE
THAT ALL AMERICANS HAVE THE
RIGHT TO CHOOSE A PUBLIC OPTION
IN THEIR HEALTH CARE EXCHANGE.

[CHEERING] SHE BELIEVES THAT ANYONE 55
OR OLDER SHOULD BE ABLE TO OPT IN TO MEDICARE.
[CHEERING] AND SHE WANTS TO SEE MILLIONS
MORE AMERICANS GAIN ACCESS TO
PRIMARY HEALTH CARE, DENTAL
CARE, MENTAL HEALTH COUNSELING
AND LOW-COST PRESCRIPTION DRUGS
THROUGH A MAJOR EXPANSION OF
COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS.
[CHEERING] AND WHAT IS DONALD TRUMP'S
POSITION ON HEALTH CARE? NO SURPRISE THERE. SAME OLD, SAME OLD REPUBLICAN
CONTEMPT FOR WORKING FAMILIES. HE WANTS TO ABOLISH THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT, THROW 20
MILLION PEOPLE OFF OF THE HEALTH INSURANCE AND CUT MEDICAID FOR
LOWER-INCOME AMERICANS.
>> BOO!
>> HILLARY CLINTON ALSO UNDERSTANDS THAT MILLIONS OF SENIORS, DISABLED VETS AND
OTHERS ARE STRUGGLING WITH THE OUTRAGEOUSLY HIGH COST OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS. AND THE FACT THAT AMERICANS PAY THE HIGHEST PRICES IN THE WORLD FOR THEIR MEDICINE THAT WE USE. SHE KNOWS THAT MEDICARE MUST
NEGOTIATE DRUG PRICES WITH THE
PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY.
[CHEERING] AND THAT DRUG COMPANIES SHOULD
NOT BE MAKING BILLIONS IN
PROFITS WHILE ONE IN FIVE
AMERICANS ARE UNABLE TO AFFORD
THE MEDICINE THEY NEED. THE GREED OF THE DRUG COMPANIES
MUST END.
[CHEERING] THIS ELECTION IS ABOUT THE
LEADERSHIP WE NEED TO PASS
COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM
AND REPAIR A BROKEN CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM.
[CHEERING] IT'S ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT
YOUNG PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY ARE
IN GOOD SCHOOLS AND AT GOOD JOBS, NOT ROTTING IN JAIL CELLS.
[CHEERING] HILLARY CLINTON UNDERSTANDS THAT
WE HAVE TO INVEST IN EDUCATION AND JOBS FOR OUR YOUNG PEOPLE,
NOT MORE JAILS OR INCARCERATION.
[CHEERING] IN THESE STRESSFUL TIMES FOR OUR
COUNTRY, THIS ELECTION MUST BE
ABOUT BRINGING OUR PEOPLE TOGETHER, NOT DIVIDING US UP.

[CHEERING] WHILE DONALD TRUMP IS BUSY INSULTING ONE GROUP AFTER ANOTHER, HILLARY CLINTON UNDERSTANDS THAT OUR DIVERSITY IS ONE OF OUR GREATEST STRENGTHS.
[CHEERING] YES, WE BECOME STRONGER WHEN BLACK AND WHITE, LATINO,
ASIAN AMERICAN, NATIVE AMERICAN,
WHEN ALL OF US STAND TOGETHER.
[CHEERING] YES, WE BECOME STRONGER WHEN MEN
AND WOMEN, YOUNG AND OLD, GAY
AND STRAIGHT, NATIVE BORN AND
IMMIGRANT FIGHT TO CREATE THE
KIND OF COUNTRY WE ALL KNOW WE
CAN BECOME.
[CHEERING] IT IS NO SECRET THAT HILLARY
CLINTON AND I DISAGREE ON A
NUMBER OF ISSUES. THAT'S WHAT THIS CAMPAIGN HAS BEEN ABOUT. THAT'S WHAT DEMOCRACY IS ABOUT.

[CHEERING] BUT I AM HAPPY TO TELL YOU THAT
AT THE DEMOCRATIC PLATFORM
COMMITTEE THERE WAS A
SIGNIFICANT COMING TOGETHER
BETWEEN THE TWO CAMPAIGNS AND WE
PRODUCED, BY FAR, THE MOST
PROGRESSIVE PLATFORM IN THE
HISTORY OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY.
[CHEERING] AMONG MANY OTHER STRONG
PROVISIONS, THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY
NOW CALLS FOR BREAKING UP THE
MAJOR FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ON
WALL STREET AND THE PASSAGE OF A
21ST CENTURY GLASS-STEAGALL ACT.

[CHEERING] IT ALSO CALLS FOR STRONG OPPOSITION TO JOB-KILLING FREE TRADE AGREEMENTS LIKE THE TPP.
[CHEERING] WE HAVE GOT TO MAKE SURE THAT TPP DOES NOT GET TO THE FLOOR OF
THE CONGRESS AND THE LAME DUCK SECTION.
-- IN THE LAME DUCK SESSION.
[CHEERING] OUR JOB NOW IS TO SEE THAT STRONG PLATFORM IMPLEMENTED BY A DEMOCRATIC-CONTROLLED SENATE.
[CHEERING] BY A DEMOCRATIC HOUSE AND A
HILLARY CLINTON PRESIDENCY  AND
.
[CHEERING] AND I'M GOING TO DO ALL THAT I CAN TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN.
[CHEERING] I HAVE KNOWN HILLARY CLINTON FOR
25 YEARS. I REMEMBER HER AS A GREAT FIRST LADY WHO BROKE PRECEDENT IN
TERMS OF THE ROLE THAT A FIRST
LADY WAS SUPPOSED TO PLAY AS SHE
HELPED LEAD THE FIGHT FOR
UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE. I SERVED WITH HER IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE AND KNOW HER AS A FIERCE ADVOCATE FOR THE RIGHTS OF CHILDREN. FOR WOMEN AND FOR THE DISABLED.
[CHEERING] HILLARY CLINTON WILL MAKE AN
OUTSTANDING PRESIDENT AND I AM
PROUD TO STAND WITH HER HERE TONIGHT.
THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH.
[CHEERING]
