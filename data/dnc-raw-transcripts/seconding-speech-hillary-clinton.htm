<strong>Barbara A. Mikulski</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> SEN. MIKULSKI: FELLOW DEMOCRATS AND A SPECIAL HELLO TO THE STATE OF MARYLAND! OUR NATION WAS BORN HERE IN PHILADELPHIA 240 YEARS AGO. OUR FOUNDING FATHERS<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> GAVE US A GREAT START, BUT IT WAS THE
FOUNDING MOTHERS THAT SAID "DO
NOT FORGET THE LADIES, FOR WE
WILL FOMENT OUR OWN REVOLUTION."
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]THEY STARTED THE JOB, BUT WE ARE GOING TO KEEP IT GOING. NO YES, WE DO BREAK BARRIERS. I BROKEN BARRIER WHEN I BECAME THE FIRST DEMOCRATIC WOMAN ELECTED IN THE SENATE IN HER OWN RIGHT.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] IN THE FIRST TO SHARE THE POWERFUL APPROPRIATIONS WITH IT. SO IT IS WITH A FULL HEART THAT
I AM HERE TODAY AS WE NOMINATE HILLARY CLINTON TO BE THE FIRST WOMAN PRESIDENT.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] MANY OF YOU HAVE BROKEN
BARRIERS. YOU WERE THE FIRST TO GO TO COLLEGE, THE FIRST TO START A BUSINESS, MAYBE THE FIRST TO BE
A CITIZEN. BUT WHEN YOU BROKE A BARRIER,
YOU DID NOT DO IT FOR YOURSELF,
YOU DID IT FOR OTHERS WHO WOULD
NOT HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY. THAT IS WHAT HILLARY WANTS TO
DO. SHE WANTS TO BREAK THE BARRIER TO OPPORTUNITY SO YOU WON'T HAVE
BARRIER'S. YOU CAN COUNT ON HER. SHE WILL WORK FOR YOU. HILLARY WANTS TO GET RESULTS. SHE WILL FIGHT FOR YOUR
DAY-TO-DAY NEEDS. AND THE LONG-RANGE NEEDS OF THE COUNTRY. SHE WILL FIGHT FOR THE MACRO ISSUES AND THE MACARONI AND
CHEESE ISSUES. SO YOU WILL HAVE NATIONAL
SECURITY AND ECONOMIC SECURITY.
SO YOU WILL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY
FOR GOOD JOBS AND A GOOD
NEIGHBORHOOD WITH A GOOD SCHOOL, AND YOUR KIDS WILL HAVE A REALLY
GOOD FUTURE. SO YOU WILL HAVE EQUAL PAY FOR EQUAL WORK, MINIMUM WAGES--
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] FOR HEALTH CARE WHEN YOU NEED IT. YES, IT'S ABOUT NEW JOBS, AND
THE SOLAR ENERGY. SHE WANTS THAT JOB TO LIGHT UP
YOUR HOME, LIGHT UP YOUR
COMMUNITY, LIGHT UP YOUR LIFE. SHE WANTS THAT LITTLE LIFE IN YOU TO SHINE. THE HILLARY I WORK WITH IS DUTY DRIVEN AND UNFLINCHING.
SHE IS A LEADER. SO ON BEHALF OF ALL THE WOMEN
WHO HAVE BROKEN DOWN BARRIERS FOR OTHERS, AND WITH EYES TOWARD
THE BARRIERS AHEAD, I PROBABLY PRAISE HILLARY CLINTON THE NOMINATE FOR PRESIDENT.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
--I PROUDLY PRAISE HILLARY
CLINTON AT THE NOMINEE FOR
PRESIDENT.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] PLEASE WELCOME REPRESENTATIVE
JOHN LEWIS FROM GEORGIA.

<strong>John Lewis</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> REP. LEWIS: MY BELOVED THE DEMOCRATS, THERE ARE FORCES AND AMERICA THAT WANT TO TAKE US
BACKWARDS. THEY WANT TO UNDO 50 YEARS OF
PROGRESS THIS NATION<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> HAS MADE
UNDER DEMOCRATIC LEADERSHIP. WE HAVE COME TOO FAR, WE HAVE
MADE TOO MUCH PROGRESS, AND WE
ARE NOT GOING BACK, WE ARE GOING FORWARD!
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THAT IS WHY WE ALL MUST GO TO
THE POLLS IN  NOVEMBER AND VOTE
LIKE WE NEVER, EVER VOTED
BEFORE.
[APPLAUSE] EIGHT YEARS AGO OUR PARTY, THE
DEMOCRATIC PARTY NOMINATED AND
ELECTED THE FIRST PERSON OF COLOR TO EVER SERVE IN THE WHITE
HOUSE.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] NOT JUST FOR ONE TERM, BUT TWO TERMS. ON THIS NIGHT, WE WILL SHATTER
THAT GLASS CEILING AGAIN.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WE ARE THE PARTY OF TOMORROW, AND WE WILL BUILD A TRUE
DEMOCRACY IN AMERICA. I MUST TELL YOU, I HAVE KNOWN HILLARY CLINTON FOR MANY YEARS. SHE IS ONE OF THE MOST QUALIFIED CANDIDATES TO EVER RUN FOR
PRESIDENT.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] SHE IS A LEADER. SOMETIMES STANDING AGAINST THE WIND TO BREAK DOWN BARRIERS THAT
DIVIDE US. SHE COULD HAVE DONE ANYTHING
WITH HER LIFE, BUT SHE DECIDED LONG AGO SHE DIDN'T WANT TO DO JUST WELL, SHE WANTED TO DO GOOD.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] SO SHE HAS DEDICATED HER LIFE TO PUBLIC SERVICE AND BUILDING US BUILD OUR AMERICA FOR ALL OF HER
PEOPLE WHERE NO ONE WILL BE LEFT
OUT OR LEFT BEHIND. SO TONIGHT ON BEHALF OF OUR MOTHERS TRYING TO MAKE ENDS MEET
, AND OUR FATHERS WHO HAVE NOT SEEN A PAY INCREASE IN YEARS, ON
BEHALF OF THE STUDENTS DROWNING
IN A SEA OF DEBT, ON BEHALF OF
THOSE THAT SUFFER THE INJUSTICE OF DISCRIMINATION BECAUSE OF THE
COLOR OF THEIR SKIN, FOR
PROTESTING FOR IMMIGRANT RIGHTS,
GAY RIGHTS, AND REMOVING
BARRIERS IN AMERICA. ON BEHALF OF THE VICTIMS OF GUN
VIOLENCE, I GIVE YOU A GREAT
LEADER WHO CAN UNITE US AS A
NATION AND AS A PEOPLE. A LEADER THAT CAN BREAK DOWN THE
BARRIERS AND BUILD A BETTER FUTURE FOR EVERY AMERICAN.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] SHE WILL FIGHT FOR US ALL. WITH HER HEART, HER SOUL, AND
HER MIND. MY FELLOW DEMOCRATS, I AM PLEASED TO SECOND THE NOMINATION FOR HILLARY CLINTON AS THE PARTY CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT OF THE
UNITED STATES.
