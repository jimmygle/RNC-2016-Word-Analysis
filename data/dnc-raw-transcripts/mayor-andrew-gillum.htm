<strong>Andrew Gillum</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> MAYOR GILLUM: HELLO MY FELLOW
DEMOCRATS. AND HELLO MY FELLOW FOR RADIANS.
-- FELLOW FLORIDIANS.
IN CASE YOU NEED A REMINDER,
FLORIDA IS IN THE HOUSE.
[CHEERS<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> AND APPLAUSE] AS I PREPARE FOR TONIGHT, I
THOUGHT BACK ON THE PAST THAT
LED ME TO THIS MOMENT. BORN THE FIFTH OF SEVEN KIDS, IN MIAMI-DADE FLORIDA TO MY DADDY, CHARLES, A CONSTRUCTION WORKER,
AND MY MOTHER FRANCES, A SCHOOL
BUS DRIVER. MY PARENTS WORKED THEIR ENTIRE LIVES TO PROVIDE FOR ME AND FOR MY SIBLINGS. GREATER OPPORTUNITY THAT THEY HAD EVER BEEN AFFORDED. TRADING THE POSSIBILITY FOR ME
TO BE THE FIRST OF MY FAMILY TO
GO TO COLLEGE AND GRADUATE FROM
FLORIDA A&M UNIVERSITY.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THEY DARED US TO FLY HIGHER THAN THEY COULD EVER SEE. AND THEY ALWAYS PROVIDED US THE OPPORTUNITY AND A PATH TO PAY IT FORWARD. I CAN STILL HEAR MY GRANDMOTHER'S VOICE TELLING ME, BOY, GO TO SCHOOL, MIND YOUR TEACHERS, GET YOUR LESSONS, AND
ONE DAY BRING THAT EDUCATION
HOME. SHE SAYS, BRING IT HOME FOR YOUR
BABY SISTER AND LITTLE BROTHER
WHO MAY NOT KNOW WHAT EDUCATION
IS. SHE SAYS BRING IT HOME FOR THAT
LITTLE BOY DOWN THE STREET THAT
YOU PLAY WITH. GOD KNOWS WHERE HE WILL END UP. IT WAS A REMINDER THAT IF WE
WERE GOING TO GET ANYWHERE, WE
WOULD GET THERE TOGETHER. MY FRIENDS, THIS IS THE STORY OF
OUR PARTY. IT'S ALSO WHAT DRIVES OUR
NOMINEE. HILLARY CLINTON HAS SHOWN US HER HEART, HER STRENGTH, HER PASSION
FOR THIS COUNTRY'S FUTURE. A FUTURE THAT MEANS MORE TO ME NOW THAN IT EVER DID BEFORE. BECAUSE IN ADDITION TO BEING THE
MAYOR OF TALLAHASSEE FLORIDA, THE CAPITAL CITY OF OUR NATION'S THIRD-LARGEST STATE, I AM ALSO A
FATHER. AND ALONG WITH MY WIFE, WE ARE RAISING TWO-YEAR-OLD TWINS
JOHNSON AND CAROLINE. WHEN I HEADED TO THE VOTING BOOTH, I WANT YOU TO KNOW THEY ARE COMING WITH ME. BECAUSE I WANT THEM TO KNOW THAT I AM NOT JUST PASSING A VOTE FOR
HILLARY CLINTON AND FELLOW DEMOCRATS.
I AM CASTING A VOTE FOR THEM. ENSURING THE KIND OF FUTURE THEY DESERVE REQUIRES LEADERSHIP THAT
WILL UNIFY AND INSPIRE US. THAT CAN BUILD ON THIS COUNTRY'S BEST INSTINCT FOR CONCLUSION AND OPTIMISM. THE WORLD CAN SEEM SCARY ENOUGH
WITHOUT SO-CALLED LEADERS
LEADING WITH FEAR FOR POLITICAL GAIN. THAT'S RIGHT. EVERY DAY IN THIS COUNTRY BLACK PARENTS SEND THEIR SONS OUT OF A
DEEP SENSE OF ANXIETY, HOPING
THEY WILL RETURN HOME TO THEM
SAFELY. EVERY DAY POLICE OFFICERS KISS THEIR LOVED ONES HEADING TO WORK
AND HAVE THAT FEAR IN THEIR
HEARTS. IN THESE TIMES OF ANGER AND FEAR, WE CANNOT AFFORD TO
RETREAT TO OUR RESPECTIVE CORNERS. WE CAN'T LET THIS ANIMOSITY GROW AND GET STRONGER. THAT'S RIGHT. AND THE TRUTH IS, WE HAVE SEEN
EXAMPLES OF COMMUNITIES AND LAW
ENFORCEMENT COMING TOGETHER IN
CRISIS, TO GRIEVE TOGETHER AND
HELP EACH OTHER HEAL. THAT IS EXACTLY HOW IT IS
SUPPOSED TO WORK. AND IT'S ON ALL OF US TO ENSURE
THAT IN OUR COMMUNITIES, THAT
BECOMES THE REALITY. BECAUSE IN THE END, WE ALL WANT
THE SAME THING FOR OUR FAMILIES. OUR FATES ARE INDEX WOULD
COMPLETE TIGHT TOGETHER.
-- OUR FATES ARE INEXPLICABLY
TIED TOGETHER. WE CAN RENEW TRUST IN EACH OTHER
ONCE AGAIN. I BELIEVE WITH EVERY FIBER OF MY
BEGIN THAT HILLARY CLINTON IS
THE LEADER THAT WE NEED.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] SO ON INAUGURATION DAY I LOOK FORWARD TO HOLDING MY BABY'S
TIGHTLY. I LOOK FORWARD TO WATCHING
HISTORY UNFOLD BEFORE THEIR EYES
AND BEFORE MINE. AND ALONG WITH YOU SHOUTING
TOWARD THAT EXCHANGE IN
WASHINGTON DC AND SAYING, CONGRATULATIONS, MADAM
PRESIDENT.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THANK YOU AND GOD BLESS.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
