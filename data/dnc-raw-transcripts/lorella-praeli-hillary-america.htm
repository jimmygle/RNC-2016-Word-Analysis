<p class='short_transcript'> >> I WANT TO THANK SOMEBODY
REALLY SPECIAL, WHICH I'M SURE
IS GOING TO EMBARRASS HER.
SHE WAS BORN IN PERU, CAME TO
THE UNITED STATES AS A LITTLE GIRL<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> FOR MEDICAL TREATMENT. SHE EXCELLED ALL THE WAY THROUGH SCHOOL.
WHEN IT CAME TIME FOR COLLEGE, SHE FOUND OUT SHE WAS
UNDOCUMENTED, BUT SHE DECIDED
SHE DID NOT WANT TO LIVE IN BEER
OR SECRECY. SHE WAS CONVINCED THAT THIS WAS HER COUNTRY, SO SHE CAME FORWARD PUBLICLY AS UNDOCUMENTED. LISTEN TO THIS BECAUSE THIS IS REALLY AMAZING.
TOMORROW, PRESIDENT OBAMA WILL
SWEAR HER AND AS ACE IT IS AN --
SWEAR HER IN AS A CITIZEN OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.

<strong>PRAELI</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> PRAELI: GOOD EVENING. MY NAME IS LORELLA PRAELI, AND I
AM AN AMERICAN. I RECENTLY BECAME AN AMERICAN
CITIZEN, BUT FOR 14 YEARS, I WAS
UNDOCUMENTED. AT<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> THE AGED TWO, I WAS HIT BY A
CAR AND LOST MY LEG.
WHEN I THINK ABOUT OUR AMERICAN STORY, I BELIEVE IT WAS BORN IN
THE HEARTS OF MY PARENTS THAT NIGHT AS THEY STOOD OVER MY
HOSPITAL BED BECAUSE MY PARENTS
WERE DETERMINED THAT I WOULD
REACH MY FULL POTENTIAL AND NOT
BE LIMITED BY MY DISABILITY. EVENTUALLY, THE ONLY PLACE THAT COULD CONTAIN SUCH A VISION WAS
HERE IN AMERICA. BECAUSE THIS IS A COUNTRY THAT WAS MADE FOR PEOPLE WITH THE
COURAGE TO BELIEVE IN THEIR DREAMS.
BACK IN PERU, MY MOTHER WAS A PSYCHOLOGIST, BUT HERE IN
AMERICA, SHE WORKED CLEANING
HOUSES FOR 17 YEARS. FROM MORNING TO NIGHT, CARRYING THE AMERICAN SPIRIT IN HER
HEART, SHE, JUST LIKE SO MANY MILLIONS OF PARENTS ACROSS THIS COUNTRY, WORKED SO HARD SO THAT
MY SISTER AND I COULD HAVE A
FULL LIFE.
SHE HAS TAUGHT ME TO NEVER GIVE UP, TO BELIEVE IN MY DREAMS, AND
TO FIGHT TO ACHIEVE THEM. IN SHORT, IT WAS MY UNDOCUMENTED MOTHER WHO TAUGHT ME WHAT IT IS
TO BE AN AMERICAN.
