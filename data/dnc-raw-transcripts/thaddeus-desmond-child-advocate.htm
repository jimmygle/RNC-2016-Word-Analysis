<strong>Thaddeus Desmond</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> IN HER EARLY 20'S, HILLARY CLINTON SPENT TIME AT THE HOSPITAL RESEARCHING CHILD ABUSE
, SHE SAW CHILDREN WHO HAD BEEN
BEATEN, BURNED, NEGLECTED. THE<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> EXPERIENCE TURNED HER INTO A LIFELONG CHAMPION FOR KIDS IN
NEED.
AS A CHILD ADVOCATE SOCIAL
WORKER, I TOO AM A CHAMPION FOR CHILDREN AND I AM LUCKY TO WORK
WITH A TEAM OF CHAMPIONS, SOCIAL WORKERS, CASE MANAGERS,
ATTORNEYS, OTHER INDIVIDUALS AS
LIFELONG WORK IS TO ENSURE ALL
CHILDREN HAVE A CHANCE AT
GREATNESS. CHILD ADVOCACY HAS MADE
SIGNIFICANT STRIDES IN THE RIGHT
DIRECTION BUT OUR WORK IS FAR
FROM FINISHED. EVERY CHILD DESERVES AN ADVOCATE
WHO TRULY CARES FOR THEM AND
THEY HAVE ONE IN HILLARY CLINTON
.
HILLARY KNOWS THAT WHEN YOU
FIGHT FOR OUR KIDS, YOU ARE
FIGHTING FOR OUR FUTURE AND THAT
IS WHY I'M WITH HER.

<p class='short_transcript'> >> MY NAME IS ANTON, PRESIDENT
OF UNITY IN THE COMMUNITY. IN 1972, HILLARY TRAVEL TO ALABAMA ON A MISSION. SHE WAS THERE TO HELP SHED LIGHT ON SEGREGATED<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> ACADEMIES, PRIVATE SCHOOLS THAT POPPED UP ACROSS THE STATE AFTER THE SUPREME COURT ORDERED PUBLIC SCHOOLS TO INTEGRATE. WHEN THESE SCHOOLS APPLY FOR FEDERAL STATE EXEMPTIONS, THEY CLAIMED THEY WEREN'T TRYING TO PROMOTE SEGREGATION BUT HILLARY HELPED PROVE THEY WERE. HILLARY VISITED ONE OF THESE
ACADEMIES POSING AS A MOTHER LOOKING FOR A ROLE FOR HER CHILD AND YET -- AND THE ADMINISTRATORS ASSURED THEY
WEREN'T ACCEPTING BLACK CHILDREN. HILLARY SHARED HER FOUNDLINGS WHAT THE DEFENSE FUND.
I WORK HARD AND THINK ABOUT THE
FAMILIES IN MY COMMUNITY. IN SOCIETY TODAY, WE MUST STAND
UP, PROMOTE NONVIOLENCE, AND
THAT IS WHY I'M WITH HILLARY
CLINTON COME NOVEMBER.</span><span class='hidden-full-transcript-ellipses'>...</span></p><a href='#' class='hidden-full-transcript-link'><i class='icon-chevron-down'></i> <span class='link-show-full-text'>Show Full Text</span><i class='icon-chevron-up'></i> <span class='link-show-less-text'>Show Less Text</span></a>
