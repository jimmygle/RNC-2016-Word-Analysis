<strong>Karen Williams Weaver</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> MAYOR WEAVER: GOOD EVENING. I'M KAREN WEAVER. I AM THE LEADER OF THE GREAT
CITY OF FLINT MICHIGAN. FLINT IS THE CITY OF THE BIRTHPLACE OF GENERAL MOTORS.<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> THIS LED TO THE CREATION OF THE
UNITED AUTO WORKER. FLINT IS ALSO A CITY IN CRISIS. FIVE YEARS AGO OUR REPUBLICAN STATE GOVERNMENT USED A MICHIGAN LAW TO TAKE OVER CONTROL OF THE
CITY. IN 2014, THE STATE SWITCHED OUR WATER STORES -- SOURCE TO THE RIVER TO SAVE MONEY. IT POISONED A WHOLE COMMUNITY. IT MAY HARM OUR CHILDREN FOR
GENERATIONS. THE PROBLEMS IN FLINT ARE NOT
OVER. THE WATER IS STILL NOT SAFE TO DRINK OR COOK WITH FROM THE TAP.
OUR INFRASTRUCTURE IS BROKEN LEAKING AND RUSTING AWAY. I LOOK OLD ECONOMY STRUGGLES TO REBOUND AND THERE ARE MANY MORE
FLAMES ACROSS THE COUNTRY WHERE
ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES ARE HURTING
OUR KIDS AND FAMILY. TODAY THE HELP WE NEED IS LOCKED
IN THE REPUBLICAN-CONTROLLED U.S. CONGRESS. I AM A VOICE FOR FLINT AND WE
NEED YOUR HELP.
[APPLAUSE] DO YOU KNOW WHO HAS ALSO HEARD
THE CALL FROM FLINT? HILLARY CLINTON. SHE CAME TO FLINT WHEN THE WATER
CRISIS HEAD.
SHE JOINED WITH OUR COMMUNITY GROUPS AND HOURS OF THE LEADERS
AND CHURCHES. SHE SAID I WILL DO EVERYTHING I
CAN TO HELP YOU GET YOUR
STRENGTH AND RESILIENCE FLOWING
THROUGH FLINT AGAIN. THE FLINT WATERWORKS PROGRAM IS
NOW PUTTING THE YOUNG ADULTS PROGRAM INTO NEW JOBS AND
REBUILDING THEIR OWN
COMMUNITIES. HILLARY'S WONDERFUL DAUGHTER CHELSEA CAME TO FLINT TO HELP
START THIS WORK AND CREATE NEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR OUR FAMILY. SOME MONTHS LATER, SHE CAME BACK
TO FLINT AGAIN TO SAY THAT THE BROKEN INFRASTRUCTURE IS A NATIONAL CRISIS. IT IS NOT JUST A FLINT CRISIS. SHE MADE A COMMITMENT THAT SHE
WOULD WORK FOR A LEADFREE AMERICA. THAT IS WHY I AM WITH HER. JOIN WITH FLINT TO GET BEHIND HILLARY CLINTON TO RAISE OUR
VOICES FOR HILLARY CLINTON AND
TO MAKE HER THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. GOD BLESS FLINT AND GOD BLESS
AMERICA.
