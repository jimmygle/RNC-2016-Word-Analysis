<strong>GOVERNOR DAYTON</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> GOVERNOR DAYTON: THANK YOU. I AM HERE TODAY IN PART BECAUSE MY HOME STATE OF MINNESOTA HAS
BEEN HIT BY TRAGEDY, AND WE ARE
NOT ALONE. BATON ROUGE, LOUISIANA.<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> DALLAS, TEXAS.
AND FALCON HEIGHTS, MINNESOTA,
TELL US WHY WE NEED A WISE, STRONG, COMPASSIONATE LEADER FOR
ALL AMERICANS.
WHEN I WAS ELECTED TO THE SENATE 16 YEARS AGO, I WAS SEATED NEXT
TO THE NEW SENATOR FROM NEW
YORK, HILLARY CLINTON. FOR THE NEXT SIX YEARS, I SAW UP CLOSE AND IN PERSON PRECISELY THE KIND OF LEADER THIS COUNTRY NEEDS RIGHT NOW. IN THE SENATE, HILLARY WAS A
PRESENT PARTNER ON BOTH SIDES OF
THE AISLE.
SHE LISTENED TO PEOPLE EXPLAIN
THEIR PROBLEMS, NOT JUST FROM
NEW YORK, BUT THROUGHOUT THE
ENTIRE COUNTRY. SHE CHAMPIONED THEIR CAUSES
BECAUSE SHE HELD THE BELIEVE
THAT WE ALL DO BETTER WHEN WE
ALL DO BETTER. HILLARY CLINTON HAS DEDICATED
HER LIFE TO SERVING THE NEEDS OF
OTHERS.
DONALD TRUMP ON THE OTHER HAND
HAS DEDICATED HIS LIFE TO
SERVING HIMSELF. HE HAS DRIVEN HIS SMALL
BUSINESSES INTO THE GROUND WHY
-- BY REFUSING TO PAY HIS BILLS. AT EVERY TURN OF HIS LIFE, HE
HAS STEPPED ON OTHERS TO GET A LITTLE HIGHER HIMSELF. AND NOW, HE WANTS TO STEP ON ALL OF US. AS DEMOCRATS, WE ARE GOING TO SEND HIM A MESSAGE. HILLARY CLINTON HAS BEEN TRAVELING ALL OVER THE COUNTRY LISTENING, LEARNING, AND OFFERING REAL SOLUTIONS TO THE
PROBLEMS AMERICANS FACE. HER 100 DAYS JOBS PLAN INCLUDES THE LARGEST INVESTMENT IN THE
WORKFORCE SINCE WORLD WAR II. SHE WANTS TO MAKE COLLEGE
AFFORDABLE TO EVERYONE ALONG
WITH OFFERING PAID FAMILY AND MEDICAL LEAVE AND GIVING EVERY
CHILD A CHANCE TO GO TO
PRESCHOOL. HILLARY CLINTON WILL CONTINUE HER LIFELONG FIGHT FOR UNIVERSAL
HEALTH CARE, INCLUDING BRINGING A PUBLIC OPTION, TO THE WHITE HOUSE.
FOR MANY, OUT-OF-POCKET COST'S
ARE STILL TOO HIGH.
PRESCRIPTION DRUGS ARE STILL TOO EXPENSIVE. IT IS TIME WE DECIDED ONCE AND FOR ALL THAT THE PURPOSE OF
HEALTH INSURANCE IS TO GIVE AMERICANS A HEALTH CARE THEY NEED AT PRICES THEY CAN AFFORD, NOT TO PAD THE POCKETS OF
CORPORATE AMERICA.
IF THEY WON'T DO IT, WE WILL. AMERICANS NEED A PRESIDENT WHO WILL PULL US TOGETHER AND MOVE
US AHEAD, A PRESIDENT WHO KNOWS WE ARE STRONGER TOGETHER. THIS PRESIDENT IS HILLARY CLINTON. THE CHOICE COULD NOT BE CLEARER. THE CHOICE COULD NOT BE MORE IMPORTANT.
THAT IS WHY I AM SO PROUD TO
STAND WITH ALL OF YOU TO SUPPORT HILLARY CLINTON AS THE NEXT
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.
THANK YOU.</span><span class='hidden-full-transcript-ellipses'>...</span></p><a href='#' class='hidden-full-transcript-link'><i class='icon-chevron-down'></i> <span class='link-show-full-text'>Show Full Text</span><i class='icon-chevron-up'></i> <span class='link-show-less-text'>Show Less Text</span></a>
