<strong>Bill Clinton</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> MR. CLINTON: THANK YOU.
[CHEERS] THANK YOU. THANK YOU.
[CHEERS] THANK YOU. THANK YOU. IN THE SPRING OF 1971, I MET A
GIRL.
[CHEERS] THE FIRST TIME I SAW<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> HER, WE
WERE APPROPRIATELY ENOUGH, IN A
CLASS ON POLITICAL AND CIVIL
RIGHTS. SHE HAD THICK, BLONDE HAIR, BIG
GLASSES.
[APPLAUSE]
[LAUGHTER] MORE NO MAKEUP. SHE EXUDED THIS STRENGTH OF SELF
POSSESSION I FOUND MAGNETIC. AFTER THE CLASS, I THOUGHT HER
OUT INTENDING TO INTRODUCE
MYSELF. I GOT CLOSE ENOUGH TO TOUCH HER
BACK BUT I COULDN'T DO IT. SOMEHOW, I KNEW THIS WOULD NOT
BE JUST ANOTHER TAP ON THE SHOULDER, THAT I MIGHT BE
STARTING SOMETHING I COULDN'T
STOP. I SAW HER SEVERAL MORE TIMES THE
NEXT FEW DAYS BUT STILL DIDN'T
SPEAK TO HER.
THEN ONE NIGHT IN THE LAW LIBRARY TALKING TO A CLASSMATE
WHO WANTED ME TO JOIN THE YALE LAW JOURNAL, HE SAID IT WOULD
GUARANTEE ME A JOB AT A BIG FIRM
OR A CLERKSHIP WITH A FEDERAL
JUDGE. I JUST WANTED TO GO HOME TO ARKANSAS.
[CHEERS] THEN, I SAW THE GIRL AGAIN
STANDING AT THE OPPOSITE END OF THAT LONG ROOM. FINALLY, SHE WAS STARING BACK AT
ME. SO, I WATCH HER.
SHE CLOSED HER BOOK, PUT IT
DOWN, AND STARTED WALKING TOWARD
ME. SHE WALKED THE WHOLE LENGTH OF
THE LIBRARY, CAME UP TO ME AND SAID "LOOK, IF YOU ARE GOING TO
KEEP STARING AT ME --
[LAUGHTER]
" WE AT LEAST OUGHT TO KNOW EACH
OTHER'S NAME. I'M HILLARY, WHO ARE YOU?"
[CHEERS] I WAS SO IMPRESSED AND SURPRISED
, THAT WHETHER YOU BELIEVE IT OR NOT, MOMENTARILY, I WAS SPEECHLESS.
[APPLAUSE] FINALLY, I SORT OF A BLURTED OUT
MY NAME AND WE EXCHANGED A FEW
WORDS AND SHE WENT AWAY. WELL, I DIDN'T JOIN THE LONG REVIEW BUT I DID LEAVE THAT
LIBRARY WITH A WHOLE NEW GOAL IN MIND. A COUPLE DAYS LATER, I SAW HER AGAIN WEARING A LONG, WHITE, FLOUR SKIRT AND I WENT UP TO HER AND SHE SAID SHE WAS GOING TO REGISTER FOR CLASSES FOR THE
NEXT TERM. I SAID I WOULD GO ALSO.
WE SIT IN LINE AND TALK. YOU HAVE TO DO THAT BACK THEN. I THOUGHT I WAS DOING PRETTY
WELL UNTIL WE GOT TO THE FRONT
OF THE LINE AND THE REGISTRAR LOOKED UP AND SAID "BILL, WHAT
ARE YOU DOING HERE, YOU
REGISTERED THIS MORNING." I TURNED RED AND SHE LAUGHED
THAT BIG LAUGH OF HERS AND I
SAID SINCE MY COVER HAS BEEN BLOWN, I ASKED HER TO TAKE A
WALK DOWN TO THE ART MUSEUM. WE HAVE BEEN WALKING, TALKING, LAUGHING TOGETHER EVER SINCE.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND WE HAVE DONE IT IN GOOD TIMES, THROUGH JOY AND
HEARTBREAK. WE CRIED TOGETHER THIS MORNING ON THE NEWS THAT OUR GOOD FRIEND
AND A LOT OF YOUR GOOD FRIENDS PASSED AWAY EARLY THIS MORNING.
WE BUILT UP A LIFETIME OF MEMORIES. AFTER THE FIRST MONTH AND THAT
FIRST WALK, I DROVE HER HOME TO
PARK RIDGE, ILLINOIS.
[CHEERS] TO MEET HER FAMILY AND SEE THE
TOWN WHERE SHE GREW UP, A
PERFECT EXAMPLE OF POST-WORLD
WAR II MIDDLE-CLASS AMERICA. STREET AFTER STREET OF NICE
HOUSES, GREAT SCHOOLS, BIG
PERKS.
-- PARKS. AND ALMOST ALL WHITE.
I REALLY LIKED HER FAMILY, HER
CRUSTY, CONSERVATIVE FATHER, HER RAMBUNCTIOUS BROTHERS, ALL OF STEALING THE VIRTUE OF ROOTING FOR THE THEIRS AND THE CUBS.
-- BEARS AND THE CUBS. THEY EVEN TOLD ME WHAT WEDDING
FOR NEXT YEAR MEANT.
[LAUGHTER] NOW HER MOTHER WAS A DIFFERENT. SHE WAS MORE LIBERAL. SHE HAD A CHILDHOOD THAT MADE
MINE LOOK LIKE A PIECE OF CAKE. SHE WAS EASY TO UNDERESTIMATE
WITH HER SOFT MANNER AND SHE
REMINDED ME ALL OVER AGAIN THAT
YOU SHOULD NEVER JUDGE A BOOK BY
ITS COVER. KILLING HER WAS ONE OF THE
GREATEST GIFTS A HILLARY EVER GAVE ME -- KNOWING HER WAS ONE OF THE GREATEST GIFTS HILLARY EVER GAVE
ME. DON JONES TOOK HER DOWNTOWN TO
CHICAGO TO HEAR MARTIN LUTHER KING SPEAK AND HE REMAINED HER FRIEND FOR THE REST OF HIS LIFE. THIS WILL BE THE ONLY CAMPAIGN OF HERS HE EVER MISSED. IT COMPELLED HER TO CHANGE PARTIES AND BECOME A DEMOCRAT.
[APPLAUSE] AND BETWEEN COLLEGE AND LAW
SCHOOL, SHE WENT TO ALASKA. MORE TO THE POINT, BY THE TIME I MET HER SHE HAD ALREADY BEEN IN
THE LAW SCHOOL'S LEGAL SERVICES
PROJECT AND HAVE BEEN INFLUENCED
BY MARY RIGHT ANGLE MEN -- ANGLE
MEN INTERVIEWING WORKERS IN MIGRANT CAMPS. SHE HAD ALSO BEGUN WORKING IN THE YELL NEW HAVEN HOSPITAL TO DEVELOP PROCEDURES FOR SUSPECTED
CHILD ABUSE CASES.
SHE GOT SO INVOLVED IN CHILDREN'S ISSUES THAT SHE ACTUALLY TOOK THE NEXT YEAR IN LAW SCHOOL WORKING AT THE CHILD
STUDIES OF CENTER TO LEARN WHAT
MORE COULD BE DONE TO IMPROVE
THE LIVES AND FUTURES OF POOR CHILDREN.
[APPLAUSE] SHE WAS ARE DETERMINED TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO MAKE THINGS BETTER. HILLARY OPENED MY EYES TO A
WHOLE NEW WORLD OF PUBLIC SERVICE BY PRIVATE CITIZENS.
IN THE SUMMER OF 1972, SHE WENT
TO ALABAMA TO VISIT ONE OF THOSE SEGREGATED ACADEMIES. I DON'T -- 
THEY CLAIM FEDERAL TAX EXEMPTIONS TO WHICH THEY WERE NOT LEGALLY ENTITLED.
SHE WAS SENT TO PROVE THEY
WEREN'T. SHE SOLDERED INTO ONE OF THESE ACADEMIES BY HEARST WILL
PRETENDING TO BE A HOUSEWIFE
THAT JUST MOVED TO TOWN.
THEY EXCHANGE PLEASANTRIES AND FINALLY, SHE SAID LET'S GET TO
THE BOTTOM LINE.
IF I ENROLL MY SON IN THIS
SCHOOL, WILL HE BE IN A
SEGREGATED SCHOOL? THE GUY SAID "ABSOLUTELY." SHE HAD HIM. SHE WENT BACK AND HER ENCOUNTER WAS PART OF A REPORT THAT GAVE MARY ENRIGHT THE FORCE THEY NEEDED TO TAKE THOSE TAX EXEMPTIONS AWAY AND GIVE OUR KIDS THE CHANCE AT AN EQUAL EDUCATION.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THEN SHE WENT DOWN SOUTH TEXAS,
WHERE SHE MET --
[CHEERS] SHE MET ONE OF THE NICEST
FELLOWS I EVER MET, FRANKLIN GARCIA, AND HE HELPED HER REGISTER MEXICAN-AMERICAN VOTERS. I THINK SOME OF THEM ARE STILL
AROUND TO VOTE FOR HER IN 2016.
[APPLAUSE] AND IN OUR LAST YEAR IN LAW SCHOOL, HILLARY KEPT UP THIS WORK.
SHE WENT TO SOUTH CAROLINA TO
SEE WHY SO MANY YOUNG AFRICAN-AMERICAN BOYS -- I MEAN
YOUNG TEENAGERS -- WERE BEING
JAILED FOR YEARS WITH ADULTS IN
MEN'S PRISONS. SHE FILED A REPORT ON THAT, WHICH LED TO SOME CHANGES TOO. ALWAYS MAKING THINGS BETTER.
[APPLAUSE] MEANWHILE, LET'S GET BACK TO
BUSINESS.
I WAS TRYING TO CONVINCE HER TO
MARRY ME.
[LAUGHTER] I FIRST PROPOSED TO HER ON A TRIP TO GREAT BRITAIN, THE FIRST
TIME SHE'D EVER BEEN OVERSEAS.
WE WERE ON THE SHORELINE OF THIS WONDERFUL LAKE.
I ASKED HER TO MARRY ME AND SHE
SAID "I CAN'T DO IT."
[LAUGHTER] IN 1974, I WENT HOME TO TEACH IN
LAW SCHOOL AND HILLARY MOVED TO
MASSACHUSETTS TO KEEP WORKING ON
CHILDREN'S ISSUES. THIS TIME, TRYING TO FIGURE OUT
WHY SO MANY KIDS COUNTED IN THE
CENSUS WEREN'T ENROLLED IN SCHOOL. SHE FOUND ONE OF THEM SITTING ALONE ON HER PORCH IN A WHEELCHAIR. ONCE MORE, SHE FILED A REPORT ABOUT THESE KIDS AND THAT HELPED INFLUENCE ULTIMATELY THE CONGRESS TO ADOPT THE PROPOSITION THAT CHILDREN WITH DISABILITIES, PHYSICAL OR
OTHERWISE, SHOULD HAVE EQUAL
ACCESS TO PUBLIC EDUCATION.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] YOU SAW THE RESULT OF THAT LAST NIGHT WHEN ANASTASIA TALKED.
[APPLAUSE] SHE NEVER MADE FUN OF PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES.
SHE TRIED TO EMPOWER THEM BASED
ON THEIR ABILITY.
[APPLAUSE] MEANWHILE, I WAS STILL TRYING TO
GET HER TO MARRY ME.
[LAUGHTER] THE SECOND TIME I ASK, I TRIED
DIFFERENTLY. I SAID "I REALLY WANT YOU TO
MARRY ME BUT YOU SHOULDN'T DO
IT." SHE SMILED AND LOOKED AT ME LIKE
WHAT IS HE UP TO. SHE SAID THAT IS NOT A GOOD
SALES PITCH. I SAID I KNOW BUT IT'S TRUE. AND I MEANT IT. I SAID "I KNOW MOST OF THE YOUNG
DEMOCRATS ARE AGE -- OUR AGE WHO
WANT TO GO INTO POLITICS, THEY MEAN WELL AND THEY SPEAK WELL BUT NONE OF THEM IS AS GOOD AS
YOU ARE AND ACTUALLY DOING THINGS TO MAKE POSITIVE CHANGES IN PEOPLE'S LIVES."
[APPLAUSE] SO I SUGGESTED SHE GO HOME TO ILLINOIS OR MOVED TO NEW YORK
AND LOOK FOR A CHANCE TO RUN FOR
OFFICE. SHE LAUGHED AND SAID "ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND, NO ONE WOULD VOTE FOR ME." I FINALLY GOT HER TO COME VISIT
ME IN ARKANSAS. WHEN SHE DID, THE PEOPLE AT THE
LAW SCHOOL WERE SO IMPRESSED, THEY OFFERED HER A TEACHING
POSITION. SHE DECIDED TO TAKE A HUGE CHANCE. SHE MOVED TO A STRANGE PLACE, MORE RURAL, COSTLY CONSERVATIVE
THAN ANYWHERE SHE HAD BEEN. SHE KNEW GOOD AND WELL PEOPLE
WERE WONDERING WHAT IN THE WORLD
SHE WAS LIKE AND WHETHER THEY
COULD OR SHOULD ACCEPT HER. DIDN'T TAKE THEM LONG TO FIND
OUT WHAT SHE WAS LIKE. SHE LOVED HER TEACHING. SHE GOT FRUSTRATED WHEN ONE OF
HER STUDENTS SAID "WHAT DO YOU
EXPECT, I'M JUST FROM ARKANSAS." SHE SAID "YOU JUST HAVE TO
BELIEVE IN YOUR SELF AND WORK
FOR IT AND SET HIGH GOALS." SHE BELIEVED ANYONE COULD MAKE
IT.
[APPLAUSE] SHE ALSO STARTED THE FIRST LEGAL
AID CLINIC IN NORTHWEST ARKANSAS.
[APPLAUSE] PROVIDING LEGAL AID SERVICES TO
POOR PEOPLE WHO COULDN'T PAY FOR
THEM. ONE DAY, I WAS DRIVING HER TO THE AIRPORT TO FLY BACK TO CHICAGO WHEN WE PASS THIS LITTLE BRICK HOUSE THAT HAD A FOR-SALE
SIGN ON IT AND SHE SAID "THAT'S
A PRETTY HOUSE."
IT HAD 1100 SQUARE FEET, AND
ATTIC FAN AND NO AIR CONDITIONER
, AND A SCREENED IN PORCH. HILLARY COMMENTED ON WHAT A
UNIQUELY DESIGNED AND BEAUTIFUL
HOUSE IT WAS.
SO I TOOK A BIG CHANCE.
I BOUGHT THE HOUSE.
[LAUGHTER] MY MORTGAGE WAS $175 A MONTH. WHEN SHE CAME BACK, I PICKED HER
UP AND SAID YOU REMEMBER THAT
HOUSE YOU LIKE? I SAID WHILE YOU WERE GONE, I THOUGHT IT AND YOU HAVE TO MARRY ME NOW.
[LAUGHTER] THE THIRD TIME WAS THE CHARM.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WE WERE MARRIED IN THAT LITTLE HOUSE ON OCTOBER 11, 1975. I MARRIED MY BEST FRIEND. I WAS STILL IN AWE AFTER MORE
THAN FOUR YEARS OF BEING AROUND HER AT HOW SMART AND STRONG AND LOVING AND CARING SHE WAS AND I REALLY HOPE THAT HER CHOOSING ME
AND REJECTING MY ADVICE TO
PURSUE HER OWN CAREER WAS A DECISION SHE WOULD NEVER REGRET.
A LITTLE OVER A YEAR LATER, WE
MOVED TO LITTLE ROCK WHEN I
BECAME ATTORNEY GENERAL AND SHE
JOINED THE OLDEST LAW FIRM WEST OF THE MISSISSIPPI. SHE STARTED THE ARKANSAS ADVOCATE FOR FAMILY AND
CHILDREN. IT'S A GROUP THAT IS STILL
ACTIVE TODAY. IN 1979.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] IN 1979, JUST AFTER I BECAME GOVERNOR, I JOINED A HEALTH
COMMITTEE TO HELP EXPAND HEALTH
CARE TO ISOLATED MOUNTAIN AREAS. THEY RECOMMENDED TO DO THAT
PARTLY BY DEPLOYING TRAINED NURSE PRACTITIONERS IN PLACES
WITH NO DOCTORS TO PROVIDE PRIMARY CARE. IT WAS A BIG DEAL THEN, HIGHLY CONTROVERSIAL AND VERY
IMPORTANT. AND I GOT THE FEELING THAT WHAT SHE DID FOR THE REST OF HER
LIFE, SHE WAS DOING THERE, SHE
WENT OUT AND FIGURED OUT WHAT WOULD HELP PEOPLE AND IF IT WAS
CONTROVERSIAL, SHE JUST TRIED TO
PERSUADE PEOPLE IT WAS THE RIGHT
THING TO DO.
[APPLAUSE] IT WASN'T THE ONLY BIG THING
THAT HAPPENED LAST SPRING. WE FOUND OUT WE WERE GOING TO BE PARENTS.
[APPLAUSE] AND TIME PASSED. ON FEBRUARY 20 7, 1980, 15 MINUTES AFTER I GOT HOME FROM
THE NATIONAL GOVERNORS
CONFERENCE IN WASHINGTON,
HILLARY'S WATER BROKE AND OFF WE
WENT TO THE HOSPITAL. CHELSEA WAS BORN JUST BEFORE MIDNIGHT.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] IT WAS THE GREATEST MOMENT OF MY
LIFE. THE MIRACLE OF A NEW BEGINNING. MY OWN FATHER DIED THE FOR I WAS BORN.
-- BEFORE I WAS BORN. AND THE ABSOLUTE CONVICTION THAT
MY. OR HAD THE BEST MOTHER --
THAT MY. DAUGHTER HAD THE
BEST MOTHER IN THE WHOLE WORLD. THROUGH NURSING SCHOOL, KINDERGARTEN, T-BALL, SOCCER, VOLLEYBALL, BALLET, AND
CHELSEA'S OWN AMBITIOUS EXCURSIONS, FROM HALLOWEEN PARTIES IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD,
HILLARY FIRST AND FOREMOST WAS A
MOTHER. SHE CAME AS A OFTEN SAID OUR FAMILIES DESIGNATED WORRIER. BORN WITH AN EXTRA RESPONSIBILITY GENE. WE RARELY DISAGREED ON PARENTING
ALTHOUGH SHE DID BELIEVE THAT I
HAD GONE A LITTLE OVER THE TOP
WHEN I TOOK A COUPLE DAYS OFF
WITH CHELSEA TO WATCH ALL SIX
POLICE ACADEMY MOVIES BACK TO BACK. I WAS DEFEATED IN A REAGAN
LANDSLIDE AND I BECAME OVERNIGHT
THE YOUNGEST GOVERNOR IN THE
HISTORY OF THE COUNTRY. HILLARY WAS GREAT. IMMEDIATELY SHE SAID HERE IS
WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO.
WE WERE GOOD A JOB -- E-HOUSE, YOU WILL GET A JOB, AND IF YOU WANT TO RUN AGAIN YOU HAVE TO GO
TALK TO PEOPLE AND FIGURE OUT WHY YOU LOST AND SHOW THEM YOU
STILL HAVE GOOD IDEAS. WITHIN TWO DAYS WE HAD A HOUSE. I SOON HAD A JOB. WE HAD TWO FABULOUS YEARS WITH CHELSEA AND IN 1980 TWO I BECAME
THE FIRST GOVERNOR IN THE
HISTORY OF OUR STATE TO BECOME
ELECTED AGAIN. I THINK MY EXPERIENCE IS, IT IS
A PRETTY GOOD THING TO FOLLOW
HER ADVICE. THE REST OF THE DECADE FLEW BY IT AS OUR LIVES SETTLED INTO A
RHYTHM OF FAMILY AND WORK AND
FRIENDS. IN 1983, HILLARY CHAIRED A
COMMITTEE TO RECOMMEND NEW
EDUCATION STANDARDS FOR US IN
RESPONSE TO A COURT ORDER TO EQUALIZE SCHOOL FUNDING.
A REPORT BY NATIONAL EXPERTS
SAID WE HAD WILLFULLY UNDERFUNDED SCHOOLS, THE WORST
IN AMERICA. TYPICAL HILLARY, SHE HELD
LISTENING TOWARDS IN ALL 75
COUNTIES WITH OUR COMMITTEE. SHE CAME UP WITH REALLY AMBITIOUS RECOMMENDATIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, THAT WE BE THE FIRST STATE IN AMERICA TO
REQUIRE ELEMENTARY COUNSELORS IN
EVERY SCHOOL BECAUSE I'M A KIDS WERE HAVING TROUBLE AT HOME INTO
THEY NEEDED IT. SO, I CALLED THE LEGISLATURE HOPING TO PASS THE STANDARDS,
PASS THE PAY RATE FOR TEACHERS,
RAISE THE SALES TAX TO PAY FOR
IT ALL. I KNEW IT WOULD BE HARD TO PASS
BUT IT GOT EASIER AFTER HILLARY HEADED THE EDUCATION COMMITTEE AND THE CHAIRMAN SAID, IT LOOKS TO ME LIKE WE ELECTED THE WRONG CLINTON.
[APPLAUSE] MR. CLINTON: THE SAME EXPERT YOU
SAID WE HAD THE WORST SCHOOLS IN AMERICA SAID -- AND THAT IS
BECAUSE OF THOSE STANDARDS THAT HILLARY RECOMMENDED. TWO YEARS LATER, HILLARY TOLD ME
ABOUT A PRESCHOOL PROGRAM DEVELOPED IN ISRAEL. HOME INSTRUCTION FOR PRESCHOOL
YOUNGSTERS. THE IDEA WAS TO TEACH PARENTS TO
BE THERE CHILDREN'S FIRST
TEACHERS.
SHE SAID SHE THOUGHT IT WOULD WORK IN ARKANSAS.
I SAID, THAT IS GREAT WHAT ARE
WE GOING TO DO.
SHE SAID, I ONLY CALLED THE
WOMAN IT IS REAL AND SHE WILL BE
ON TODAY'S TO HELP AS GET
STARTED. NO, I AM BEING DRAGGED AROUND TO
ALL THESE LITTLE PRESCHOOL
REGULATIONS. I AM BEING DRAGGED TO PRESCHOOL
GRADUATION WATCHING THESE POOR
PARENTS WITH TEARS IN THEIR EYES
BECAUSE THEY NEVER THOUGHT THEY
WOULD BE ABLE TO HELP THEIR KIDS LEARN.
[APPLAUSE] MR. CLINTON: 20 YEARS OF RESEARCH HAS SHOWN HOW WELL THIS PROGRAM WORKS TO IMPROVE READINESS FOR SCHOOLS AND ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT.
THERE ARE A LOT OF YOUNG ADULTS
WHO HAVE NO IDEA HILLARY HAD
ANYTHING TO DO WITH IT BUT THEY
ARE ENJOYING BETTER LIVES
BECAUSE OF THAT PROGRAM. SHE DID ALL OF THIS WHILE BEING
A FULL-TIME WORKER, A MOTHER,
AND ENJOYING OUR LIFE.
WHY? WELL, SHE IS INSATIABLE CURIOUS, A NATURAL LEADER, GOOD
ORGANIZER, AND THE BEST DARN
CHANGE MAKER I HAVE EVER MET IN
MY ENTIRE LIFE.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] 
MR. CLINTON: SO LOOK, THIS IS A
REALLY IMPORTANT POINT FOR YOU
TO TAKE OUT OF THIS CONVENTION.
IF YOU BELIEVE IT MAKING CHANGE
FROM THE BOTTOM-UP, IF YOU
BELIEVE THE MEASURE CHANGES ARE MANY EVILS LIVES ARE AFFECTED,
YOU KNOW IT IS HARD AND SOME PEOPLE THINK IT IS BORING. SPEECHES LIKE THIS ARE FUN.
ACTUALLY DOING THE WORK IS HARD.
SO PEOPLE SAY, WELL WE NEED TO
CHANGE. SHE HAS BEEN AROUND A LONG TIME. SHE SURE HAS. AND SHE HAS SURE BEEN WORTH EVERY SINGLE YEAR SHE HAS PUT INTO MAKING PEOPLE'S LIVES
BETTER.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] MR. CLINTON: I CAN TELL YOU THIS
-- IF YOU WERE SITTING WHERE I
AM SITTING AND YOU HEARD WHAT I
HAVE HEARD AND AT EVERY DINNER
CONVERSATION, LUNCH CONVERSATION, ON EVERY LONG WALK, YOU WOULD SAY, THIS WOMAN
HAS NEVER BEEN SATISFIED WITH
THE STATUS QUO IN ANYTHING.
SHE ALWAYS WANTS TO MOVE THE
BALL FORWARD. THAT IS JUST TOO SHE IS.
-- WHO SHE IS. WHEN I BECAME PRESIDENT WITH A
COMMITMENT TO REFORM HEALTH
CARE, HILLARY WAS A NATURAL
HEALTH CARE TASK FORCE.
YOU WILL KNOW ABOUT THE FILIBUSTER. HILLARY IMMEDIATELY WENT TO WORK ON SOLVING THE PROBLEMS THE BILL SOUGHT TO ADDRESS ONE-BY-ONE. THE MOST IMPORTANT GOAL WAS TO
GET MORE CHILDREN WITH HEALTH
INSURANCE. IN 1997, CONGRESS PASSED THE TREATMENTS HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM, STILL AN IMPORTANT PART
OF OBAMAS AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. IT ENSURES MORE THAN 8 MILLION KIDS. THERE ARE A LOT OF OTHER THINGS AND THAT BILL SHE GOT GOING PEACE-BY-PEAS. PUSHING THE ROCK UP THE HILL. IN 1987, -- 97, SHE ALSO MET
WITH THE HOUSE MINORITY LEADER
WHO MAYBE DISLIKES ME MORE THAN
ANY OF NEWT GINGRICH'S CROWD. THEY WORKED ON A BUILD TOGETHER TO INCREASE ADOPTIONS OF CHILDREN OUT OF FOSTER CARE.
SHE WANTED TO DO IT BECAUSE SHE
KNEW THAT TOM, FOR ALL OF OUR DIFFERENCES, WAS IN ADOPTED
PARENT AND SHE HONORED HIM FOR
DOING THAT.
-- WAS IN ADOPTIVE PARENT AND
SHE HONORED HIM FOR DOING THAT.
THE BILL PASSED I AN OVERWHELMING BIPARTISAN MAJORITY
AND LEAD TO A BIG INCREASE OF
CHILDREN OUT OF FOSTER CARE
INCLUDING NOT INFANT KIDS AND SPECIAL NEEDS KIDS.
IT MADE LIFE BETTER, BECAUSE SHE
IS A CHANGE-MAKER. THAT IS WHAT SHE DOES.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] MR. CLINTON: NOW, WHEN YOU ARE DOING ALL OF THIS, LIFE DOES NOT
STOP. 1997 WAS THE YEAR CHELSEA FINISHED HIGH SCHOOL AND WENT TO
COLLEGE. WE WERE HAPPY FOR HER BUT SAD
FOR US. TO SEE HER GO. I WILL NEVER FORGET MOVING HERE
-- HER INTO HER DORM ROOM AT
STANFORD. IT WAS IN A GREAT LITTLE REALITY
FLICK. THERE I WAS, IN A TRANCE STARING OUT THE WINDOW TRYING NOT TO CRY
AND THERE WAS HILLARY ON HER
HANDS AND NEEDS -- NICE, DESPERATELY LOOKING FOR ONE MORE
DRAWER TO PUT LINER PAPER IN. FINALLY, CHELSEA TOOK CHARGE AND TOLD US EVER SO GENTLY THAT IT
WAS TIME FOR US TO GO. SO, WE CLOSED A BIG CHAPTER IN
THE MOST IMPORTANT WORK IN OUR
LIVES. AS YOU WILL SEE THURSDAY NIGHT
WINCHELSEA SPEAKS, HILLARY HAS
DONE A PRETTY FINE JOB OF BEING A MOTHER.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] 
MR. CLINTON: IN, AS YOU SAW LAST
NIGHT BEYOND A SHADOW OF A
DOUBT, SO HAS MICHELLE OBAMA. NOW -- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] MR. CLINTON: IN 1999,
CONGRESSMAN CHARLIE RHEINGOLD
AND OTHER DEMOCRATS ORDERED HILLARY -- URGED HILLARY TO RUN FOR THE SEAT OF RETIRING SENATOR PAT MORAN HAM.
WE HAD ALWAYS INTENDED TO GO TO NEW YORK AFTER THE COMMUTE TO
ARKANSAS, BUT THAT HAD NEVER OCCURRED TO EITHER ONE OF US.
HILLARY HAD NEVER RUN FOR OFFICE BEFORE BUT SHE CITED TO GIVE IT
A TRY. SHE BEGAN HER CAMPAIGN THE
ALWAYS -- THE WAY SHE ALWAYS
DOES THINGS. I LISTENING AND LEARNING.
AFTER A TOUGH BATTLE, NEW YORK
ELECTED HER TO THE SEAT ONCE HELD BY ANOTHER OUTSIDER, ROBERT
KENNEDY.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] MR. CLINTON: AND -- SHE DID NOT LET HIM DOWN. HER EARLY YEARS WERE DOMINATED
BY 9/11.
BY WORKING TO FIND THE RECOVERY. MONITORING THE HEALTH.
PROVIDING COMPENSATION TO
VICTIMS AND FIRST-RESPONDERS. SHE AND SENATOR SHUMAN WORKED TIRELESS AND SO WERE THE HOUSE
MEMBERS.
IN 2003, PARTLY BY WHAT WE'RE
GOING THROUGH SHE BECAME THE
FIRST SENATOR IN THE HISTORY OF
NEW YORK EVER TO SERVE ON THE
ARM TO SERVICES COMMITTEE. SO, SHE TRIED TO MAKE SURE
PEOPLE ON THE BATTLEFIELD HAD PROPER EQUIPMENT.
SHE TRIED TO EXPAND AND DATA
EXPAND HEALTH CARE COVERAGE TO MEMBERS OF THE NATIONAL GUARD.
SHE GOT LONGER FAMILY LEAVE
WORKING WITH SENATOR DODD FOR PEOPLE CARING FOR WOUNDED
SERVICEMEMBERS AND SHE WORKED FOR MORE EXTENSIVE CARE FOR PEOPLE WITH DRAMATIC BRAIN
INJURY.
SHE ALSO SERVED ON THE SPECIAL
AND TO GONE COMMISSION TO
PROPOSE CHANGES NECESSARY TO
MEET OUR NEW SECURITY
CHALLENGES. NEW TO GINGRICH WAS ON THAT
COMMISSION.
HE TOLD ME WHAT A GOOD JOB SHE
HAD DONE.
[LAUGHTER HE AND APPLAUSE] 
MR. CLINTON: I SAY THAT BECAUSE
NO ONE HAD SERIOUSLY DEALT WITH
THIS. THEY ARE A NATIONAL TREASURE. ALL RACES, ALL WALKS OF LIFE.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] MR. CLINTON: MEANWHILE, SHE
COMPILED A REALLY SOLID RECORD TOTALLY PROGRESSIVE ON ECONOMIC
AND SOCIAL ISSUES.
SHE VOTED FOR HIM AGAINST A
PROPOSED TRADE DEAL.
SHE BECAME THE EFFECT OF
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT OFFICER FOR
THE AREA OF NEW YORK OUTSIDE THE AMBIT OF NEW YORK CITY.
SHE WORKED FOR FARMERS, WINE MAKERS, SMALL BUSINESSES AND MANUFACTURERS. FOR UPSTATE CITIES AND RURAL
AREAS THAT NEEDED MORE IDEAS AND
INVESTMENT TO CREATE NEW JOBS. SOMETHING WE HAVE TO DO AGAIN IN
SMALL TOWN IN RURAL AMERICA IN
NEIGHBORHOODS THAT OF BEEN LEFT BEHIND AND INDIAN COUNTRY, AND YES -- IN COAL COUNTRY. WHEN SHE LOST THE CONTEST TO
PRESIDENT OBAMA, SHE WORKED FOR
HIS ELECTION HARD. AND, SHE HESITATED TO SAY YES WHEN HE ASKED HER TO JOIN HIS
EVIDENT. THE CUSHY SO LOVED BEING A SON
-- BECAUSE SHE'S SO LOVED BEING
A SENATOR FROM NEW YORK. SO LIKE ME BUT IN A DIFFERENT
CONTEXT, HE HAD TO KEEP ASKING. BUT AS WE ALL SAW, IT WAS WORTH THE EFFORT.
[APPLAUSE] MR. CLINTON: AS SECRETARY OF
STATE, SHE WORKED HARD TO GET
STRONG SANCTIONS AGAINST IRAN'S NUCLEAR PROGRAM AND WHAT WALL
STREET JOURNAL CALLED A HALF SHOT, SHE GOT RUSSIA INTO CHINA
TO SUPPORT.
HER TEAM NEGOTIATED A NEW TREATY WITH RUSSIA. SHE GOT ENOUGH REPUBLICAN
SUPPORT TO GET TWO THIRDS OF THE
SENATE TO VOTE NECESSARY TO
RATIFY THE TREATY. SHE SAT UP ALL NIGHT LONG FROM
CAMBODIA TO THE MIDDLE EAST TO
GET A CEASE-FIRE THAT WOULD
AVOID A SHOOTING WAR BETWEEN
GAZA AND -- I MEAN BETWEEN HAMAS
AND GAZA. TO PROTECT THE PEACE OF THE
REGION. SHE BACKED PRESIDENT OBAMA'S DECISION TO GO AFTER OF, SHE LAUNCHED A TEAM -- THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT TODAY -- SHE
LAUNCHED A TEAM TO FIGHT BACK AGAINST TERRORISTS ONLINE AND BUILT A NEW GLOBAL
COUNTERTERRORISM EFFORT.
WE HAVE GOT TO WIN THIS BATTLE. IN THE MIND FIELD. SHAPE OF CLIMATE CHANGE IN THE MIDDLE OF OUR POLICY.
SHE NEGOTIATED THE FIRST AGREEMENT WITH CHINA AND INDIA
TO REDUCE THEIR IN REMISSION. AND AS SHE HAD BEEN DOING SINCE YOU WENT TO BEIJING IN 1995 AND SAID, WOMEN'S RIGHTS ARE HUMAN
RIGHTS AND HUMAN RIGHTS ARE WOMEN'S RIGHTS -- SHE WORKED TO
EMPOWER WOMEN AND GIRLS AROUND
THE WORLD AND TO MAKE THE SAME EXACT DECLARATION ON BEHALF OF
THE LGBT COMMUNITY IN AMERICA AND AROUND THE WORLD. AND, NOBODY EVER TALKS ABOUT
THIS MUCH -- NOBODY EVER TALKS
ABOUT THIS MUCH BUT IT IS IMPORTANT TO ME, SHE TRIPLED THE
NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN FOUR
COUNTRIES WITH AIDS WHOSE LIVES
ARE BEING SAVED WITH YOUR TAX DOLLARS.
MOST OF THEM AFRICAN, GOING FROM 1.7 TRILLION MIDWIVES TO 5.1 MILLION LIVES AND IT DID NOT COST YOU ANY MORE MONEY.
SHE JUST BOUGHT AVAILABLE
FDA-APPROVED GENERIC DRUGS, SOMETHING WE NEED TO DO MORE FOR
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. NOW, YOU DO NOT KNOW ANY OF
THESE THINGS.
YOU DON'T KNOW ANY OF THESE THINGS ABOUT 3 MILLION, 4
MILLION PEOPLE.
AND I GUARANTEE, THEY KNOW YOU.
THEY KNOW YOU BECAUSE THEY SEE YOU AS THINKING THEIR LIVES
MATTER. THEY KNOW YOU, AND THAT IS ONE
REASON THE APPROVAL IN THE
UNITED STATES WAS 20 POINTS
HIGHER WHEN SHE LEFT THE
SECRETARY OF STATE'S OFFICE THE
END WHEN SHE TOOK IT. NOW, HOW DOES THIS SQUARE?
HOW DOES THIS SQUARE WITH THE THINGS THAT YOU HEARD AT THE
REPUBLICAN CONVENTION? WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE IN WHAT I
TOLD YOU AND WHAT THEY SAID?
HOW DO YOU SQUARED?
YOU CANNOT.
ONE IS REAL, THE OTHER IS MADE UP.
[LAUGHTER, CHEERS, AND APPLAUSE] MR. CLINTON: AND -- YOU JUST HAVE TO DECIDE WHICH IS
WHICH, MY FELLOW AMERICANS. THE REAL ONE HAD DONE MORE CHANGE MAKING -- POSITIVE CHANGE
MAKING BEFORE SHE WAS
30-YEARS-OLD THAN MOST POLITICIANS DO WITH THEIR WHOLE
LIVES IN OFFICE.
THE REAL ONE, IF YOU SAW HER FRIEND -- HAS FRIENDS FROM CHILDHOOD IN ARKANSAS WHERE SHE IS NOT LIVED FOR MORE THAN 20 YEARS WHO HAVE GONE ALL ACROSS AMERICA AT THEIR OWN EXPENSE TO FIGHT FOR THE PERSON THEY KNOW. THE RED ONE -- THE RED ONE HAS
EARNED THE LOYALTY AND RESPECT
OF PEOPLE OF WORKED WITH HER IN EVERY STAGE OF HER LIFE,
INCLUDING LEADERS AROUND THE WORLD WHO KNOW HER TO BE ABLE, STRAIGHTFORWARD, AND COMPLETELY
TRUSTWORTHY. THEY WERE ONE CALLS YOU WHEN
YOU'RE SICK, WHEN YOUR KIDS ARE
IN TROUBLE, OR WHEN THERE IS A
DEATH IN THE FAMILY. THE REAL ONE REPEATEDLY GETS PRAISE FROM PROMINENT
REPUBLICANS WHEN SHE WAS A
SENATOR AND THE SECRETARY OF
STATE.
[APPLAUSE] MR. CLINTON: SO, WHAT IS UP WITH THIS?
WELL, IF YOU WIN ELECTIONS, ON THE THEORY THE GOVERNMENT IS
ALWAYS BAD AND WILL MESS UP A TWO-INCORPORATED, A REAL CHANGEMAKER REPRESENTS A REAL THREAT.
-- A TWO-CAR PARADE, IT REAL
CHANGEMAKER REPRESENTS A REAL
THREAT.
SO YOUR ONLY ALTERNATIVE IS TO CREATE A CARTOON. CARTOONS ARE TWO-DIMENSIONAL. EASY TO ABSORB.
LIFE IN THE WORLD IS COMPLICATED
AND REAL CHANGE IS HARD.
A LOT OF PEOPLE THINK IT IS
BORING EVEN. GOOD FOR YOU, BECAUSE EARLIER TODAY YOU NOMINATED THE REAL
ONE.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] MR. CLINTON: YOU -- 
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] MR. CLINTON: WE HAVE TO GET BACK ON SCHEDULE -- LOOK, I HAVE
LIVED A LONG, FULL, BLESSED
LIFE. IT REALLY TOOK OFF WHEN I MET AND FELL IN LOVE WITH THAT GIRL
IN THE SPRING OF 1971. WHEN I WAS PRESIDENT I WORKED HARD TO GIVE YOU PEACE AND SHARED ASPERITY, TO GIVE YOU AN AMERICA WHERE NOBODY IS IN
VISIBLE OR COUNTED OUT.
BUT, FOR THIS TIME HILLARY IS UNIQUELY QUALIFIED TO SEIZE THE
OPPORTUNITIES AND REDUCE THE
RISKS WE FACE AND SHE IS STILL
THE BEST DARN CHANGEMAKER I HAVE EVER KNOWN.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] MR. CLINTON: YOU COULD DROP HER IN ANY TROUBLE SPOT. PICK ONE. COME BACK IN A MONTH AND
SOMEHOW, SOME WAY, SHE WILL HAVE
MADE IT BETTER. THAT IS JUST WHO SHE IS. THERE ARE CLEAR, ACHIEVABLE, AFFORDABLE RESPONSES TO OUR CHALLENGES.
BUT WE WILL NOT GET TO THEM IF
AMERICA MAKES THE WRONG CHOICE
IN THIS ELECTION. THAT IS WHY YOU SHOULD ELECT HER
. IN DUE SHOULD ELECT HER BECAUSE
SHE WILL NEVER QUIT WHEN THE GOING GETS TOUGH.
SHE WILL NEVER QUIT ON YOU. SHE SENT ME IN THIS PRIMARY TO WEST VIRGINIA, WHERE SHE KNEW WE WERE GOING TO LOSE TO LOOK THOSE
COAL MINERS IN THE EYE AND SAY
"I AM DOWN HERE BECAUSE HILLARY
SENT ME TO TELL YOU THAT IF YOU
REALLY THINK YOU CAN GET THE ECONOMY BACK THAT YOU HAD 50 YEARS AGO, GO FOR IT. THAT IF SHE WINS, SHE IS COMING
BACK FOR YOU TO TAKE YOU ON THE
RIDE TO AMERICA'S FUTURE." 
AND SO I SAY TO YOU, IF YOU LOVE THIS COUNTRY AND ARE WORKING HARD, PAYING TAXES, OBEYING THE LAW, AND WANT TO BECOME A
CITIZEN YOU SHOULD CHOOSE
IMMIGRATION REFORM OVER SOMEBODY
WHO WANTS TO SEND YOU BACK.
IF YOU ARE A MUSLIM AND YOU LOVE AMERICA AND FREEDOM INTO HATE
TERROR, STAY HERE AND HELP US WIN AND MAKE THE FUTURE TOGETHER.
WE WANT TO YOU.
-- WE WANT TO YOU. IF YOU ARE A YOUNG AFRICAN-AMERICAN DISILLUSIONED AND AFRAID, WE SAW IN DALLAS HOW GREAT OUR POLICE OFFICERS CAN
BE. HELP US BUILD A FUTURE WHERE
NOBODY IS AFRAID TO WALK OUTSIDE
INCLUDING THE PEOPLE WHO WEAR
BLUE TO PROTECT OUR FUTURE. HILLARY WILL MAKE US STRONGER
TOGETHER. YOU KNOW IT BECAUSE SHE SPENT A
LOT OF TIME DOING IT. I HOPE YOU WILL DO IT.
I HOPE YOU WILL ELECT HER.
THOSE OF US HAVE MORE YESTERDAYS THAN TOMORROW'S TENDED TO CARE
MORE ABOUT OUR CHILDREN AND ARE
IN CHILDREN REASON YOU SHOULD ELECT HER IS IS THE GREATEST
COUNTRY ON EARTH WE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN ABOUT TOMORROW. YOUR CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN
WILL BLESS YOU FOREVER IF YOU
DO. GOD BLESS YOU. THANK YOU.
