<p class='short_transcript'> >> LIKE MILLIONS OF AMERICANS, I'M LIVING WITH MENTAL ILLNESS. BUT I'M LUCKY, I HAVE THE
RESOURCES AND SUPPORT TO GET
TREATMENT AT A TOP FACILITY. UNFORTUNATELY,<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> TOO MANY
AMERICANS FROM ALL WALKS OF LIFE
DON'T GET HELP. EITHER BECAUSE THEY FEAR THE
STIGMA OR CANNOT AFFORD TREATMENT. UNTREATED MENTAL ILLNESS CAN LEAD TO DEVASTATING
CONSEQUENCES, INCLUDING SUICIDE,
SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND LONG-TERM
MEDICAL ISSUES. WE CAN DO BETTER. EVERYONE OF US CAN MAKE A
DIFFERENCE. BY GETTING EDUCATED ON THIS EPIDEMIC AND HIS FRIGHTENING
STATISTICS AND BY BREAKING THE STIGMA, I URGE EVERY POLITICIAN TO SUPPORT LAWS THAT WILL
PROVIDE ACCESS TO BETTER HEALTH
CARE AND SUPPORT FOR EVERYONE.
[CHEERING] THIS IS NOT ABOUT POLITICS, IT
IS SIMPLY THE RIGHT THING TO DO.
I'M DOING MY VERY SMALL PART BY
HAVING THE TREATMENT CENTER THAT SAW MR. MY RECOVERY ON TOUR WITH
ME SO THAT AT LEAST A SOCCER BUT
PEOPLE, EVEN FOR A BRIEF MOMENT
CAN HAVE THE SAME SUPPORT THAT I
RECEIVED. IT MAY NOT BE A LOT, BUT WE HAVE
TO BELIEVE EVERY SMALL ACTION
COUNTS. I STAND HERE TODAY AS PROOF THAT
YOU CAN LIVE A NORMAL AND EMPOWERED LIFE WITH MENTAL
ILLNESS. I'M PROUD TO SUPPORT A
PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE WILL
FIGHT TO ENSURE ALL PEOPLE
LIVING WITH MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS GET THE CARE THEY NEED TO LEAD CIVILIAN LIVES. THAT CANDIDATE IS HILLARY
CLINTON.
[CHEERING] LET'S MAKE HER THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
OF AMERICA.
