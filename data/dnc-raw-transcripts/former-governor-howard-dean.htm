<strong>Howard Dean M.D.</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> THANK YOU. THANK YOU. DEMOCRATS, INDEPENDENTS, AND THE
MILLIONS OF REPUBLICANS WHO DON'T RECOGNIZE THE PARTY THEY SAW AND HEARD IN CLEVELAND AND
CANNOT<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> SUPPORT THEIR PARTY'S NOMINEE FOR PRESIDENT AND VICE
PRESIDENT. 25 YEARS AGO, I GOT TO KNOW
HILLARY CLINTON WHEN SHE WORKED
TO ACHIEVE A GOAL THAT WAS A
GOAL A CENTURY AGO, A GOAL OF HARRY TRUMAN'S TO GIVE US ALL
UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE. BETWEEN THE ASPIRATIONS OF HARRY
TRUMAN AND THE ACCOMPLISHMENT OF
BARACK OBAMA, THERE WAS HILLARY, POISED AND PERSISTENT. WHEN HER FIRST ATTEMPT AT HEALTH CARE DID NOT WORK OUT, HILLARY
COULD HAVE GIVEN UP.
INSTEAD, SHE FOUGHT THE WAY SHE
ALWAYS DID. SHE DID HER HOMEWORK, SHE
PERSEVERED, SHE NEVER FORGOT WHO
SHE WAS FIGHTING FOR AND THANKS
TO HER EFFORTS, THE STATE
CHILDREN HEALTH INSURANCE
PROGRAM WAS BORN AND SHE WORKED
A JUST AS HARD TO ENSURE THE
STATES ACTUALLY SIGNED UP. JOINING WITH REPUBLICAN
GOVERNORS TO GET IT DONE. TODAY, MORE THAN 8 MILLION CHILDREN HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE
AS A RESULT. THAT IS 8 MILLION CHILDREN WHOSE FAMILIES DON'T HAVE TO CHOOSE
BETWEEN PAYING THE RENT AND
TAKING THEM TO THE DOCTOR. WHEN PRESIDENT OBAMA TOOK OFFICE, HE PICKED UP THE FIGHT
AND WITH THE AFFORDABLE HEALTH
CARE ACT PASSED, WE EXPANDED INSURANCE TO 20 MILLION MORE
PEOPLE. TODAY, 90% OF AMERICANS ARE COVERED AND WE HAVE MADE SO MUCH PROGRESS. AND NOW, WE NEED TO ELECT THE PERSON WHO WILL FINISH THE JOB, HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON.
[APPLAUSE] HAS A PLAN TO DRIVE DOWN HEALTH
CARE COST, HILLARY HAS A PLAN TO STANDARD TO THE DRUG COMPANIES AND LOWER PRESCRIPTION DRUG PRICES, AND HILLARY HAS A PLAN TO TAKE UP THE LAST MILE AND FINALLY, ACHIEVE HEALTH CARE FOR
ALL AMERICANS. THAT IS WHAT HILLARY WILL DO. NOW DONALD TRUMP HAS A PLAN TOO. HE WOULD RIP UP OBAMA CARE AND
THROW 20 MILLION PEOPLE OFF THERE HEALTH INSURANCE. THAT WILL TAKE US BACK TO A TIME
WHEN INSURANCE COMPANIES CAN
DENY YOU COVERAGE IF YOU HAVE A
PRE-EXISTING CONDITION. OR HE WILL TAKE YOU BACK TO THE
TIME WHEN INSURANCE COMPANIES COULD CHARGE YOU MORE JUST
BECAUSE YOU ARE A WOMAN. AND WHAT IS HE GOING TO REPLACE THIS WITH?
"SOMETHING SO MUCH BETTER." THAT'S IT. THAT'S THE WHOLE PLAN FOR HEALTH
CARE. HIS VICE PRESIDENTIAL PICK IS NO
BETTER.
MIKE PENCE VOTED AGAINST
EXPANDING THE CHILDREN HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM, WHICH HILLARY HELPED START. MIKE PENCE VOTED TO END MEDICARE
AS WE KNOW IT. BY THE WAY, MIKE PENCE ONCE SAID
THAT WHEN BOTH PARENTS WORK,
CHILDREN END UP FACING "STUNTED EMOTIONAL GROWTH."
[BOOING] I HAVE A MEDICAL DEGREE AND LET
ME TELL YOU WHAT REALLY STUNTS CHILDREN'S GROWTH, NOT HAVING ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE, INADEQUATE FUNDING FOR PRESCRIPTION PROGRAMS, GUNS, THE
ULTIMATE PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS.
[APPLAUSE] CIGARETTES. I YOUR GOVERNOR PENCE MISSED THE
MEMO BUT THEY DO IN FACT CAUSE
CANCER, GOVERNOR, AND NO AMOUNT OF TOBACCO MONEY CONTRIBUTIONS TO YOUR CAMPAIGN CAN SAY THAT, GOVERNOR.
[APPLAUSE] THE CHOICE IN THIS ELECTION IS
CLEAR. WE NEED A PRESIDENT WHOSE
DECISIONS ARE ROOTED IN THE FACTS.
WE NEED A PRESIDENT WHO WILL
DEFEND OUR INTERESTS AROUND THE
WORLD AND WHO KNOWS WHAT IT
TAKES TO DEFEAT AND DESTROY ISIS NOT WITH IGNORANT BLUSTER AND
BOMBAST BUT WITH A TOUGHNESS AND RESOLVE.
WE NEED A PRESIDENT WHO WILL ENSURE WE PLAY BY THE SAME RULES
AS HARD-WORKING MIDDLE-CLASS
AMERICANS. AND WE NEED A PRESIDENT WHO WILL NEVER STOP FIGHTING TO ENSURE
THAT UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE IS A
BASIC HUMAN RIGHT AND IF THAT IS
THE PRESIDENT WE WANT, IF THAT
IS THE AMERICA WE BELIEVE IN, THEN DO NOT RATE -- WAIT UNTIL
NOVEMBER TO MAKE YOUR VOICE
HEARD. GO TO HILLARYCLINTON.COM TO DONATE RIGHT NOW. HELP MAKE HISTORY AND VOLUNTEER BECAUSE THIS RACE IS GOING TO BE
ONE ON THE GROUND AND IT WILL BE
ONE ON THE GROUND IN IOWA, NORTH
CAROLINA, MICHIGAN, FLORIDA, PENNSYLVANIA AND THEN WE ARE
GOING TO THE WHITE HOUSE.

<strong>Elizabeth Banks</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> I DIRECTED PITCH PERFECT TWO
IN WHICH THE BARDEN VELEZ WENT TO THE WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP SO I
KNOW A THING OR TWO ABOUT WORLD
AFFAIRS. BUT I STILL HAVE<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> A LONG WAY TO
GO TO CATCH HILLARY CLINTON. AS OUR SECRETARY OF STATE, OUR NATION'S CHIEF DIPLOMAT, SHE TRAVELED TO 112 COUNTRIES AND FLEW NEARLY ONE MILLION MILES. WHY DID SHE TAKE THE JOB? FOR THE FANCY TITLE? NO.
FOR THE NICE OFFICE? NO.
FOR THE FREQUENT FLYER MILES? PROBABLY. SHE TOOK THE JOB BECAUSE WE NEEDED SOMEONE TO FIGHT TO MAKE
AMERICA AND THE WORLD SAFE.
SOMEONE TOUGH AND SMART WHO SIT ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE TABLE
FROM RUSSIA, FROM CHINA, FROM CANADA. HILLARY CLINTON USED HER OFFICE TO BRING NEW FOCUS AND ATTENTION
TO SEX TRAFFICKING, HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES, AND THE PLIGHT OF WOMEN
AND GIRLS ALL OVER THE WORLD.
HILLARY CLINTON DID NOT YELL, SHE DID NOT INSULT ANYONE, SHE WENT INTO THE ROOM WITH A CLEAR
AND STEADY VISION FOR THE FUTURE
AND SHE GOT RESULTS.</span><span class='hidden-full-transcript-ellipses'>...</span></p><a href='#' class='hidden-full-transcript-link'><i class='icon-chevron-down'></i> <span class='link-show-full-text'>Show Full Text</span><i class='icon-chevron-up'></i> <span class='link-show-less-text'>Show Less Text</span></a>
