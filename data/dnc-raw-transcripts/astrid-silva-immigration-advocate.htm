<strong>Astrid Silva</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> WHEN I WAS FOUR YEARS OLD, MY
MOTHER AND I CLIMBED INTO A RAFT
AND WE CROSSED THE RIVER TO JOIN
MY FATHER IN AMERICA.
IN SEARCH OF A BETTER LIFE.
ALL<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> I HAD WAS A LITTLE DULL.
-- DOL I GREW UP LIKE AN
ORDINARYL. EARL. MY DAD WAS A LANDSCAPER AND MY
MOM STAYED AT HOME. WHILE MY FRIENDS AND ORDINARY THINGS, I COULD NOT. BECAUSE MY PARENTS WERE AFRAID
THAT SOMEONE MIGHT DISCOVER I
WAS UNDOCUMENTED. MY FAMILY BELIEVED SO DEEPLY IN
THE PROMISE OF THIS COUNTRY THAT WE RISKED EVERYTHING FOR THE AMERICAN DREAM. AS AN UNDOCUMENTED STUDENT, I
FELT LIKE COLLEGE WAS OUT OF
REACH. AFTER A JOURNEY ATTENDERS, I
FINALLY GRADUATED FROM NEVADA STATE COLLEGE.
[CHEERING] MY FAMILY AND I ARE HERE BECAUSE OF PEOPLE LIKE SENATOR HARRY
REID.
[CHEERING] MI ABUELITO WHO PUT THEMSELVES
IN OUR SHOES AND HELPED US. AND WHILE PRESIDENT OBAMA'S
IMMIGRATION ACT OF PROTECTED ME,
WE LIVE IN CONSTANT.
THAT MY PARENTS COULD BE TAKEN
AWAY FROM THEIR GRANDSON.
WHEN DONALD TRUMP TALKS ABOUT DEPORTING 11 MILLION PEOPLE, HE IS TALKING ABOUT RIPPING FAMILIES APART, SEPARATING FAMILIES LIKE MINE AND CARLOS,
HILLARY CLINTON UNDERSTANDS THAT THIS IS NOT WHO WE ARE AS A
COUNTRY. I HAVE SEEN HER COMFORT CHILDREN LIKE CARLA WHO ARE SCARED THAT
THEY MIGHT LOSE THEIR PARENTS TO
DEPORTATION.
I KNOW SHE  WILL FIGHT TO KEEP
HER VILLAGE TOGETHER.
-- OUR FAMILIES TOGETHER. NUESTRA FAMILIA. I KNOW SHE WILL.
