<strong>Pam Livengood</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> HELLO. FOR MY 50TH BIRTHDAY I GOT A
TWO-YEAR-OLD. YOU SEE MY DAUGHTER AND MY BOYFRIEND -- HER BOYFRIEND HAD A
DUTIFUL BOY.
THEY GOT CAUGHT UP IN JUGS.
--<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> DRUGS.
IT STARTED WITH PAIN MEDICATION
SHE WAS GIVEN AFTER FRANCIS WAS
BORN.
AND IT JUST GOT WORSE. IT IS HARD TO POINT JUST HOW DEVASTATING IT IS TO WATCH HER
CHILD STRUGGLE WITH SUBSTANCE ABUSE. I KNOW MY DAUGHTER LOVES FRANCIS, BUT LOVE IS NOT ENOUGH TO TAKE CARE OF HIM. I STARTED GETTING CALLS FROM CHILD SERVICES AND ONE DAY,
GRANTS US WOULD BE TAKEN AWAY
FROM MY FAMILY AND PUT IN FOSTER CARE UNLESS HE HAD FAMILY WHO
COULD TAKE CARE OF HIM. THERE WAS NO WAY WE WERE GOING TO LET OUR GRANDSON AND UP IN
FOSTER CARE. SO FRANCIS LIVED WITH MY HUSBAND JOHN AND I UNTIL HE WAS FIVE. HE LIVES WITH HIS GRANDFATHER NOW ON DISABILITY. WHEN YOU ARE MY AGE, YOU DON'T
EXPECT TO START ALL OVER AGAIN
RAISING A GRANDCHILD. TODAY, MY DAUGHTER IS IN TREATMENT BUT SHE HAS A LONG
ROAD AHEAD OF HER. MY STORY IS NOT UNIQUE. THIS EPIDEMIC HAS DEVASTATED
COMMUNITIES ALL OVER THE COUNTRY
, IT DOES NOT DISCRIMINATE
AGAINST AGE, RACE, GENDER OR INCOME.
IT AFFECTS ALL OF US. BUT SOMETIMES IT FEELS LIKE
FOLKS IN WASHINGTON DON'T HEAR
THE STORIES. LAST YEAR, HILLARY CLINTON CAME
TO NEW HAMPSHIRE FOR A
ROUNDTABLE AT MY WORKPLACE AND SHE ASKED IF ADDICTION HAD
TOUCHED ANY OF US. AS I TOLD MY STORY, HILLARY
LISTENED. SHE EVEN TOOK NOTES. AND SHE DID SOMETHING ELSE WE
DON'T SEE A LOT OF IN WASHINGTON, SHE TOOK ACTION. SHE CAME UP WITH A PLAN, ONE THAT INCLUDES EVERYTHING FROM
REDUCING OVERDOSES TO EXPANDING
ASPECTS STUDENT -- ACCESS TO
TREATMENT. THAT IS THE KIND OF LEADER WE
NEED. WE NEED A LEADER WHO LISTENS TO
THE VOICES OF ORDINARY AMERICANS
, A LEADER WHO TREATS PEOPLE WITH COMPASSION AND RESPECT.
A LEADER WHO BELIEVES THAT AS AMERICANS, WE LOOK OUT FOR EACH
OTHER. I'M NOT SAYING THAT LEADER HAS
TO BE A GRANDMOTHER, BUT IT SURE HELPS. FOR ME, THAT LEADERS WHO ARE CLINTON.
[CHEERING]
-- LEADER IS HILLARY CLINTON.
