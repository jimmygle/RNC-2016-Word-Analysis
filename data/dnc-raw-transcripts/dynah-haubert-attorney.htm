<p class='short_transcript'> >> AFTER HILLARY GRADUATED FROM
LAW SCHOOL, SHE COULD HAVE
GOTTEN A JOB ANYWHERE BUT SHE
CHOSE TO WORK FULL-TIME FOR THE CHILDREN'S DEFENSE FUND. SHE<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> WENT DOOR-TO-DOOR GATHERING
STORIES FROM DISABLED CHILDREN WHO DESPERATELY WANTED TO GO TO SCHOOL BUT WERE PREVENTED FROM
ENROLLING BY DISCRIMINATION.
HER RESEARCH CONTRIBUTED TO THE PASSAGE OF THE HISTORIC LEGISLATION THAT REQUIRED STATES
TO WRITE QUALITY EDUCATION FOR
DISABLED STUDENTS. AS A DISABLED PERSON, I BECAME A
LAWYER TO ADVOCATE THAT VISIBILITY -- DISABILITY IS NOT
A PROBLEM TO BE CURED BUT A PART
OF OUR IDENTITY AND DIVERSITY.
[APPLAUSE] AND THAT IS WHY TODAY ON THE
26TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT,
I'M WITH HER.

<p class='short_transcript'> >> UNTIL THE 1970'S, YOUNG
PEOPLE WHO GOT IN TROUBLE IN
SOUTH CAROLINA WERE HOUSED IN
THE SAME PRISON CELLS AS ADULTS.
IT WAS A DANGEROUS POLICY THAT
PUT<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> KIDS AT SERIOUS RISK FOR
ABUSE. THE CHILDREN'S DEFENSE FUND SENT
HILLARY TO THESE PRISONS TO
INVESTIGATE.
AS A RESULT, THE STATE ENDED THIS PRACTICE. FROM THE MOMENT A CHILD TOUCHES THE SYSTEM, IT'S IMPORTANT TO
NOT LET THEM FALL BEHIND. THAT IS WHY I BECAME A JUVENILE JUSTICE LAWYER.
YOU DON'T OFTEN MAKE HEADLINES
FIGHTING FOR KIDS BUT HER WHOLE
CAREER, HILLARY HAS BEEN QUIETLY LEADING THAT SITE ANYWAY.
THAT IS WHY I'M WITH HER.
