<strong>Unidentified Speaker</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> THANK YOU.
THANK YOU VERY, VERY MUCH. MY FELLOW DEMOCRATS, AND HELLO SOUTH CAROLINA. AS A FATHER OF THREE DAUGHTERS AND GRANDFATHER OF TWO ADORABLE<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> GRANDDAUGHTERS, I AM PROUD TO
STAND BEFORE YOU AS WE PREPARE
FOR THE ULTIMATE OPPORTUNITY, TO SMASH THE GLASS CEILING BY
NOMINATING FOR PRESIDENT OF THE
UNITED STATES THE PERSON WHO IS MOST QUALIFIED, EXPERIENCED THAN ANYONE EVER UP FOR THE JOB. AND WHEN IT COMES TO CURRENT OCCUPANTS, IT AIN'T EVEN CLOSE. THE CHANGES WE SEEK FOR OUR
COUNTRY, TO ACHIEVE A STRONGER
AND BETTER AMERICA, WE NEED A
LEADER WHO IS WILLING TO FIGHT
FOR THE DREAMS OF ALL AMERICANS.
IF THERE IS ONE THING I KNOW
ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON, IT IS
THIS. SHE IS A FIGHTER. AND SHE FIGHTS WITH HER HEAD IN
HER HEART. IN MY HOME STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA, WE OFTEN SAY THAT YOU CAN BEST TELL WHAT A PERSON WILL
DO BY LOOKING AT WHAT HE OR SHE
HAS DONE. WHEN SHE GRADUATED FROM LAW
SCHOOL, HILLARY CLINTON CAME TO
SOUTH CAROLINA TO HELP REFORM
OUR JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM AND TRAVELED ACROSS THE REGION TO MAKE THE 1965 VOTING RIGHTS ACT
REAL IN THE LIVES OF ALL AMERICANS.
IN ARKANSAS, SHE SOUGHT TO REFORM EDUCATION. AS FIRST LADY, SHE FOUGHT FOR
UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE AND HELPED SECURE THE CHILDREN'S HEALTH
CARE PROGRAM THAT PROVIDES
HEALTH CARE FOR MILLIONS OF
CHILDREN AND LAID THE GROUNDWORK
FOR THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT.
AS A CITIZEN OF , AND AS
SECRETARY OF STATE, HILLARY
CLINTON ALWAYS WORKED TO ADVANCE
OUR NATION'S PURSUIT OF A MORE
PERFECT UNION.
HILLARY CLINTON KNOWS THAT SHE
MUST TAKE EFFECTIVE ACTION ON
THE ISSUE OF INCOME INEQUALITY. SHE HAS EMBRACED THE BLACK
CAUCUS IS 2030 PLAN TO TARGET CHILDREN IN AREAS OF PERSISTENT
POVERTY.
HILLARY CLINTON'S FIRST SPEECH
IN THIS CAMPAIGN WAS ON CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM.
SHE WILL WORK TO GET RID OF MANDATORY MINIMUMS AND MASS INCARCERATION, AND PRIVATE, FOR-PROFIT PRISONS. HILLARY CLINTON DOES NOT CARE
ABOUT GOING OUTSIDE HER COMFORT
ZONE. SHE KNOWS WE ARE A STRONGER
NATION WHEN WE WORKED TOGETHER. SHE EMBODIES THE NATION'S MOTTO, E PLURIBUS UNUM, OUT OF MANY,
ONE. JOHN F. KENNEDY CHALLENGED US TO
REACH FOR THE MOON. AND WE DID. LYNDON BAINES STRACHAN SON --
LYNDON BAINES JOHNSON TACKLED INEQUALITY AND POVERTY IN
AMERICA AND HIS ACHIEVEMENTS
CONTINUE TO LIVE ON AND SUSTAIN
OUR CITIZENS.
DR. MARTIN LUTHER KING JR. BROUGHT US TO THE MOUNTAINTOP,
AND ALTHOUGH WE ARE NOT THERE
YET, WE ARE STILL CLIMBING, AND
WITH PRESIDENT HILLARY CLINTON,
AMERICA HAS ARRIVED EVEN FURTHER
. MY STANDING BEFORE YOU TONIGHT
IS A TESTAMENT TO THE STRENGTH
OF OUR PARTY, THE GOODNESS OF
OUR PEOPLE, AND THE GREATNESS OF
OUR NATION.
OUR NATION IS STRONG, BUT WE CAN
BE STRONGER. AMERICANS ARE GOOD, BUT WE CAN BE BETTER. AMERICA IS GREAT, BUT IT CAN BE
GREATER.
MY FELLOW DEMOCRATS, AMERICA'S BRIGHTEST DAYS ARE YET TO COME. WE HAD HER AND BETTER THINGS TO
ACHIEVE, BUT ACHIEVING EAGER AND BETTER THINGS REQUIRES WORKING TOGETHER AND WORKING HARDER. LET'S EMERGE FROM PHILADELPHIA
TOGETHER TO MAKE OUR NATION STRONGER, AMERICA BETTER AND AMERICA GREATER BY ELECTING HILLARY CLINTON THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THESE UNITED STATES. GOD BLESS EACH AND EVERY ONE OF
YOU AND GOD BLESS THESE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.
THANK YOU.
