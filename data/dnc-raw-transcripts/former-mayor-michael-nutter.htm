BROTHERLY LOVE AND SISTERLY
AFFECTION<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> IN THE AIR. FOR EIGHT YEARS, I WAS PRIVILEGED TO SERVE AS THE MAYOR
OF THIS GREAT AMERICAN CITY, PHILADELPHIA. I'M VERY PROUD THAT MY ADMINISTRATION AND OUR HOST COMMITTEE BROUGHT OUR CONVENTION TO PHILADELPHIA. I HOPE YOU HAD A GREAT TIME. PHILADELPHIA IS MY TOWN. I GREW UP HERE. I BUILT MY CAREER AND RAISE MY FAMILY HERE.
SO IT IS WITH TREMENDOUS PRIDE
THAT HERE IN A CITY KNOWN FOR ITS HISTORY I CAST MY BALLOT FOR
OUR HISTORIC NOMINEE, HILLARY
CLINTON.</span><span class='hidden-full-transcript-ellipses'>...</span></p><a href='#' class='hidden-full-transcript-link'><i class='icon-chevron-down'></i> <span class='link-show-full-text'>Show Full Text</span><i class='icon-chevron-up'></i> <span class='link-show-less-text'>Show Less Text</span></a>

MANY YOUNG BLACK MEN WHO ARE PRECIOUS TO OUR COUNTRY AND ITS FUTURE. WHAT'S MORE, HILLARY'S PLAN HAS

WHEN YOU ARE LOOKING DOWN AT AMERICA FROM THE TOP OF TRUMP TOWER, YOU CAN SEE THE DETAILS,
