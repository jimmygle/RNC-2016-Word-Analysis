<strong>Eva Longoria</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> EVA: HELLO PHILADELPHIA! I AM SO HONORED TO BE HERE TONIGHT AND I AM PROUD TO SAY I AM WITH HER.
[APPLAUSE] AND CHEERS -- EVA: LIKE MANY OF YOU, THIS
ELECTION<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> IS VERY PERSONAL TO ME.
I AM FROM A SMALL TOWN IN SOUTH
TEXAS.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] EVA: IF YOU KNOW YOUR HISTORY, TEXAS USED TO BE PART OF MEXICO. NOW, I AM NOT GENERATION
AMERICAN. MY FAMILY NEVER CROSSED THE
BORDER. THE BORDER CROSSED US. SO, WHEN DONALD TRUMP CALLS US CRIMINALS AND RAPISTS HE IS INSULTING OF FAMILIES. MY FATHER IS NOT A CRIMINAL OR A
RAPIST, IN FACT HE IS A UNITED STATES VETERAN.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] 
EVA: WHEN TRUMP CRUELLY MOCKED
THE DISABLED REPORTER HE WAS ALSO MOCKING MY SPECIAL NEEDS SISTER AT AND MANY LIKE HER.
WHEN HE SAID THAT A WIFE WHO
WORKS IS A VERY DANGEROUS THING,
HE NOT ONLY INSULTED ME HE INSULTED MY MOTHER WHO WORKED AS A SPECIAL EDUCATION TEACHER FOR
30 YEARS, RAISED FOUR CHILDREN WHILE BEING A WIFE. YOU KNOW, I BELIEVE IN ME CANDIDATE WHO BELIEVES IN ALL OF
US AND THAT CANDIDATE IS HILLARY CLINTON.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THE EVA: HILLARY HAS SPENT HER
WHOLE LIFE FIGHTING FOR ALL
AMERICANS.
FROM HEALTH-CARE REFORM TO EQUAL
PAY FOR WOMEN TO GUN SAFETY TO PROTECTING THE ECONOMY.
SHE IS THE MOST QUALIFIED PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE EVER.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] EVEN: SHE IS BEEN FIGHTING FOR
US FOR DECADES AND NOW IT IS
TIME WE FIGHT FOR HER. NOW, I AM VERY PROUD TO BE PART OF THAT FIGHT AND I AM VERY PROUD TO BE HEARD TO INTRODUCE
MY DEAR FRIEND CORY BOOKER. BUT, BEFORE I DO I WANT YOU TO
TAKE A LOOK AT YOUR CONVENTION,
PHILADELPHIA. A LATINA FROM SOUTH TEXAS IS INTRODUCING THE FIRST BLACK SENATOR FROM NEW JERSEY ON THE WEEK WE WILL NOMINATE TO OUR FIRST FEMALE CANDIDATE FOR
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] IN EVA: PRETTY GREAT.
SO GUESS WHAT DONALD, IT TURNS OUT AMERICA IS PRETTY GREAT
ALREADY. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, PLEASE WELCOME SENATOR CORY BOOKER.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

<strong>Cory Booker</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> SEN. BOOKER: HELLO PHILADELPHIA!
THANK YOU. THANK YOU.
THANK YOU. THANK YOU.
[CROWD CHANTING] SEN. BOOKER: THANK YOU.
THINK YOU.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
240<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> YEARS AGO, OUR FOREFATHERS
GATHERED IN THIS VERY CITY AND THEY DECLARED TO BE FOR THE
WORLD THAT WE WOULD BE A FREE
AND INDEPENDENT NATION. TODAY WE GATHER HERE AGAIN IN THE CITY, IN THIS CITY OF BREWER
-- BROTHERLY LOVE TO REAFFIRM OUR VALUES BEFORE THE NATION AND
THE WHOLE WORLD. MY PURPOSE IS NOT LIKE THERE'S TO START A GREAT NATION, BUT TO ENSURE THAT WE CONTINUE IN THE BEST OF OUR TRADITION. AND, WITH HUMBLE HOMAGE TO
GENERATIONS AND PATRIOTS BEFORE.
WE PUT FORTH TO GREAT AMERICANS. OUR NOMINEE FOR PRESIDENT AND VICE PRESIDENT, HILLARY CLINTON
AND TIM KAINE.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] SEN. BOOKER: NOW, LOOK AT THAT CORE HISTORY.
LOOKING BACK TO OUR FOUNDING
FATHERS. PUT FORTH FOUNDING DOCUMENTS THAT WERE INDEED GENIUS. BUT THE FOUNDING DOCUMENTS WERE
NOT GENIUS BECAUSE THEY WERE
PERFECT. THEY WERE SADDLED WITH THE
IMPERFECTIONS AND EVEN THE BIGOTRY OF THE PAST. NATIVE AMERICANS WERE REFERRED
TO AS SAVAGES.
BLACK AMERICANS WERE FRACTIONS OF HUMAN BEINGS.
AND, WOMEN WERE NOT MENTIONED AT
ALL. BUT THOSE UGLY PARTS OF OUR
HISTORIES DO NOT DISTRACT FROM OUR NATION'S GREATNESS.
AND FACT, I BELIEVE WE ARE IN EVEN GREATER NATION NOT BECAUSE
WE STARTED PERFECT BUT THE COUSIN EVERY GENERATION HAS SUCCESSFULLY LABORED TO MAKE US A MORE PERFECT UNION.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] SENATOR BOOKER: GENERATIONS OF
HER ROGUE AMERICANS HAVE MADE
OUR NATIONS MORE INCLUSIVE. MORE EXPANSIVE. AND, MORE JUST.
OUR NATION WAS NOT FOUNDED
BECAUSE WE ALL LOOK ALIKE OR
PRAYED ALIKE OR DESCENDED FROM THE SAME FAMILY TREE. WHAT OUR FOUNDERS, IN THEIR GENIUS, AND THIS, THE OLDEST CONSTITUTIONAL DEMOCRACY ON THE
PLANET EARTH, THEY PUT FORTH THE
IDEA THAT ALL ARE CREATED EQUAL. THAT WE HAVE IN ALIENABLE RIGHTS
. AND I AM SO PROUD THAT IT WAS
UPON THIS FOUNDATION THAT WE BUILD A GREAT NATION AND TODAY, NO MATTER WHO YOU ARE, RICH OR POOR, ASIAN OR WHITE, MAN OR
WOMAN, GAY OR STRAIGHT, ANY RELIGION OR NONE AT ALL, YOU ARE ENTITLED TO THE CIVIL RIGHTS AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF CITIZENSHIP. IN THIS CITY, OUR FOUNDERS PUT FORTH A DECLARATION OF
INDEPENDENCE BUT LET ME TELL YOU, AND THAT ALSO MADE IT -- A HISTORIC INDEPENDENCE. THEY KNEW THAT IF THIS COUNTRY
WAS TO SURVIVE AND THRIVE, WE
HAD TO MAKE AN UNUSUAL AND EXTRAORDINARY COMMITMENT TO EACH
OTHER. LOOK, I RESPECT AND VALUE THE
IDEALS OF INDIVIDUALS AND
SELF-RELIANCE. BUT RUGGED INDIVIDUALISM DID NOT
THE FEET DEEP BRITISH.
IT DID NOT GET US TO THE MOON.
IT DID NOT BUILD OUR NATION'S HIGHWAYS.
RUGGED INDIVIDUALISM DID NOT MAP THE HUMAN GENOME. WE DID THAT TOGETHER.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] SEN. BOOKER: SAID THIS IS THE HIGH CALL OF PATRIOTISM.
PATRIOTISM IS LOVE OF COUNTRY
BUT YOU CANNOT LOVE YOUR COUNTRY
WITHOUT LOVING YOUR COUNTRYMEN
ENTER COUNTRYWOMEN.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] 
SEN. BOOKER: WE DO NOT ALWAYS
HAVE TO AGREE BUT WE MUST BE THERE FOR EACH OTHER. WE MUST EMPOWER EACH OTHER. WE MUST FIND COMMON GROUND AND WE MUST BUILD BRIDGES ACROSS OUR DIFFERENCES TO PURSUE THE COMMON
THAT.
LET ME TELL YOU, WE CANNOT DEVOLVE INTO A NATION WHERE OUR HIGHEST ASPIRATION IS THAT WE
TOLERATE EACH OTHER. WE ARE NOT CALLED TO BE A NATION OF TOLERANCE. WE'RE CALLED TO BE A NATION OF LOVE.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] SEN. BOOKER: THAT IS WHY THE
LAST LINE OF THE DECLARATION OF
INDEPENDENCE SAYS IT SO CLEARLY.
IT SAYS TO MAKE THIS NATION WORK
WE MUST MUTUALLY LATCHED TOGETHER OUR LIVES, OUR
FORTUNES. TOLERANCE IS THE RUNWAY. TOLERANCE SAYS, I AM GOING TO
STOMACH YOUR RIGHT TO BE
DIFFERENT. IF YOU'D DISAPPEAR FROM THE FACE
OF THE EARTH I AM NO BETTER OR
WORSE. BUT LOVE, LOVE KNOWS THAT EVERY
AMERICAN HAS WORTH AND VALUE SO
NO MATTER WHAT YOUR BACKGROUND, AND A MATTER WHAT THEIR RACE OR
RELIGION OR SEXUAL ORIENTATION, LOVE, LOVE RECOGNIZES WE NEED TO
EACH OTHER.
THAT TO WE AS A NATION ARE BETTER TOGETHER. DIVIDED WE ARE WEAK.
WHEN WE ARE UNITED WE ARE
STRONG, WHEN WE ARE INDIVISIBLE, WE ARE INVINCIBLE. THIS -- THIS -- THIS IS THE UNDERSTANDING OF
LOVE. THAT IS EMBODIED IN ONE OF MY
FAVORITE SAYINGS. IT IS AN AFRICAN SAYING AND IT
SAYS, IF YOU WANT TO GO FAST GO
ALONE. IF YOU WANT TO GO FAR, GO
TOGETHER.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] SEN. BOOKER: THIS IS THE REASON I'M SO MOTIVATED IN THIS
ELECTION BECAUSE I BELIEVE THIS
ECS BEST AND BODIES THE LEADERSHIP WE NEED TO GO FAR TOGETHER. DONALD TRUMP IS NOT THAT LEADER. WE HAVE WATCHED HIM. TRY TO GET LAUGHS AT OTHER
PEOPLES EXPENSE. TRY TO INCITE FEAR AT A TIME WE NEED TO INSPIRE COURAGE.
TRY TO RISE IN THE POLLS BY
DRAGGING OUR NATIONAL
CONVERSATION INTO THE GUTTER.
WE HAVE WATCHED HIM MOCK, CRUELLY MOCK, A JOURNALIST ROSS
DISABILITIES.
WE HAVE WATCHED HIM DO MEAN THE SERVICE OF MY COLLEAGUES SAYING
HE IS NOT A WAR HERO.
HE WAS A WAR HERE BECAUSE HE WAS CAPTURED.
JOHN SAID, I DO NOT LIKE PEOPLE TO GET CAPTURED. WHEN YOU SAY THAT TO POWS FROM
WORLD WAR II, WHEN YOU SAY THAT TO POWS FROM VIETNAM, WOULD HE
SAY THAT TO THE BRAVE MEN AND
WOMEN IN IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN RIGHT NOW RISKING CAPTURE OR WORSE QUESTION MARK THAT IS NOT THE COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF. WE HAVE WATCHED DONALD TRUMP PAINT WITH A BROAD BRUSH SAYING THAT MEXICAN IMMIGRANTS WHO CAME
TO BUILD A BETTER LIFE IN AMERICA ARE IN HIS WORDS, BRINGING CRIME, BRINGING DRUGS.
HE CALLED MANY OF THEM RAPISTS. HE SAYS THAT AN INDIAN-BORN FEDERAL JUDGE CANNOT BE TRUSTED TO DO HIS JOB BECAUSE OF HIS MEXICAN ANCESTRY.
A STATEMENT THAT HIS FELLOW REPUBLICANS HAVE TO -- WE HAVE WATCHED DONALD TRUMP, I WERE CHILDREN, OUR GRANDKIDS HAVE WATCHED DONALD TRUMP AND HEARD HIM CALLING WOMEN DEGRADING AND DEMEANING NAMES. DOGS. FED PIGS. DISGUSTING ANIMALS.
IT IS A TWISTED HYPOCRISY WHEN HE TREATS OTHER WOMEN IN A MANNER HE WOULD NEVER, EVER
ACCEPT FROM ANOTHER MAN SPEAKING
ABOUT HIS DAUGHTER OR HIS WIFE.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] SEN. BOOKER: IN THIS GREAT
NATION WHERE OUR NATION FOUNDERS PUT A FUNDAMENTAL CORE OF
RELIGIOUS FREEDOM, HE SAYS BAN ALL MUSLIMS. DO NOT LET CERTAIN PEOPLE INTO AMERICA BECAUSE OF HOW THEY
PRAYED. I TAKE AN INTEREST IN THE FACT
TRUMPS SAYS HE WOULD RUN OUR
COUNTRY LIKE HE RUNS HIS
BUSINESSES. WELL, I AM FROM JERSEY.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] CORY BOOKER: AND I AM FROM THE
GREAT GARDEN SAY AND WE SEE -- GREAT GARDEN STATE AND WE SEE HOW HE LEADS IN ATLANTIC CITY. HE GOT RICH WHILE HIS COMPANY DECLARED MULTIPLE BANKRUPTCY, YET WITHOUT REMORSE, EVEN AS
PEOPLE GOT HURT AND LOST JOBS
THROUGH HIS FAILURE HE BRAGGED
AND I QUOTE, THE MONEY I TOOK
OUT OF THERE WAS INCREDIBLE. YES, HE TOOK OUT A LOT OF CASH.
THAT HE STIFFED CONTRACTORS,
MANY OF THEM SMALL BUSINESSES.
REFUSING TO PAY THEM FOR THE
WORK THEY HAD DONE. WE IN AMERICA HAVE SEEN ENOUGH
OF A HANDFUL OF PEOPLE GETTING
RICH AT THE COST OF A NATION
DESCENDING INTO CRISIS. AMERICA AT OUR BEST, WE STAND UP
TO BULLIES.
AND WE FIGHT THOSE WHO SEEK TO
DEMEAN AND DEGRADE OTHER AMERICANS.
AND TIMES OF CRISIS, WE DO NOT ABANDON OUR VALUES.
WE DOUBLE DOWN ON THEM.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] 
SEN. BOOKER: EVEN IN THE MIDST
OF THE CRISIS OF THE CIVIL WAR, LINCOLN TOOK OFFICE AND CALLED OUT TO ALL OF OUR COUNTRY
SAYING, WITH MALICE TOWARDS NON-AND CHARITY TOWARDS ALL. THIS IS OUR HISTORY. THIS IS A HISTORY WAS TAUGHT RIGHT PARENTS. MY PARENTS NEVER WANTED MY
BROTHER AND I TO GET TO HEADY FROM THE GRAVITY SAID THEY NEVER STOPPED SHOWING US THAT WE GOT
OUR FREEDOM BY ORDINARY
AMERICANS WHO SHOWED EXTRAORDINARY KINDNESS, DECENCY,
AND LOVE.
PEOPLE WHO SWEAT AND BLED FOR OUR RIGHTS.
PAID THE ULTIMATE PRICE FOR THE
FREEDOMS WE ENJOY.
I WAS TOLD WE CANNOT PAY THOSE AMERICANS BACK FOR THEIR
COLOSSAL ACTS OF COURAGE BUT WE HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO PAY IT
FORWARD TO OTHERS THROUGH OUR
SERVICE AND OUR SACRIFICE. I SUPPORT HILLARY CLINTON
BECAUSE SHE'S -- THESE ARE HER
VALUES AND SHE HAS BEEN PAYING
IT FORWARD HER ENTIRE LIFE. LONG BEFORE SHE GOT IN POLITICS, SHE WAS IN MASSACHUSETTS GOING DOOR-TO-DOOR COLLECTING THE
STORIES OF CHILDREN'S WITH
DISABILITIES. IN SOUTH CAROLINA, SHE FOUGHT TO
REFORM THE JUSTICE SYSTEM SO
THAT CHILDREN WOULD NOT BE BROUGHT INTO ADULT PRISONS. AND ALABAMA, SHE HAS EXPOSED THE
REMNANTS OF SEGREGATION. AND ARKANSAS, SHE STARTED AND EIGHT -- AND THE -- A LEGAL AID CLINIC TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE CAN GET THEIR DAY IN COURT. SHE DELIVERS.
THAT IS WHY WE TRUST HER TO
FIGHT IN TO DELIVER FOR US AS PRESIDENT.
LET ME TELL YOU, WE HAVE A PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE IN CLINTON
WHO KNOWS THAT AND A TIME OF
STUNNINGLY WIDE DISPARITY OF THE WEALTH IN OUR NATION, AND AMERICA'S GREATNESS MUST NOT BE
MEASURED BY HOW MANY MILLIONAIRES AND BILLIONAIRES WE HAVE THAT HOW FEW PEOPLE WE HAVE
LIVING IN POVERTY. HILLARY KNOWS THAT WHEN WORKERS MAKE A FAIR WAGE IT DOES NOT
JUST HELP THEIR FAMILY AT BILLS
A MORE STRONGER AND HERBAL
ECONOMY THAT EXPANDS OPPORTUNITY
AND MAKES ALL AMERICANS
WEALTHIER.
SHE KNOWS IN A GLOBAL KNOWLEDGE-BASED ECONOMY, THE
COUNTRY THAT OUT-EDUCATES THE
WORLD WILL OUT-OUR NEW WORLD, OUT-INNOVATE THE WORLD, AND WILL LEAD THE WORLD. SHE KNOWS THE DEBT-FREE COLLEGE IS NOT A GIFT, IT IS NOT
CHARITY, IT IS IN INVESTMENT THAT REPRESENTS THE BEST OF OUR VALUES. THE BEST OF OUR INTERESTS.
AND THE BEST OF OUR PARTIES. OUR SHARED IDEALS AND VALUES TOGETHER. HILLARY CLINTON KNOWS THAT WHEN WE HAVE PAID FAMILY LEAVE, THIS
IS SOMETHING THAT MUST HAPPEN BECAUSE WHEN A PARENT DOES NOT
HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN BEING THERE FOR A SICK CHILD AND PAYING RENT, WHEN A SINGLE MOM EARNS AN EQUAL WAGE FOR EQUAL
WORK, IT EMPOWERS THE MOST
IMPORTANT BUILDING BLOCK IN ALL
OF OUR NATION AND THAT IS THE
FAMILY. HILLARY CLINTON KNOWS THAT
SECURITY DOES NOT COME FROM SCAPEGOATING OTHER PEOPLE BECAUSE OF THEIR RELIGION. ALIENATING OUR ALLIES. STOKING FEAR. POINTING FINGERS. IT COMES WHEN WE BAND TOGETHER TO FACE DOWN AND DEFEAT OUR
COMMON ENEMIES AND SHE KNOWS SOMETHING I FIGHT FOR EVERY DAY,
THAT OUR TERMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM
DESPERATELY NEEDS REFORM. WE NEED TO BRING BACK FAIRNESS TO A SYSTEM THAT IS FILLED, AS PROFESSOR BRIAN STEVENSON SAID, YOU DO BETTER IF YOU'RE RICH AND
GUILTY THE IMPORT AND INNOCENT. SHE KNOWS WE CAN BE A NATION THAT BELIEVES POLICE OFFICERS USER MORE RESPECT, MORE SUPPORT,
MORE COOPERATION AND LOVE AND
BELIEVES THAT A BLACK, 20-SOMETHING PROTESTER DESERVES TO BE VALUED, DESERVES TO BE
HEARD, THEY SHOULD BE LISTENED
TO WITH MORE COURAGEOUS EMPATHY AND THAT CHANGE IS NEEDED IN THE
SYSTEM.
AND HILLARY CLINTON KNOWS WHAT DONALD TRUMP BETRAYS TIME AND AGAIN AND HIS CAMPAIGN, THAT WE ARE NOT A ZERO-SOME NATION. IT IS NOT YOU OR ME. IT IS NOT ONE AMERICAN AGAINST ANOTHER AMERICAN.
IT IS YOU AND I TOGETHER. INTERDEPENDENT, INTERCONNECTED, WITH ONE SINGLE INTERWOVEN DESTINY. WHEN WE RESPECT EACH OTHER, STAND UP FOR EACH OTHER, WORK TOGETHER AGAINST ALL CHALLENGES,
AGAINST OUR NEIGHBORS
CHALLENGES, BE IT A NEIGHBOR
WITH A BEAUTIFUL SPECIAL NEEDS
CHILD OR ONE STRUGGLING WITH THE
UGLY DISEASE OF ADDICTION, WHEN
WE AS AMERICANS HELP THEM, WHEN WE SHOW COMPASSION AND GRACE, WHEN WE EVIDENCE OUR TRUTH THAT WE ARE THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, ONE NATION UNDER GOD
INDIVISIBLE, THAT IS WHEN WE ARE
STRONGER. THAT IS WHEN WE BUILD FROM AN
ALREADY GREAT AMERICA TO AND EVEN GREATER AMERICA.
"CHEERS AND APPLAUSE -- [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]] 
>> ONE TRUMPS SPEWS INSULTING
WORDS ABOUT AMERICANS, I THINK
ABOUT A POEM BY VIA ON JALEEL.
YOU KNOW IT.
-- MAYA ANGELOU YOU MAY TRIED ME IN THE DUST,
BUT STILL, LIKE DUST, I RISE. YOU ALL KNOW IT. YOU ALL KNOW IT. THIS CAPTURES OUR AMERICAN
HISTORY. 240 YEARS AGO AND ENGLISH KING
SAID HE WOULD CRUSH OUR REBELLION BUT AMERICANS FROM
AROUND THE NATION JOINED THE
FIGHT FROM BUNKER HILL TO THE
BATTLE OF TRENTON. SO MANY FELL.
GIVING THEIR LIVES IN SUPPORT OF
OUR DECLARATION THAT AMERICA WILL RISE.
THIS IS OUR HISTORY. THIS IS OUR HISTORY. KNOWING THAT LIBERTY IS NOT SECURE FOR SOME UNTIL IT IS SECURE FOR ALL. SOMETIMES HUNDREDS, OFTEN HUNTED, THEY LOOKED UP TO THE
NORTH STAR AND SAID WITH A DETERMINED WHISPER, AMERCO WE
WILL RISE.
-- OF AMERICA, WE WILL RISE. IMMIGRANTS RISKING THEIR LIVES
IN TIMES OF CHILD LABOR. THEY ORGANIZED CHILD LABOR AND DEMOTED THEMSELVES TO LIFTING
THE POOR IN HUDDLED MASSES.
WITH VOICES OF GREAT, THEY
SHOUTED WITH VOICES ALL COULD
HEAR -- AMERICA, WE WILL RISE. KENNEDY POINTED TO THE MOVE.
FROM SENECA FALLS TO THOSE WHO STOOD AT STONEWALL IN, GIANTS
BEFORE US SAID, IN ACCORDANCE
AND CONVICTION, AMERCO WE WILL
RISE. MY FELLOW AMERICANS, MY FELLOW AMERICANS, WE WILL NOT FALL INTO
THE COMPLACENCY OR INDIFFERENCE ABOUT THIS ELECTION BECAUSE STILL, THE ONLY THING NECESSARY FOR EVIL TO BE TRIUMPHANT IS FOR
GOOD PEOPLE TO DO NOTHING.
YOU KNOW WHAT I'M SAYING.
MY FELLOW AMERICANS, WE CANNOT
THE SEDUCED ABOUT OUR POLITICS WITH CITIZEN IS HIM. THAT IS A RECIPE FOR COWARDICE AND THIS MUST ALWAYS BE THE HOME OF THE BRAVE.
WE ARE THE UNITED STATES OF
AMERICA. WE WILL NOT FALTER OR FALL OR RETREAT OR SURRENDER OUR VALUES. WE WILL NOT SURRENDER OUR
IDEALS.
WE WILL NOT SURRENDER THE MORAL HIGH GROUND.
HERE IN PHILADELPHIA, LET US
DECLARE AGAIN WE WILL BE A FREE PEOPLE. FREE FROM FEAR AND INTIMIDATION.
LET US DECLARE WE ARE A NATION
OF INTERDEPENDENCE AND THAT
AMERICA LOVES -- AND THAT IN
AMERICA LOVE ALWAYS TRUMPS HATE. LET US DECLARE SO THAT
GENERATIONS YET UNBORN CAN HEAR
US. WE ARE THE UNITED STATES OF
AMERICA. OUR BEST DAYS ARE AHEAD OF US. AND TOGETHER, WITH HILLARY CLINTON IS OUR PRESIDENT, AMERICA, WE WILL RISE! GOD BLESS AMERICA.
LET'S RISE TOGETHER.
