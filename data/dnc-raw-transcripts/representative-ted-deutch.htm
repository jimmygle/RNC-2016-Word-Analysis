<strong>Unidentified Speaker</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> IN 2008, BEFORE I CAME TO CONGRESS, MY WIFE GOTAND I GO
TO MEET HILLARY CLINTON. MORE IMPORTANTLY, OUR TWO
DAUGHTERS GOT TO MEET HER.
THEY WERE 12<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> YEARS OLD. THEY SHOWED HILLARY THESE CUTE DOLLS OF THEIRS, DOLLS THAT WERE
SHIRTS THAT READ "SUNDAY, A WOMAN SOME DAY, A WOMAN WILL BE PRESIDENT."
NOT JUST A DREAM OF MY
DAUGHTERS, IT WAS ALSO A DREAM
OF MY MOTHER'S. UNFORTUNATELY, SHE PASSED AWAY
IN DECEMBER. IN ONE OF OUR LAST CONVERSATIONS, SHE TALKED ABOUT
HOW EXCITED SHE WAS TO LIVE TO SEE A WOMAN PRESIDENT, AND AND 91, SHE KNEW WHAT HER
GRANDDAUGHTERS 12, THAT ELECTING HILLARY CLINTON IS NOT ABOUT MAKING HISTORY, IT'S ABOUT CREATING A
FUTURE. IT'S NOT ABOUT ELECTING A WOMAN,
IT'S ABOUT ELECTING THIS WOMAN,
WHO WILL CREATE OPPORTUNITY FOR
ALL OF US.</span><span class='hidden-full-transcript-ellipses'>...</span></p><a href='#' class='hidden-full-transcript-link'><i class='icon-chevron-down'></i> <span class='link-show-full-text'>Show Full Text</span><i class='icon-chevron-up'></i> <span class='link-show-less-text'>Show Less Text</span></a>

<p class='short_transcript'> >> THAT'S THE OPPORTUNITY THAT
MY DAD FOUGHT FOR WHEN HE SERVED
IN WORLD WAR II AND EARNED A
PURPLE HEART AT THE BATTLE OF
THE BULGE. AND IT IS WHAT I<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> AM FIGHTING FOR
WHEN I SERVE THE GREAT PEOPLE OF
SOUTH FLORIDA IN CONGRESS, INCLUDING -- INCLUDING SO MANY MEMBERS OF THE GREATEST
GENERATION. NOW, WE ALL HAVE TO FIGHT FOR
THE ONLY CANDIDATE WHO WILL PROTECT THE SOCIAL SECURITY AND
MEDICARE THAT OUR SENIORS HAVE EARNED AND NOT SLASH IT. WHO WILL GET UNLIMITED MONEY OUT
OF POLITICS AND NOT ENCOURAGE IT. WHO WILL ALWAYS STAND BY ISRAEL AND THE JEWISH COMMUNITY AND NOT
DEFEND IT.
-- NOT OVER AND IT. AND WHO WILL STAND UP TO THE NRA AND NEVER -- WE HAVE TO START
FIGHTING RIGHT NOW. SO TO FIND OUT HOW YOU CAN HELP, TEXT FL TO 47246. WE HAVE TO VOTE THIS  NOVEMBER AND OCTOBER. IF YOU ARE LUCKY ENOUGH TO LIVE
IN A STATE LIKE FLORIDA, THAT
LETS YOU EARLY VOTE OR VOTE BY MAIL, WHEN HILLARY CLINTON MET
MY DAUGHTERS SHE SIGNED HER NAME
ON THE SHIRTS THEIR DOLLS WERE
WEARING. THIS YEAR, MY DAUGHTERS ARE OLD
ENOUGH TO VOTE IN THEIR FIRST
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION, AND WHEN
THEY LOOK AT THEIR BALLOTS, THEY
WILL SEE THAT SAME NAME, HILLARY CLINTON, AND THEY WILL PROUDLY
MARK THE BOX NEXT TO IT. THIS OCTOBER, MY DAUGHTERS WILL
CAST THEIR FIRST EARLY VOTES FOR AMERICA'S FIRST WOMAN PRESIDENT.</span><span class='hidden-full-transcript-ellipses'>...</span></p><a href='#' class='hidden-full-transcript-link'><i class='icon-chevron-down'></i> <span class='link-show-full-text'>Show Full Text</span><i class='icon-chevron-up'></i> <span class='link-show-less-text'>Show Less Text</span></a>
