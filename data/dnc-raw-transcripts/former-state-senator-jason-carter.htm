<strong>Jason J. Carter</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> GREETINGS FROM THE
BATTLEGROUND STATE OF GEORGIA. WHEN MY GRANDFATHER ACCEPTED THE
DEMOCRATIC NOMINATION FOR PRESIDENT, HE STOOD BEFORE THIS
GROUP<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> AND SAID THAT IT IS TIME
FOR AMERICA TO SPEAK AND NOT WITH BELLIGERENCE, BUT WITH A QUIET STRENGTH, TO DEFEND
AMERICA NOT WITH AN ARSENAL, BUT
WITH THE NOBILITY OF IDEAS, TO
COVER NOT WITH CONFUSION AND CRISIS, BUT WITH GRACE,
IMAGINATION, AND COMMON SENSE. THOSE WORDS FEEL EVEN MORE
RELEVANT TODAY THAN THEY DID 30
YEARS AGO, AND I PROMISE, YOU
WILL SEE HIM GET ON THE CAMPAIGN
TRAIL TO HELP ELECT HILLARY
CLINTON.
THIS PAST YEAR HAS BEEN A REMARKABLE ONE IN OUR FAMILY.
ALMOST EXACTLY A YEAR AGO, MY
GRANDFATHER WAS DIAGNOSED WITH
CANCER. HE APPROACHED THIS DIAGNOSIS WITH THE FAITH, DIGNITY, AND STRENGTH WE HAVE COME TO EXPECT.
HE NEVER STOPPED WORKING FOR
HEALTH AND PEACE AROUND THE
WORLD, AND HE NEVER STOPPED TEACHING SUNDAY SCHOOL AT HOME.
TODAY, THANKS TO THE MIRACLE OF
SCIENCE AND THE POWER OF PRAYER,
I AM PROUD TO REPORT THAT THE
CANCER IS GONE. AND NOT ONLY THAT, EARLIER THIS
MONTH, HE AND MY GRANDMOTHER CELEBRATED THEIR 70TH WEDDING ANNIVERSARY. THEY DEMONSTRATE THAT THERE IS STRENGTH IN LOVE, HUMILITY, AND SERVICE, THAT NO AMOUNT OF ANGER, PRIDE, OR SALESMANSHIP CAN MATCH.
THAT PRINCIPLED STRENGTH IS WHAT
DRIVES THEM IN THE WORK THEY DO EVERY DAY, AND THAT SAME PRINCIPLED STRENGTH WILL ELECT
HILLARY CLINTON IS OUR NEXT
PRESIDENT.</span><span class='hidden-full-transcript-ellipses'>...</span></p><a href='#' class='hidden-full-transcript-link'><i class='icon-chevron-down'></i> <span class='link-show-full-text'>Show Full Text</span><i class='icon-chevron-up'></i> <span class='link-show-less-text'>Show Less Text</span></a>

<strong>Jimmy Carter</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> GOOD EVENING, DEMOCRATS. 46 YEARS AGO, I STOOD BEFORE YOU TO ACCEPT YOUR NOMINATION AS
PRESIDENT. WE WISH WE COULD BE THERE
TONIGHT TO HELP PREPARE<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> FOR WHAT WILL BE AN EXTREMELY IMPORTANT ELECTION, ONE THAT WILL DEFINE FOR A GENERATION WHO WE ARE AS A
NATION AND A PEOPLE.
I FEEL PROUD THAT OUR TWO DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES, WHO
COMPETED THROUGHOUT A LONG PRIMARY SEASON, COMPORTED THEMSELVES WITH MIDI, TALKED ABOUT ISSUES THAT MATTER, AND
PRESENTED A VISION -- WITH DIGNITY, TALKED ABOUT ISSUES
THAT MATTER, AND PRESENTED A
VISION FOR OUR NATION.
YOUNG AMERICANS, STAY ENGAGED, THEY INVOLVED, AND BE SURE TO
VOTE THIS NOVEMBER. IT HAS BECOME MORE IMPORTANT
THAN EVER TO LIFT PEOPLE UP TO A BRIGHTER FUTURE. INSTEAD, WE SEE A REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE WHO SEEMS TO REJECT THE MORAL AND ETHICAL
PRINCIPLES ON WHICH OUR NATION
WAS FOUNDED.
WE CAN AND MUST DO BETTER. WE WILL SOON BE CHOOSING
BETWEEN STARK CONTRASTS IN STYLE
AND EXPERIENCE.
I HAVE KNOWN HILLARY CLINTON FOR DECADES. WHEN SHE WAS A YOUNG ATTORNEY, I
APPOINTED HER TO THE LEGAL
SERVICES CORPORATION, WHERE SHE
BECAME THE FIRST WOMAN CHAIR. THERE, HILLARY FOUGHT TO MAKE
SURE THAT IN OUR COURTS, THOSE
WITH THE LEAST WERE TREATED THE
SAME AS THOSE WITH THE MOST. SINCE THEN, HILLARY HAS ALWAYS DEMONSTRATED A WILLINGNESS TO TAKE ON DIFFICULT CHALLENGES AND TO GET THINGS DONE.
HER LIFE HAS BEEN DEDICATED TO
ADVANCING HUMAN RIGHTS ACROSS THE GLOBE, ESPECIALLY FOR WOMEN
AND CHILDREN. THESE ARE PERILOUS TIMES, THAT NEED SOMEONE WITH A STRONG
HEART, A DEEP UNDERSTANDING OF ISSUES, AND A STRONG HAND.
-- AND A STEADY HAND. HILLARY CLINTON HAS MY SUPPORT,
AND I KNOW SHE HAS YOURS. THANK YOU ALL, AND GOD BLESS THE
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.
>> PLEASE WELCOME SENATOR CHUCK SCHUMER FROM NEW YORK.
