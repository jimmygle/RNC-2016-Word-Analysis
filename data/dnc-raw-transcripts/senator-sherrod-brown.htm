<strong>Father William Byron</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> FRIENDS ALL, RECENT WEEKS
HAVE BROUGHT VIOLENCE AND SENSELESS KILLINGS TO THIS NATION, AND I'M THINKING IN
PARTICULAR OF BATON ROUGE AND DALLAS.
IT<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> JUST INTRIGUES ME THAT THE DALLAS ASSASSIN MORE THAN NAME MICA AND XAVIER. SO I'M GOING TO BORROW FROM THE WORDS OF THE PROPHET MICAH AND THE GREAT ST. FRANCIS XAVIER IN MAKING THIS INVOCATION.
LET'S BE MINDFUL THAT WE ARE IN
GOD'S PRESENCE AS WE PRAY. LORD GOD, CREATOR AND RULER OF THE UNIVERSE, WE INVOKE YOUR
BLESSING ON THIS ASSEMBLY, MINDFUL THAT YOU HOLD OUR DESTINY IN YOUR HANDS. LIFE ITSELF IS YOUR GIFT TO US.
WHAT WE DO WITH OUR LIVES IS OUR GIFT TO YOU. SO BLESS US, WE PRAY, AS WE LOOK
TO THE FUTURE OF THIS NATION.
KEEP US FREE FROM HATRED AND VIOLENCE.
PROTECT US FROM CONFUSION, AND
MAKE THE WORDS OF FRANCIS XAVIER OUR OWN, XAVIER WHO SAID, IN
YOU, LORD, HAVE I PUT MY HOPE. LET ME EVER BE CONFOUNDED. AND WE TURN TO YOUR GREAT PROFIT, MICAH, TO LISTEN TO YOU
SPEAK THE WORDS THAT HE PASSED
ON TO US.
YOU HAVE BEEN TOLD, OLD MAN, A WOMAN, WHAT IS GOOD, AND WHAT THE LORD REQUIRES A FEW, ONLY TO DO JUSTICE, TO LOVE GOODNESS, AND TO WALK HUMBLY WITH YOUR GOD
. SO HELP US, LORD, TO WORK UNCEASINGLY FOR JUSTICE, TO KNOW
WHAT IS GOOD, AND TO SEEK IT WITHOUT FAIL, AND TO BE TRULY HUMBLE AS WE WALK WITH YOU INTO AN UNKNOWN BUT HOPE FILLED FUTURE. AMEN.

<p class='short_transcript'> >> GOOD AFTERNOON. I LIVE IN ATLANTA, GEORGIA AND I SERVE AS THE COFOUNDER, TOGETHER
WITH MORE THAN ONE MILLION AMERICANS, I AM LIVING WITH HIV. WHEN<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> THE HIV-AIDS EPIDEMIC FIRST
EMERGED IN THE 1980'S, I WAS NOT
BORN YET. IT WAS A MYSTERIOUS VIRUS, THEN
A DEADLY ONE TOO. IT SEEMED TO BE PICKING OFF GAY
MEN ONE BY ONE, ESPECIALLY BLACK
AND LATINO. THE COMMUNITY SPOKE OUT TO THAT
POLICYMAKERS WOULD TAKE NOTICE. AND WHILE SUMMONING THEIR VOICES, HILLARY CLINTON
LISTENED. SHE ADVOCATED FOR THE INCREASED FUNDING FOR PREVENTION AND RESEARCH AS FIRST LADY. THEN WORKED TO INCREASE THE
FUNDING IN THE SENATE. SHE DESCENDED -- DEFENDED THE
RHYME WHITE CARE ACT AND
EXPANDED RESEARCHERS IN TESTING AND EDUCATION.
AS SECRETARY OF STATE, HILLARY
HELPED TO ENSURE THAT 6.7
MILLION PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD
GOT ACCESS TO ANTIRETROVIRAL THERAPY. AND SHE CRACKS DOWN ON THE STIGMA AROUND THE VIRUS AND
HELPED LIFT THE TRAVEL BAN WITH
THE HELP OF THE CONGRESSIONAL BLACK CAUCUS WHICH PRESENTED
PEOPLE WITH HIV-AIDS FROM -- WHICH PREVENTED PEOPLE WITH HIV-AIDS FROM ENTERING THE
COUNTRY. THE NUMBER OF NEW HIV AIDS
DIAGNOSES ARE ON THE DECLINE. IN THE U.S. BY NEARLY 20% OF THE LAST DECADE FOR CERTAIN POPULATIONS. WE KNOW HOW TO PREVENT THE VIRUS
NOW. WE KNOW HOW TO DIAGNOSE THE VIRUS NOW. WE KNOW HOW TO TREAT IT AND WE
KNOW HOW TO SUPPRESS IT. WE HAVE LEARNED ALL ABOUT WITHIN
MY LIFETIME. BUT STILL, THERE ARE MANY LIVING WITH HIV.
AND SO MANY OTHERS ARE. AND YOU ARE MOST AT RISK? YOUNG GAY BLACK MEN. MEN LIKE ME. IN FACT ONE INTO GAY BLACK MEN
-- ONE IN TWO GAY BLACK MEN WILL BE DIAGNOSED WITH HIV AND THE
LIFETIME IF CURRENT RATES CONTINUE.
IF WE HAVE ENOUGH DATA, I'M SURE
BLACK TRANSGENDER WOMEN ARE MORE
AT RISK TOO. WHAT CAN WE DO TO FIGHT HIV-AIDS TODAY?
WE INVEST IN RESEARCH AND EDUCATION.
EXPENSE TREATMENT AND
PREVENTION. AND WE ELECT HILLARY CLINTON.
[APPLAUSE] WITH HILLARY CLINTON AS OUR PRESIDENT, I BELIEVE THAT WE CAN
MEET OUR GOALS OF AN AIDS FREE GENERATION. AS AN ORGANIZER, AS A BLACK
MAN, AS A GAY MAN, AND AS A MAN
LIVING WITH HIV, I ASK YOU TO GO
GET TESTED, THEN GO IN THE. THANK YOU.

<strong>Neera Tanden</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> GOOD AFTERNOON. IT'S TRULY AN HONOR FOR ME TO
ADDRESS THIS CONVENTION. BECAUSE FRANKLY, I WOULD NOT BE HERE WITHOUT THE POLICIES OF THE
DEMOCRATIC<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> PARTY. MY PARENTS GOT DIVORCED WHEN I
WAS FIVE YEARS OLD.
MY FATHER LEFT FOR A TIME, IN MY
MOTHER HAD TO BE ON WELFARE. SHE WORKED HARD TO SUPPORT ME
AND MY BROTHER. WE ALSO HAD HELP. A LOT OF HEALTH. WE USED LUNCH OF VOUCHERS AT
SCHOOL AND FOOD STAMPS AT THE SUPERMARKET. AFTER WE MOVED OUT OF OUR HOUSE,
A FEDERAL SUBSIDY LETTUCE TO GET AN APARTMENT AND STAY IN A TOWN WITH GOOD PUBLIC SCHOOLS.
[APPLAUSE] IT WASN'T EASY, BUT WE
EVENTUALLY GOT BACK ON OUR FEET
BECAUSE OF THE INVESTMENT
DEMOCRATS HAVE MADE IN STRUGGLING FAMILIES. FAMILIES LIKE MINE. SO I KNOW FIRSTHAND THAT THE
DECISIONS OUR LEADERS MAKE MAKES
ALL THE DIFFERENCE IN PEOPLE'S
LIVES. THAT IS WHY I DIRECT PUBLIC POLICY, AND THAT IS WHY I AM SO
VERY PROUD TO SUPPORT HILLARY CLINTON. FOR DECADES, HILLARY HAS
CAMPAIGNED ON ISSUES THAT MATTER
TO WORKING FAMILIES. CHILDCARE, PAID LEAVE, EQUAL
PAY. BUT SHE DOESN'T JUST TALK THE TALK. SHE WALKS THE WALK. I KNOW BECAUSE I WORKED FOR HER
AND I STARTED MY OWN FAMILY. I WORKED FOR AN INTENSE SENATOR
WHEN MY DAUGHTER WAS YOUNG. NO MATTER HOW BUSY HILLARY GOT,
SHE ALWAYS MADE FAMILY FLEXIBILITY A REALITY FOR HER
STAFF. ONCE SHE FLIPPED HER ENTIRE
TRAVEL SCHEDULE SO I COULD MAKE
IT TO MY DAUGHTER'S PRE-K A
GRADUATION. IN FACT, HILLARY WAS THE SECOND PERSON TO CALL ME IN THE HOSPITAL WHEN MY BIRTH CHILD WAS
BORN. AND SHE WAS THE FIRST PERSON TO
CALL ME WHEN MY SECOND CHILD WAS
BORN. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT SAYS ABOUT MY FAMILY, BUT I KNOW WHAT IT SAYS ABOUT HILLARY. SHE IS THERE FOR PEOPLE. SHE HAS HER BACK.
-- HAS YOUR BACK. WHAT YOU DO, NOT JUST WHAT YOU SAY, NOT AS. FOR HILLARY, POLITICS IS ABOUT
FIGHTING FOR PEOPLE, NOT WHEN THE CAMERAS ARE ON, BUT WHEN
THEY ARE OFF. BUT WHEN THE DECISIONS ARE EASY,
BUT WHEN THEY ARE HARD. SHE IS A LEADER WE CAN HAVE FAITH IN.
SHE WILL BE A PRESIDENT WE CAN COUNT ON TO ALWAYS. LET'S DO THIS IN  NOVEMBER.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.</span><span class='hidden-full-transcript-ellipses'>...</span></p><a href='#' class='hidden-full-transcript-link'><i class='icon-chevron-down'></i> <span class='link-show-full-text'>Show Full Text</span><i class='icon-chevron-up'></i> <span class='link-show-less-text'>Show Less Text</span></a>

IN THIS ROOM WHO FACE<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> WHEN I FACE. WHO FOUGHT THE FEAR BY HIS GRACE AND MERCY, AND SURVIVED. DEMOCRATS, WE MUST FIGHT THE REPUBLICAN NOMINEES OF FEAR. AND UNITE BEHIND HILLARY CLINTON, THE CANDIDATE WHO
FIGHTS FOR US.
[APPLAUSE] I CAME HERE FROM HOUSTON. A CITY WITH A GREAT NEW MAYOR
AND A PLACE WHERE PEOPLE OF ALL
RACES AND THE SEXUAL ORIENTATION AND RELIGION ARE RESPECTED. WE HAVE A STRONG LEGACY. BARBARA JORDAN. WHO ADDRESSED THE 1976 DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION. HER PURSUIT OF JUSTICE AND EQUALITY IS OUR CALL TODAY. BARBARA JORDAN ONCE SAID,
THROUGH THE PROCESS OF AMENDMENT, INTERPRETATION AND COURT DECISION, I HAVE FINALLY BEEN INCLUDED IN "WE, THE PEOPLE." DEMOCRATS, WE ARE THE "WE THE PEOPLE" PARTY.
[APPLAUSE] LAST NIGHT WE REACHED A MILESTONE IN HISTORY. WE NOMINATED THE FIRST WOMAN TO
BE THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, HILLARY
CLINTON. A WOMAN OF UNCOMMON STRENGTH. A CHANGE MAKER, A SURVIVOR. I AM WOMAN, HEAR ME ROAR.
[APPLAUSE] BUT ON THE OTHER HAND, WE HAVE
THE REPUBLICAN NOMINEE, THE MAN
OF THE FEAR. AND CLEVELAND, THE CONVENTION OF
FEAR. BUT WE CANNOT CHOOSE FEAR. WE CANNOT ELECT A PRESIDENT WHO
PROVIDES NO HOPE TO THE LAID-OFF UNION WORKER, NO HOPE FOR THE
MOTHER OF FIVE, AND NO HOPE FOR THE RESEARCHER WHO MIGHT FIND A
CURE FOR CANCER. WE CANNOT ELECT A LEADER WHO IS WILLFULLY IGNORANT TO THE OUTCRY
OF YOUNG PEOPLE WHO WANT REAL
CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM AND RESPONSIBLE GUN SAFETY
LEGISLATION NOW. NOT ANOTHER NEW TOWN, CHARLESTON, ORLANDO, BATON ROUGE, OR DALLAS. THE REPUBLICANS NOMINEE OF FEAR
IS NOT FOR OUR AMERICA. DEMOCRATS, WHAT OUR MISSION IS TODAY, WE MUST BE DETERMINED IN OUR FIGHT, DEMANDING OF EACH OTHER, DISCERNING OF THE FACTS,
AND THE DEMONSTRATIVE OF OUR
MOVEMENT. THE UNIVERSE IS SOMETIMES DARK,
BUT THERE ARE BRIGHT STARS THAT
LIGHT OUR WAY. AND THEY WILL GUIDE US TO A SAFER, MORE PROSPEROUS AND MORE
EQUITABLE AMERICA.
THE WINDS OF CHANGE ARE AT OUR BACKS. CLINTON AND KAINE, AND WE MUST
MARCH ON. MARCH ON, MARCH ON, AND TOGETHER
WE CAN ELECT HILLARY CLINTON.

AND SEE THOSE STARS. STAND UP AND SEE THE LIGHT.

WE FACE AS A NATION. BOTH AS COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF,<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> AND AS A MOTHER AND GRANDMOTHER WHO UNDERSTANDS THE CHALLENGES OF THE FAMILY. WE AS A NATION ARE UNDERSTANDABLY ANXIOUS ABOUT THE

LIKE TO MAKE DECISIONS IN THE WHITE HOUSE SITUATION ROOM. I TRUST HILLARY CLINTON TO MAKE US SAFE. AND I ALSO LOOK FORWARD TO THE DAY, AND I CAN SEE IT FROM HERE,
WHEN WE HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO KNOWS FIRSTHAND HOW WOMEN'S ECONOMIC SECURITY IS TIED TO THE ISSUES LIKE ACCESS TO WOMEN'S HEALTH CARE, EQUAL PAY FOR THE SAME WORK, AND LONG-TERM CARE
FOR OUR DISABLED CHILDREN AND
AGING PARENTS. WE HAVE A MOTTO IN CONGRESS, WHEN WOMEN SUCCEED, AMERICA SUCCEEDS. RIGHT? BUT THAT MOTTO DOESN'T SEEM TO MATTER TO DONALD TRUMP AND MIKE
PENCE. WE ALL KNOW HOW DONALD TRUMP TALKS ABOUT WOMEN. HE HAS SUGGESTED THAT WORKING
MOTHERS AREN'T GIVING 100% AT THEIR JOBS. HE HAS CALLED BREAST-FEEDING DISGUSTING. HE THINKS THAT EQUAL PAY FOR WOMEN TAKES AWAY FROM
"CAPITALISM." NOW HE HAS A RUNNING MATE WHO THINKS WOMEN BELONG IN THE HOME,
NOT RUNNING COMPANIES, NOT
SERVING IN THE MILITARY, AND
CERTAINLY NOT RUNNING THE COUNTRY.
[BOOS] LOOK, I'M INCREDIBLY FORTUNATE TO SERVE MY BELOVED CONSTITUENTS

CONGRESS. BUT I'M ALSO THE PROUD MOTHER OF 2 INCREDIBLE DAUGHTERS. I AM GRANDMA TO MY BEAUTIFUL GRANDDAUGHTER AVERY. AND I AM THE PRIMARY CAREGIVER FOR MY MOM. CAREGIVING IS PART OF WHY YOU. THAT IS PART OF WHO I AM. BUT IT'S FINANCIALLY DRAINING. HILLARY CLINTON UNDERSTANDS WE
NEED TO SUPPORT THE MILLIONS OF FAMILIES WHO ARE CARING FOR
THEIR AGING OR DISABLED FAMILY
MEMBERS.
[APPLAUSE] SHE WILL FIGHT FOR AN AMERICA
WHERE EVERY WOMAN HAS THE
ECONOMIC SECURITY SHE NEEDS TO
LIVE THE LIFE THAT SHE WANTS AND DESERVES. I BELIEVE HER. WE BELIEVE HER. HILLARY CLINTON STANDS WITH US,

GROWING BY 1000 EVERY MONTH IN
YOUR NATION'S CAPITAL. WE ARE SO PROUD OF OUR CITY,

[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WE ARE HOME TO OUR MOST POWERFUL INSTITUTIONS, YET WE HAVE BEEN
DENIED OUR POWER AS AMERICAN CITIZENS. THE POWER WE SEEK IS ORDINARY, NOT LOFTY. IT IS THE DEMOCRATIC POWER OF EQUAL CITIZENSHIP.
[APPLAUSE] IT IS THE POWER OF LAWFUL
CONTROL OVER $4 BILLION IN
LOCALLY RAISED FUNDS. 30 STATES RELY MORE ON FEDERAL FUNDS TO REPLACE THEIR ANNUAL
BUDGET THAN D.C. DOES. IT IS THE POWER OF LOCAL CONTROL OVER PURELY LOCAL LAWS, LIKE OUR
GUN SAFETY LAWS.
[APPLAUSE] THAT REPUBLICANS TRY TO
ELIMINATE EVERY SINGLE YEAR. AND YES, IT IS ALSO THE DEMOCRATIC POWER THAT GAVE BIRTH
TO THE NATION ITSELF, THE QUID
PRO QUO POWER OF THE VOTE IN THE
HOUSE AND SENATE IN RETURN FOR
THE TAXES WE PAY TO SUPPORT THE
UNITED STATES. FOR D.C. RESIDENCE NOT ONLY PAY TAXES FOR OUR REPRESENTATION, WE PAY THE HIGHEST FEDERAL TAXES PER CAPITA IN THE UNITED STATES,
WITH NO VOTE IN THE HOUSE AND S ENATE TO SHOW FOR THOSE TAXES. THE LACK OF VOTING RIGHTS, THE
NATION'S FOUNDERS DECLARED THEIR INDEPENDENCE AND DARED THEIR

OF COLUMBIA. OUR NOMINEE HILLARY CLINTON SAYS AS PRESIDENT, I WILL BE A VOCAL CHAMPION FOR D.C. STATEHOOD. NEVER BEFORE HAS A PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE TAKEN OFFICE WITH SO SOLID A PROMISE FOR FULL AND
EQUAL CITIZENSHIP FOR D.C. RESIDENCE. AND LISTEN UP, AMERICA. A NOMINEE WHO WILL STAND UP FOR D.C. WILL STAND UP FOR YOU, TOO. HILLARY FOR PRESIDENT, STATEHOOD FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA.

<strong>Adam B. Schiff</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> REP. SCHIFF: THANK YOU. AS THE RANKING DEMOCRAT ON THE
HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE, I
AM AWARE OF THE GRAVE THREATS WE
FACE. FROM THE MURDEROUS BRUTALITY<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> OF
ISIS AND AL QAEDA, TO MY RUNS SPONSORSHIP OF TERROR, FROM THE
BELLIGERENCE OF THE VLADIMIR PUTIN TO THE MAD MEN IN PYONGYANG, THIS NOVEMBER
AMERICA'S DECISION IS ABOUT MORE THAN WHO CONFRONTS THESE THREATS, IT'S ALSO ABOUT HOW. WILL WE CONTINUE TO BE A BEGIN FOR THE FREEDOM LOVING PEOPLES AROUND THE WORLD? OR WILL WE HUNKERED DOWN,
SHELTER IN PLACE, OR WORSE, SOW DIVISION AND DISCORD. WILL WE PICKED A MAN WITH NO
VISION WHO COWERS BEHIND ANGRY
RHETORIC, OR WILL WE PICKED A WOMAN OF COURAGE, CONVICTION,
AND PASSION? IN SHORT, THE STAKES COULD NOT
BE HIGHER. WHEN THE RIGHT OF EXPRESSION RELIGION AND ASSOCIATION ARE UNDER ASSAULT AROUND THE GLOBE, WHEN THE WORLD NEEDS A LEADER
THAT CAN OFFER BLOOD, TEARS,
TOIL AND SWEAT, TRUMP OFFERS
ONLY BLUSTER, TIRADE, TEDIUM,
AND THREAT. WITH MALICE TOWARDS ALL THE
CHARITY FOR NONE, TRUMP WOULD
SEPARATE US FROM THE WORLD AND DIVIDE US HERE AT HOME. IN TRUMP'S WORLD, NATO IS A RELIC, PUTIN AND ALLY, CINNAMON AND EXAMPLE, AND TORTURE OUR INSTRUMENT. IS NOT LEADERSHIP, THIS IS
CALAMITY.
[APPLAUSE] IT IS NOT SPEAKING HARD TRUTHS OR SHUTTING POLITICAL CORRECTNESS, BUT INSTEAD FAILING
TO SEE AMERICA'S GREATNESS. IT'S ESSENTIAL GOODNESS, IT'S UNENDING PROMISE. TRUMP WHAT HAVE US THROW THE
DICE WITH AMERICA'S FUTURE. WE WILL NOT DO IT.
[APPLAUSE] BUT THANK GOD AMERICA HAS A CHOICE. RATHER THAN A MAN OF ENDLESS EGO AND OBSESSION, WE CAN CHOOSE A WOMAN OF PURPOSE AND DETERMINATION. INSTEAD OF A MAN THAT SEES
LITTLE BUT DANGER AND MURDER IN
THE FACE OF IMMIGRANTS, WE CAN CHOOSE A WOMAN WHO UNDERSTANDS
HOW IMMIGRANTS HAVE STRENGTHENED
THIS NATION OF IMMIGRANTS.
[APPLAUSE] INSTEAD OF A MAN WHO WOULD
GAMBLE ON THE GREATNESS OF AMERICA, WE CAN CHOOSE A WOMAN
WITH A BRILLIANT MIND, A RESOLUTE HEART, A STEADY HAND,
AND A PASSION FOR THE BETTERMENT
OF HUMANKIND. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THIS FALSE
THE CHOICE FOR COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF IS CLEAR. HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON.

<p class='short_transcript'> REP. WATERS: HELLO DEMOCRATS. I AM MAXINE WATERS AND I AM A PROUD DEMOCRAT FROM THE
PROGRESSIVE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THE PRIMARY<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> SEASON HAS ENDED, AND WE HAVE SO MUCH TO BE PROUD
OF. AS A MEMBER OF THE PLATFORM
COMMITTEE, I HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH GIVING BERNIE SANDERS CREDIT FOR CONTRIBUTING TO OUR
HISTORIC PROGRESSIVE PLATFORM.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND I AM THRILLED TO A KNOWLEDGE SECRETARY HILLARY CLINTON'S WORK
TO UNITE AND STRENGTHEN OUR
DEMOCRATIC PARTY.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] SO TOMORROW NIGHT, HILLARY CLINTON WILL ACCEPT THE PARTY NOMINATION.
AND WE MUST LEAVE THIS CONVENTION ENERGIZED, UNITED, AND COMMITTED TO WINNING IN
NOVEMBER.
[APPLAUSE] AMERICA, WE HAVE A WINNER IN WAITING. THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I AM SO PROUD TO SUPPORT A WOMAN WHO HAS THE SKILLS TO MEET WITH WORLD LEADERS, CAME AND QUEENS,
AND WHO COMMANDS RESPECT FROM OUR FRIENDS AND OUR FOES ALIKE.
I AM ELATED TO HAVE A CANDIDATE
WHO REALLY UNDERSTANDS DIPLOMACY, GLOBAL SECURITY, AND
THE IMPORTANCE OF CLIMATE
PROTECTION. I AM SO THANKFUL WE HAVE HILLARY CLINTON, WHOSE LIFE OF PUBLIC
SERVICE IS NOT MYTHICAL, BUT REAL AND PROFOUND. HILLARY CLINTON WILL HAVE THE TRUST OF OUR DISABLED AMERICANS. SHE WILL NEVER MOCK OR DISRESPECT THEM. SHE WILL WORK TO IMPROVE THEIR
LIVES. AND SHE WILL NOT ALLOW OUR
VETERANS TO BE PATRONIZED OR FORGOTTEN. I KNOW HILLARY CLINTON WILL
CREATE A PLACE AT THE TABLE FOR
ALL. AFRICAN-AMERICANS, LATINOS,
AGENTS, THE LGBT COMMUNITY, NATIVE AMERICANS, JEWS, MUSLIMS, BAPTISTS, PENTECOSTALS -- EVERYONE WILL BE WELCOMED IN
HILLARY CLINTON'S WHITE HOUSE. NOW YOU KNOW THE NRA HAS INTIMIDATED A LOT OF MEMBERS OF
CONGRESS. BUT HILLARY CLINTON IS NOT
INTIMIDATED BY THE NRA.
GUN VIOLENCE MUST STOP IN THIS
COUNTRY. SHE WILL NOT ROLL WITH FEAR AND
PREDICTIONS OF FAILURE. AND SHE WILL WORK TO SUPPORT OUR BELIEFS, SHE WILL ALSO SUPPORT
FAIR AND JUST POLICE POLICY. THE LOST LIVES OF UNARMED
CITIZENS MUST STOP. BLACK LIVES MATTER.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] OH YES, WOMEN OF AMERICA, WOMEN
OF THE WORLD, WE ARE GOING TO BE TREATED WITH DIGNITY AND
RESPECT. WE WILL NOT BE JUDGED BY OUR APPEARANCE OR OUR SIZE OR OUR ACCENT. WE WILL NOT BE DENIED FREEDOM OF
CHOICE. WE WILL DEMONSTRATE OUR TALENTS
AND WE WILL PROSPER. HILLARY'S EXPERIENCE AS THE FIRST LADY, AS THE U.S. SENATOR, AS THE BEST SECRETARY OF STATE
WE EVER HAD, UNIQUELY QUALIFIES HER TO BE THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF
THE UNITED STATES. THANK YOU.

<strong>Ilyse Hogue</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> I AM A FOURTH GENERATION TEXAN. TEXAS WOMEN ARE TOUGH. WE APPROACH CHALLENGES WITH
CLEAR EYES AND FULL HEARTS. TO SUCCEED IN LIFE, ALL WE NEED
ARE<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> THE TOOLS, THE TRUST, AND THE CHANCE TO CHART OUR OWN
PATH. I WAS FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO HAVE THESE THINGS WHEN I FOUND OUT I
WAS PREGNANT YEARS AGO.
I WANTED A FAMILY, BUT IT WAS
THE WRONG TIME. I MADE THE DECISION THAT WAS
BEST FOR ME. TO HAVE AN ABORTION AND GET PASSIONATE CARE IN A CLINIC IN MY OWN COMMUNITY. NOW YEARS LATER MY HUSBAND AND I ARE PARENTS TO TWO INCREDIBLE CHILDREN. MY STORY IS NOT UNIQUE. ABOUT ONE IN THREE AMERICAN
WOMEN HAVE ABORTIONS BY THE AGE OF 45 AND THE MAJORITY ARE
MOTHERS JUST TRYING TO TAKE CARE
OF THE FAMILIES THEY ALREADY
HAVE. YOU SEE, IT'S NOT AS SIMPLE AS THAT GIRLS GET ABORTIONS AND GO GIRLS HAVE FAMILIES.
WE ARE THE SAME WOMEN AT
DIFFERENT TIMES IN OUR LIVES.
-- IT'S NOT AS SIMPLE AS BAD GIRLS GET ABORTIONS AND GOOD GIRLS HAVE FAMILIES.
IF WE WANT FAMILIES TO SUCCEED,
WE START BY EMPOWERING WOMEN.
GIVE US ACCURATE INFORMATION AND
ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE. KEEP POLITICIANS OUT OF OUR BUSINESS WHEN WE ARE NOT READY TO PARENT, AND SUPPORT US WHEN
WE ARE. THAT IS WHAT GIVES OUR FAMILIES
THE BEST CHANCE TO GET AHEAD AND STAY AHEAD. AND THAT IS WHAT HILLARY CLINTON
HAS SPENT DECADES FIGHTING FOR. DONALD TRUMP IS DIFFERENT. HE SAID WOMEN WHO HAVE ABORTIONS
LIKE ME SHOULD BE PUNISHED.
HE CALLS WOMEN PIGS AND SAYS
BREAST-FEEDING IS DISGUSTING. SOME PEOPLE THINK HE DOESN'T
REALLY MEAN ANY OF THAT. BUT LOOK AT WHO HE PICKS FOR VP. MIKE PENCE HAS LED THE CHARGE TO DEFUND PLANNED PARENTHOOD, PUSH
TO LET HOSPITALS TURN A WOMAN
AWAY IF SHE NEEDS AN ABORTION TO SAVE HER LIFE, AND SIGNED A BILL
WITH SOME OF THE MOST OUTRAGEOUS
ABORTION RESTRICTIONS IN THE
COUNTRY. HE EVEN SAID HE CAN'T WAIT TO SEND ROVERS IS WAIT INTO THE -- SEND ROE V. WADE INTO THE ASH
HEAP OF HISTORY. DONALD TRUMP AND MIKE PENCE HAVE FORMED THE "MAKE MISOGYNY GREAT AGAIN" TICKET. AND THE PEOPLE WHO SO LOUDLY OPPOSED ABORTION RIGHTS, LET ME
LET YOU INTO THEIR DIRTY LITTLE
SECRET. THEY ARE NOT ONLY AGAINST ABORTION. MANY OF THESE PEOPLE ARE ALSO
FIGHTING TO RESTRICT ACCESS TO CONTRACEPTION AND BLOCK COMMONSENSE POLICIES TO SUPPORT WORKING MOMS. IT'S NOT ABORTION THAT BOTHERS THEM, IT'S EMPOWERING WOMEN TO
LIVE OUR OWN LIVES. THAT IS RIGHT. AND WHEN WE HAVE POWER OVER OUR DESTINY, WE NOT ONLY STRENGTHEN
OUR FAMILIES, WE HONBOR ARE MOST CHERISHED TRADITIONS OF LIBERTY
AND EQUALITY. THESE AREN'T JUST WOMEN'S ISSUES, THESE ARE THE VERY
FOUNDATION OF OUR FREEDOM. WE NEED A PRESIDENT WHO HAS THE
EXPERIENCE, THE WISDOM, AND THE
GREAT TO STAND UP AGAINST THE
BULLIES. WE NEED A PRESIDENT WHO KNOWS
THAT WOMEN'S RIGHTS ARE HUMAN
RIGHTS. WE NEED A PRESIDENT WHO WILL
KEEP EXPANDING THE FRONTIERS OF
FREEDOM FOR ALL AMERICANS. WE DID HILLARY CLINTON.

<strong>Andrew Gillum</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> MAYOR GILLUM: HELLO MY FELLOW
DEMOCRATS. AND HELLO MY FELLOW FOR RADIANS.
-- FELLOW FLORIDIANS.
IN CASE YOU NEED A REMINDER,
FLORIDA IS IN THE HOUSE.
[CHEERS<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> AND APPLAUSE] AS I PREPARE FOR TONIGHT, I
THOUGHT BACK ON THE PAST THAT
LED ME TO THIS MOMENT. BORN THE FIFTH OF SEVEN KIDS, IN MIAMI-DADE FLORIDA TO MY DADDY, CHARLES, A CONSTRUCTION WORKER,
AND MY MOTHER FRANCES, A SCHOOL
BUS DRIVER. MY PARENTS WORKED THEIR ENTIRE LIVES TO PROVIDE FOR ME AND FOR MY SIBLINGS. GREATER OPPORTUNITY THAT THEY HAD EVER BEEN AFFORDED. TRADING THE POSSIBILITY FOR ME
TO BE THE FIRST OF MY FAMILY TO
GO TO COLLEGE AND GRADUATE FROM
FLORIDA A&M UNIVERSITY.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THEY DARED US TO FLY HIGHER THAN THEY COULD EVER SEE. AND THEY ALWAYS PROVIDED US THE OPPORTUNITY AND A PATH TO PAY IT FORWARD. I CAN STILL HEAR MY GRANDMOTHER'S VOICE TELLING ME, BOY, GO TO SCHOOL, MIND YOUR TEACHERS, GET YOUR LESSONS, AND
ONE DAY BRING THAT EDUCATION
HOME. SHE SAYS, BRING IT HOME FOR YOUR
BABY SISTER AND LITTLE BROTHER
WHO MAY NOT KNOW WHAT EDUCATION
IS. SHE SAYS BRING IT HOME FOR THAT
LITTLE BOY DOWN THE STREET THAT
YOU PLAY WITH. GOD KNOWS WHERE HE WILL END UP. IT WAS A REMINDER THAT IF WE
WERE GOING TO GET ANYWHERE, WE
WOULD GET THERE TOGETHER. MY FRIENDS, THIS IS THE STORY OF
OUR PARTY. IT'S ALSO WHAT DRIVES OUR
NOMINEE. HILLARY CLINTON HAS SHOWN US HER HEART, HER STRENGTH, HER PASSION
FOR THIS COUNTRY'S FUTURE. A FUTURE THAT MEANS MORE TO ME NOW THAN IT EVER DID BEFORE. BECAUSE IN ADDITION TO BEING THE
MAYOR OF TALLAHASSEE FLORIDA, THE CAPITAL CITY OF OUR NATION'S THIRD-LARGEST STATE, I AM ALSO A
FATHER. AND ALONG WITH MY WIFE, WE ARE RAISING TWO-YEAR-OLD TWINS
JOHNSON AND CAROLINE. WHEN I HEADED TO THE VOTING BOOTH, I WANT YOU TO KNOW THEY ARE COMING WITH ME. BECAUSE I WANT THEM TO KNOW THAT I AM NOT JUST PASSING A VOTE FOR
HILLARY CLINTON AND FELLOW DEMOCRATS.
I AM CASTING A VOTE FOR THEM. ENSURING THE KIND OF FUTURE THEY DESERVE REQUIRES LEADERSHIP THAT
WILL UNIFY AND INSPIRE US. THAT CAN BUILD ON THIS COUNTRY'S BEST INSTINCT FOR CONCLUSION AND OPTIMISM. THE WORLD CAN SEEM SCARY ENOUGH
WITHOUT SO-CALLED LEADERS
LEADING WITH FEAR FOR POLITICAL GAIN. THAT'S RIGHT. EVERY DAY IN THIS COUNTRY BLACK PARENTS SEND THEIR SONS OUT OF A
DEEP SENSE OF ANXIETY, HOPING
THEY WILL RETURN HOME TO THEM
SAFELY. EVERY DAY POLICE OFFICERS KISS THEIR LOVED ONES HEADING TO WORK
AND HAVE THAT FEAR IN THEIR
HEARTS. IN THESE TIMES OF ANGER AND FEAR, WE CANNOT AFFORD TO
RETREAT TO OUR RESPECTIVE CORNERS. WE CAN'T LET THIS ANIMOSITY GROW AND GET STRONGER. THAT'S RIGHT. AND THE TRUTH IS, WE HAVE SEEN
EXAMPLES OF COMMUNITIES AND LAW
ENFORCEMENT COMING TOGETHER IN
CRISIS, TO GRIEVE TOGETHER AND
HELP EACH OTHER HEAL. THAT IS EXACTLY HOW IT IS
SUPPOSED TO WORK. AND IT'S ON ALL OF US TO ENSURE
THAT IN OUR COMMUNITIES, THAT
BECOMES THE REALITY. BECAUSE IN THE END, WE ALL WANT
THE SAME THING FOR OUR FAMILIES. OUR FATES ARE INDEX WOULD
COMPLETE TIGHT TOGETHER.
-- OUR FATES ARE INEXPLICABLY
TIED TOGETHER. WE CAN RENEW TRUST IN EACH OTHER
ONCE AGAIN. I BELIEVE WITH EVERY FIBER OF MY
BEGIN THAT HILLARY CLINTON IS
THE LEADER THAT WE NEED.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] SO ON INAUGURATION DAY I LOOK FORWARD TO HOLDING MY BABY'S
TIGHTLY. I LOOK FORWARD TO WATCHING
HISTORY UNFOLD BEFORE THEIR EYES
AND BEFORE MINE. AND ALONG WITH YOU SHOUTING
TOWARD THAT EXCHANGE IN
WASHINGTON DC AND SAYING, CONGRATULATIONS, MADAM
PRESIDENT.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THANK YOU AND GOD BLESS.

TRAILBLAZERS IN THEIR OWN RIGHT. AND WE ARE ALL PROUD TO SUPPORT HILLARY CLINTON FOR PRESIDENT OF

[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] IT WASN'T TOO LONG AGO THAT IF
YOU SAW AN ASIAN PACIFIC AMERICAN WALKING IN THE U.S. CAPITOL, YOU HAD TO STOP TO DO A
DOUBLE TAKE. BUT HOW THINGS HAVE CHANGED. WE NOW HAVE A RECORD NUMBER OF
THE API MEMBERS OF CONGRESS. MOST IMPORTANTLY, WE ARE ORGANIZING AND MAKING OUR VOICES
HEARD. WE HAVE GONE FROM BEING MARGINALIZED TO BECOMING THE
MARGIN OF VICTORY IN KEY SWING STATES AND DISTRICTS ALL ACROSS OUR NATION. AMERICA NEEDS A PRESIDENT WHO
WILL FIGHT FOR US. SOMEWHAT WHO REJECTS THE HATEFUL RHETORIC TOO OFTEN USED TO DIVIDE US AND BELIEVES THAT AMERICA'S DIVERSITY IS OUR
GREATEST STRENGTH. THAT IS WHY WE STOPPED TO ELECT HILLARY CLINTON AS OUR NEXT
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. WHEN IT COMES TO THE ISSUES MOST
IMPORTANT TO US, HILLARY CLINTON
GETS IT. ON IMMIGRATION REFORM, SHE GETS
IT. SO MANY FAMILIES HAVE BEEN KEPT
APART FOR DECADES BY AN INCREDIBLY LONG FAMILY VISA BACKLOG. HILLARY WILL FIGHT TO CLEAR THAT
BACKLOG SO MANY MILLIONS OF
AMERICAN FAMILIES CAN FINALLY BE REUNITED WITH THEIR LOVED ONES. WE ARE WITH HILLARY BECAUSE SHE IS COMMITTED TO COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM.
[APPLAUSE] ON EDUCATION, SHE GETS IT. MANY OF OUR PARENTS AND GRANDPARENTS SACRIFICED TO COME
TO THE U.S. BECAUSE THEY WANTED
THEIR CHILDREN TO GET A BETTER
EDUCATION AND LIVE THE AMERICAN
DREAM. WE ARE WITH HILLARY BECAUSE SHE
WILL MAKE DEBT-FREE COLORS
AVAILABLE FOR ALL AMERICANS.
ON VOTING RIGHTS, SHE GETS IT. TODAY ALMOST 70% OF AAPI RESULTS
ARE FOREIGN-BORN. ACCESS TO BALANCE IS CRITICAL. WE ARE WITH HILLARY BECAUSE SHE
WILL WORK WITH CONGRESS TO
RESTORE THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT
AND ENSURE FAIR ACCESS TO THE BALLOT BOX.
[APPLAUSE] ON MAKING SURE WE HAVE A DIVERSE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, SHE GETS IT. WE ARE WITH HILLARY BECAUSE SHE WILL APPOINT AN ADMINISTRATION THAT LOOKS LIKE AMERICA.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND ON SAFEGUARDING OUR CIVIL
LIBERTIES, SHE GETS IT. I AM SO PROUD TO HAVE CONGRESSWOMAN DORIS MATSUI AND
CONGRESSMAN MIKE HONDA AS
MEMBERS OF OUR CONGRESS.
-- OF OUR CAUCUS. DURING WORLD WAR II, BOTH DORIS AND MIKE WERE IMPRISONED IN INTERNMENT CAMP FOR NO OTHER
REASON THAN THEIR ETHNICITY. DONALD TRUMP DOESN'T SEEM TO
HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THIS PART OF
OUR HISTORY.
WHEN HILLARY CLINTON, WE KNOW
THE CIVIL AND CONSTITUTIONAL
RIGHTS OF ALL AMERICANS WILL BE PROTECTED.
[APPLAUSE] TONIGHT WE ARE ALSO READING FOR
MARK TAKAI FROM HAWAII, WHO PASSED AWAY LAST WEEK AT THE AGE OF 49 AFTER A HARD-FOUGHT BATTLE WITH PANCREATIC CANCER. MARK TRULY HAD THE ALOHA SPIRIT AND WAS DEEPLY COMMITTED TO ADVANCING THE PRIORITIES OF THE PEOPLE OF HAWAII AND OUR
VETERANS. I WILL NEVER FORGET THE TEARS IN
HIS EYES WHEN HE LEARNED ABOUT
THE CANCER MOONSHOT INITIATIVE.
IT SAVED HIM AND MILLIONS OF
AMERICANS HOPE THAT THEY WILL
FINALLY FIND IT OR FRANCE OR -- FINALLY FIND A CURE FOR CANCER.
WE HAVE TO KEEP HOPING AND
FIGHTING. HILLARY CLINTON IS THE BEST
CHOICE FOR ALL AMERICANS TO MOVE
OUR COUNTRY FORWARD.
OUR CAUCUS MEMBERS REFLECT THE
DIVERSITY OF AMERICA, AND THAT
IS WHY WE ARE PROUD TO STAND WITH HER.

<strong>Brooks Bell</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> HELLO DEMOCRATS. I AM A TECHNOLOGY ENTREPRENEUR
WERE FROM RALEIGH, NORTH
CAROLINA. WHEN I WAS 23 YEARS OLD, I
STARTED MY OWN COMPANY. IT WASN'T EASY.<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> SIX MONTHS LATER, I HAD A STROKE. I HAD TO RELEARN TO READ, WRITE, AND TALK. I WAS LUCKY. I RECOVERED, AND SO
DID MY FLEDGLING COMPANY. BUT THAT WAS NOT MY ONLY
STRUGGLE. IN FACT, IT WAS ONE OF MY MANY UPS AND DOWNS, FAMILIAR TO ANY
SMALL BUSINESS WITH BIG DREAMS.
I HAVE GAINED AND LOST BIG CLIENTS.
I HAVE HAD TO LET WONDERFUL EMPLOYEES GO. IT'S GIVEN ME THE START THAT I
KNOW MANY ENTREPRENEURS SHARE. I BELIEVE IN HILLARY BECAUSE I
KNOW SHE ALSO CARRIES BATTLE SCARS. HER RELENTLESS DEDICATION TO SERVE AMERICA OVER THE PAST 30 YEARS HAS BEEN MARKED BY HARD CHOICES, WHICH MAKES THIS HISTORIC ACHIEVEMENT ALL THE MORE IMPRESSIVE.
[APPLAUSE] HER TENACITY, HER TOUGHNESS,
HERB SEASONED JUDGMENT IS
EXACTLY WHAT WE NEED IN A
PRESIDENT. WE NEED SOMEBODY READY FOR THE
HARDEST JOB ON EARTH, DAY ONE. AND THAT SOMEONE IS HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON.
[APPLAUSE] TODAY MY COMPANY EMPLOYS OVER 40
PEOPLE. WE PARTNER WITH SOME OF THE
LARGEST ORGANIZATIONS IN AMERICA
TO HELP MAKE THE INTERNET EASIER
TO USE. WE ARE GROWING QUICKLY. MY COMPANY IS STRONG, AS IS MY HEALTH, THANKS IN PART TO
ONGOING INVESTMENT IN EDUCATION, HEALTH CARE, AND INNOVATION. LIKE THEY SAY, THANKS OBAMA.
[APPLAUSE] HOWEVER, I AM WORRIED, TERRIFIED ABOUT WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN IF WE ELECT TRUMP. I AM NOT JUST SCARED FOR MY BUSINESS, BUT FOR ALL THE OTHER
YOUNG ENTREPRENEURS LIKE ME. WE HAVE ALREADY SEEN THE PREVIEW IN MY OWN STATE OF NORTH CAROLINA. EARLIER THIS YEAR, OUR
LEGISLATURE PASSED WHAT IS KNOWN
AS THE BATHROOM BILL.
[BOOS] WHICH CAUSED THE NEW YORK TIMES TO DESCRIBE NORTH CAROLINA AS "A TINIER -- A PIONEER IN BIGOTRY."
BESIDES BEING DEEPLY
EMBARRASSING AND MORALLY WRONG,
IT HAD AN IMMEDIATE AND DRAMATIC AFFECT ON OUR STATE ON OUR STATE ECONOMY.
I WATCHED A LARGE COMPANY CANCEL THEIR EXPANSION, TAKING 400 GOOD JOBS WITH THEM.
TWO INFLUENTIAL TECHNOLOGY
INVESTORS IMMEDIATELY BANNED
INVESTMENT IN OUR STATE. THE NBA JUST PULLED THE ALL-STAR GAME OUT OF TOWN:.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
BROOKS: THE TOTAL ECONOMIC COSTS
IS ALREADY $190 MILLION AND
COUNTING.
WHAT DOES THIS HAVE TO DO WITH
TRUMP? FOR STARTERS, TRUMP SELECTED
MIKE PENCE AS HIS RUNNING MATE.
THE SAME MIKE PENCE WHO SIGNED A
DISCRIMINATORY BILL INTO INDIANA LAW WITH SIMILAR DISASTROUS CONSEQUENCES. IT'S NO SURPRISE THAT ECONOMISTS
HAVE LISTED A TRUMP PRESIDENCY AS ONE OF THE TOP 10 RISKS TO THE WORLD ECONOMY.
FRIENDS, I'M HERE TONIGHT
BECAUSE THE STORY OF MY START-UP IS THE STORY OF AMERICA, BECAUSE HOW WE WRITE OUR NEXT CHAPTER IS
UP TO US. PLEASE JOIN ME IN STANDING UP
FOR AN INCLUSIVE COUNTRY WITH
INNOVATION AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP
FUELING OUR ECONOMIC PROSPERITY! LET'S PUT HILLARY CLINTON WHERE
WE NEED HER THE MOST, AS
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA! THANK YOU!

<strong>Bill de Blasio Jr.</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> MAYOR DE BLASIO: THANK YOU.
THANK YOU, DEMOCRATS! AS A NEW YORKER, I AM QUITE FAMILIAR WITH BOTH PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEES. BUT DESPITE SHARING A HOME STATE,<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> THESE TWO PEOPLE ARE WORLDS APART. I WAS HONORED TO MANAGE HILLARY CLINTON'S FIRST CAMPAIGN FOR THE U.S. SENATE AND HERE'S THE HILLARY I KNOW.
WHEN SHE GRADUATED FROM LAW SCHOOL, SHE COULD HAVE BEGUN A
LUCRATIVE CAREER AS A
PRESTIGIOUS LAW FIRM OF HER
CHOICE. INSTEAD, HER HEART LED HER TO TAKE A NOBLE JOB AT MODEST PAY AT THE CHILDREN'S DEFENSE FUND ADVOCATING FOR POOR FAMILIES AND CHILDREN WHO NEEDED A CHAMPION.
THAT IS WHO SHE IS.
WHAT DID DONALD TRUMP DO?
HE WAS BORN RICH. HE MADE A CAREER OUT OF RIPPING
PEOPLE OFF, RACKING UP BILLIONS IN DEBT AND BANKRUPTING HIS COMPANIES.
INSTEAD OF PUBLIC SERVICE OR
PHILANTHROPY, HE BECAME ONE OF
THE LEAST GENEROUS BILLIONAIRES
OUR COUNTRY HAS EVER SEEN.
WHEN HILLARY CLINTON WAS FIRST
LADY OF THE UNITED STATES, SHE MADE IT HER PERSONAL MISSION TO
TAKE ON THE INSURANCE GIANTS TO
GET HEALTHCARE FOR EVERY AMERICAN. NOW, DESPITE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS
SPENT ATTACKING HER, SHE NEVER
GAVE UP AND SHE HELPED DELIVER
THE CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM AGAINST ALL THE ODDS.
[APPLAUSE] MAYOR DE BLASIO: WHO DID DONALD TAKE ON?
THE SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS HE
CONTRACTED WITH ON HIS REAL ESTATE PROJECTS. TOO MANY TIMES, DONALD SIMPLY STIFFED THEM. NOW, WE KNOW TRUMP IS THE GREAT PRETENDER, BUT HOW CAN HE
PRETEND TO BE FOR AMERICAN
WORKERS WHEN HE DIDN'T EVEN PAY
HIS OWN WORKERS WHAT HE OWED THEM.
WHEN HILLARY CLINTON WAS IN THE
SENATE, SHE HELPED SECURE $20 BILLION FOR OUR RECOVERY AFTER 9/11, PROTECTING OUR HERO FIRST RESPONDERS WHO SACRIFICED SO MUCH.
WHO DID DONALD PROTECT? CERTAINLY NOT THE STUDENTS AT TRUMP UNIVERSITY, A PLACE HIS
OWN EMPLOYEES CALLED A SCAM,
WHERE VULNERABLE AMERICANS WERE
PUSHED TO SPEND MORE AND MORE
MONEY ON WORTHLESS CLASSES. THE ONLY PERSON DONALD TOOK CARE OF WAS HIMSELF.
AS SECRETARY OF STATE, HILLARY
FOUGHT FOR THE DIGNITY OF WOMEN AND GIRLS, PASSIONATELY FIGHTING THE SCOURGE OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING AND THE HORROR OF CHILD MARRIAGE
IN SAUDI ARABIA.
WHAT DID DONALD DO? HE'S CALLED WOMEN DOGS AND FAT
PIGS AND BLAMED MILITARY SEXUAL
ASSAULT ON THE PRESENCE OF WOMEN
IN OUR ARMED FORCES.
[BOOING] MAYOR DE BLASIO: HE'S DEGRADED WOMEN TO MAKE HIMSELF FEEL BIG,
WHILE SHOWING US THE TRULY
LITTLE MAN THAT HE IS.
WHEN -- WHEN HILLARY CLINTON
RAISES HER RIGHT HAND ON INAUGURATION DAY, SHE WILL BE ARMED WITH THE MOST PROGRESSIVE AGENDA IN MODERN TIMES, ONE THAT REWARDS WORK INSTEAD OF WEALTH, ONE THAT FLIPS THE SCRIPT ON ECONOMIC POLICIES OF AND BY AND FOR THE 1%.
FROM PAID SICK LEAVE AND PAID
FAMILY LEAVE TO UNIVERSAL PRE-K AND DEBT-FREE COLLEGE, FROM ENDING TAX LOOPHOLES FOR WALL
STREET AND BILLIONAIRE INVESTORS, TO ADDRESSING THE
NEEDS OF AMERICAN CITIES ON HOUSING, INFRASTRUCTURE, IMMIGRATION. HILLARY CLINTON WILL TACKLE
INEQUALITY AND BE A FORCE FOR REAL, PROGRESSIVE CHANGE IN THIS NATION.
NOW, HOW DOES DONALD SEE THE
ECONOMIC REALITIES FACING THE AMERICAN PEOPLE?
ACTUALLY, HE ROOTS FOR ECONOMIC TURMOIL FOR HIS OWN PERSONAL GAIN.
YOU WANT A REAL-LIFE EXAMPLE? WHEN ASKED IN 2006 ABOUT A POSSIBLE REAL ESTATE CRASH, HE SAID, QUOTE, I SORT OF HOPE THAT HAPPENS BECAUSE THEN PEOPLE LIKE
ME WILL GO IN AND BUY.
THAT IS THE VERY DEFINITION OF THE PREDATOR CLASS.
AND NOW, HE WANTS TO GO FURTHER AND REPEAL THE NEW RULES WE PUT IN PLACE TO MAKE WALL STREET MORE ACCOUNTABLE. THROUGHOUT HER CAREER, AS WE
HEARD SO CLEARLY LAST NIGHT,
HILLARY CLINTON HAS TAKEN ON THE TOUGH BATTLES FOR ONE REASON, BECAUSE STANDING UP FOR THOSE WITHOUT MUCH MONEY AND WITHOUT MUCH POWER HAS BEEN HER LIFE'S CALLING. HILLARY CLINTON, SHE'S SMART, SHE'S STEADY, SHE'S RIGHT AND SHE'S READY!
[APPLAUSE] MAYOR DE BLASIO: DONALD TRUMP, HE'S RECKLESS, HE'S RISKY, HE'S WRONG AND HE'S SCARY! IF YOU CARE ABOUT FIGHTING INCOME INEQUALITY, ABOUT LIFTING
UP FAMILIES AND CHILDREN, ABOUT
BUILDING UP AMERICA'S GREAT
CITIES, THEN LET'S COME TOGETHER, FIGHT TOGETHER, AND LET'S ELECT HILLARY CLINTON, THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THESE UNITED
STATES! THANK YOU!

<strong>Ben Lujan</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> REP. LUJAN: I COME FROM A FAMILY
OF PIONEERS. MY GRANDPARENTS TOOK ON THE
ELEMENTS, LIVED THROUGH THE
GREAT DEPRESSION, SURVIVED POVERTY AND FAMILY TRAGEDY,<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> AND
MADE A PLACE FOR THEMSELVES IN
NEW MEXICO BEFORE IT WAS A STATE.
TILLED THEIR LAND, RAISED THEIR
CROPS, PROTECTED WHAT THEY HAD
AND TRIED TO HELP OTHERS. I GREW UP ON THAT SMALL FARM.
I SPENT MY CHILDHOOD TURNING DIRT, STACKING WOOD, FEEDING ANIMALS.
WE DIDN'T HAVE MUCH BUT WE HAD
EACH OTHER. WE HAD FAMILIA. MY DAD WAS A UNION IRON WORKER, LOCAL 495.
MY MOM HAD A JOB WITH THE LOCAL
SCHOOL DISTRICT.
THEY WERE MARRIED FOR 53 YEARS
BEFORE DAD PASSED.
DAD'S PARENTS BEFORE HIM WERE
MARRIED EVEN LONGER, 74 YEARS.
GRANDPA, A SHEEP HERDER WHO
FIRST PUT DOWN ROOTS IN NEW
MEXICO, WAS BORN IN THE ERA OF
THE HORSE AND BUGGY BUT LIVED TO SEE THE SPACE SHUTTLE SOAR INTO THE HEAVENS. MY MOM'S DAD, GRANDPA LUIS, HE
WAS A UNION CARPENTER WHO WENT
OFF TO SERVE IN WORLD WAR II WHILE HIS WIFE RAISED THE FAMILY AND WAS EXPECTING THEIR SEVENTH
CHILD. HE EARNED A BRONZE STAR FOR HIS HEROISM. WHEN I WAS YOUNG, MY GRANDPA AND GRANDMA HELPED CARE FOR US.
WHEN I WAS OLDER, THEY WERE HURT IN A CAR CRASH SO WE HELPED CARE
FOR THEM BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT FAMILIES DO. THOSE ARE THE VALUES I LEARNED
GROWING UP.
THAT'S WHY I'M HERE TODAY. I KNOW I MIGHT NOT LOOK LIKE
YOUR TYPICAL MEMBER OF CONGRESS
AND IT'S TRUE, I HAVEN'T REALLY GOTTEN THE BOLO TIE LOOK TO CATCH ON. BUT THE STORY OF MY FAMILY IS
THE STORY OF MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF OTHER FAMILIES. IT'S THE STORY OF THE GREAT AMERICAN FAMILY -- CARPENTERS
AND IRON WORKERS, SHEEP HERDERS
AND SOLDIERS. GENERATIONS OF AMERICANS HAVE
WORKED HARD AND LOOKED OUT FOR
EACH OTHER, SERVING AND
SACRIFICING FOR THE NEXT GENERATION.
WE ALL GATHER TOGETHER TO
CELEBRATE THE GOOD TIMES.
WE ALL RALLY AROUND EACH OTHER
IN TIMES OF HARDSHIP AND TRAGEDY.
WE ALL TRY TO LEAVE THINGS A
LITTLE BETTER THAN WE FOUND THEM
AND THESE VALUES HOLD TRUE NO
MATTER WHO YOU ARE OR WHERE YOU
COME FROM.
AS DEMOCRATS, WE BELIEVE THAT
EVERYBODY IN AMERICA SHOULD HAVE THE SAME OPPORTUNITY MY GRANDPARENTS AND PARENTS HAD, TO HAVE A PLACE OF YOUR OWN, TO BUILD SOME REAL ECONOMIC SECURITY THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY WILL DISAPPEAR OVERNIGHT,
TO PASS SOMETHING ON TO YOUR
KIDS AND GRANDKIDS.
THOSE ARE THE VALUES THAT BUILT OUR PARTY AND FOR A CENTURY WE HAVE LED THE FIGHT FOR SOCIAL
SECURITY AND MEDICARE, FOR PEL
GRANTS AND THE G.I. BILL, FOR
UNIVERSAL HEALTHCARE, FOR
INCLUSION AND EQUALITY AND OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL. WE ARE PROUD OF OUR ACCOMPLISHMENTS BUT NOW IT'S OUR
TURN TO CONTINUE THAT TRADITION. WE, TOO, MUST LEAVE THINGS
BETTER THAN WE FOUND THEM AND
HILLARY CLINTON IS THE PRESIDENT
WHO WILL LEAD US!
[APPLAUSE] REP. LUJAN: BUT SHE NEEDS A
CONGRESS THAT WILL WORK WITH
HER.
FOR NEARLY SIX YEARS,
REPUBLICANS HAVE HELD THE
MAJORITY IN THE PEOPLE'S HOUSE
BUT CLINGING TO THAT MAJORITY IS
THE ONLY THING THEY'VE ACCOMPLISHED.
FOR NEARLY SIX YEARS, HOUSE
REPUBLICANS HAVE PUT PARTY OVER COUNTRY.
FOR NEARLY SIX YEARS, THEY'VE
BEEN AFRAID TO STAND UP TO THE THE BIGOTS AND CONSPIRACY THEORISTS LIKE THE ONE THEY JUST
NOMINATED FOR PRESIDENT. MILLIONS HAVE JOINED US FROM REJECTING DONALD TRUMP'S BULLYING, RACISM, AND HIS ATTEMPT TO DIVIDE OUR AMERICAN FAMILY.
GROWING UP, MY GRANDPARENTS
SHARED WITH ME THE AGE-OLD WISDOM -- TELL ME WHO YOU WALK
WITH AND I'LL TELL YOU WHO YOU
ARE. FOR ME, THE CHOICE IS EASY. I'M VERY REAL LEADERSHIP, SOMEONE WITH CHARACTER AND VALUES.
I'M PROUD TO WALK WITH HILLARY CLINTON BUT IF YOUR MEMBER OF CONGRESS IS SUPPORTING DONALD
TRUMP, INSTEAD ASK YOURSELF
THIS. OF WHAT DOES THAT SAY ABOUT THEIR LEADERSHIP, THEIR CHARACTER, THEIR VALUES, IF THEY WON'T EVEN STAND UP TO DONALD
TRUMP, WHAT MAKES YOU THINK THEY'LL STAND UP FOR YOU AND YOUR FAMILY?</span><span class='hidden-full-transcript-ellipses'>...</span></p><a href='#' class='hidden-full-transcript-link'><i class='icon-chevron-down'></i> <span class='link-show-full-text'>Show Full Text</span><i class='icon-chevron-up'></i> <span class='link-show-less-text'>Show Less Text</span></a>

GENERATIONS. THE PROBLEMS IN FLINT ARE NOT
OVER. THE WATER IS STILL NOT SAFE TO DRINK OR COOK WITH FROM THE TAP.
OUR INFRASTRUCTURE IS BROKEN LEAKING AND RUSTING AWAY. I LOOK OLD ECONOMY STRUGGLES TO REBOUND AND THERE ARE MANY MORE
FLAMES ACROSS THE COUNTRY WHERE
ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES ARE HURTING
OUR KIDS AND FAMILY. TODAY THE HELP WE NEED IS LOCKED
IN THE REPUBLICAN-CONTROLLED U.S. CONGRESS. I AM A VOICE FOR FLINT AND WE
NEED YOUR HELP.
[APPLAUSE] DO YOU KNOW WHO HAS ALSO HEARD
THE CALL FROM FLINT? HILLARY CLINTON. SHE CAME TO FLINT WHEN THE WATER
CRISIS HEAD.
SHE JOINED WITH OUR COMMUNITY GROUPS AND HOURS OF THE LEADERS
AND CHURCHES. SHE SAID I WILL DO EVERYTHING I
CAN TO HELP YOU GET YOUR
STRENGTH AND RESILIENCE FLOWING
THROUGH FLINT AGAIN. THE FLINT WATERWORKS PROGRAM IS
NOW PUTTING THE YOUNG ADULTS PROGRAM INTO NEW JOBS AND
REBUILDING THEIR OWN
COMMUNITIES. HILLARY'S WONDERFUL DAUGHTER CHELSEA CAME TO FLINT TO HELP
START THIS WORK AND CREATE NEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR OUR FAMILY. SOME MONTHS LATER, SHE CAME BACK
TO FLINT AGAIN TO SAY THAT THE BROKEN INFRASTRUCTURE IS A NATIONAL CRISIS. IT IS NOT JUST A FLINT CRISIS. SHE MADE A COMMITMENT THAT SHE
WOULD WORK FOR A LEADFREE AMERICA. THAT IS WHY I AM WITH HER. JOIN WITH FLINT TO GET BEHIND HILLARY CLINTON TO RAISE OUR

<strong>Stephanie Schriock</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> MS. SCHRIOCK: 100 YEARS AGO THIS NOVEMBER A SOCIAL WORKER FROM MY HOME STATE OF MONTANA BECAME THE FIRST WOMAN ELECTED EVER TO CONGRESS. THE FIRST, BUT<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> NOT THE LAST. ONCE THAT BARRIER FELL THERE WAS
NO TURNING BACK. OVER 31 YEARS, EMILY'S LIST HAS ELECTED HUNDREDS OF MORE WOMEN
INTO THE HOUSE AND THE SENATE
AND EVERY OTHER OFFICE ON THE
BALLOT. EXCEPT ONE. HILLARY CLINTON BE OUR FIRST
WOMAN PRESIDENT. SHE WILL NOT BE OUR LAST. ONCE THAT BARRIER FALLS, IT WILL
NEVER BE PUT BACK UP. THE WOMEN WE HAVE ELECTED HAVE
NOT JUST BROUGHT NEW VOICES TO
THE DEBATE THEY HAVE BROUGHT NEW MOMENTUM TO THE PROGRESSIVE
MOVEMENT. WOMEN DON'T JUST FIGHT FOR WOMEN
. THEY FIGHT FOR FAMILIES, THEY
FIGHT FOR FAIRNESS, INCLUSION
AND JUSTICE. NO WONDER REPUBLICAN LEADERS
OPPOSE EQUAL PAY FOR WOMEN AND
REFUSE TO STAND UP FOR WORKING MOTHERS TO -- TRYING TO BALANCE
CAREER AND FAMILY. THAT IS WHY THEY LET YOUR BOSS
FIRE YOU FOR USING BIRTH CONTROL
AND FORCE US TO UNDERGO INVASIVE
TRANSVAGINAL ULTRASOUNDS. THEY DON'T RESPECT WOMEN. THEY DON'T TRUST WOMEN. THEY WANT TO CONTROL WOMEN. THEY ARE AFRAID OF THE CHANGE WE BRING, THE PROGRESS WE MAKE WHEN
WE GET A CHANCE TO LEAD. THEY ARE TERRIFIED OF HILLARY
CLINTON. NO MATTER WHAT THEY THROW AT HER, THEY HAVE NEVER BEEN ABLE
TO STOP HER. FROM LITTLE ROCK TO BEIJING, SHE FOUGHT FOR FAIRNESS, FOR
INCLUSION, FOR JUSTICE. SHE HAS ONE.
-- WON. THEY ARE MAKING THEIR LAST TO
STAND FOR ALL OF US FOR THOSE
WHO HAVE TRIED TO MAKE PROGRESS
IN AMERICA. THEY ARE DESPERATE, THAT MEANS
THEY ARE DANGEROUS -- THEY
NOMINATED A MAN WHO SAID WOMEN
SHOULD BE PUNISHED FOR HAVING AN
ABORTION. THAT -- WHO HAS CALLED US FAT CAKES AND ANIMALS.
HE PICKED A RUNNING MATE WHO LED
THE FIGHT TO DESTROY PLANNED PARENTHOOD AND TRY TO REDEFINE
RAPE AND SUGGEST THAT MOTHERS WHO WORK STUMP THE EMOTIONAL GROWTH OF THEIR KIDS BY PUTTING THEM IN DAY CARE.
IF THEY WIN, THEY WILL NEED EVERY OUNCE OF PROGRESS WE HAVE DARED TO MAKE. WE HAVE COME TOO FAR TO LET THAT
HAPPENED. LET US SELECT MORE DEMOCRATIC WOMEN OF AND DOWN THE BALLOT. MORE WOMEN IN THE HOUSE, MORE WOMEN IN THE SENATE.
I'M NOT TO TAKE THE MAJORITY. LET'S DECIDE RIGHT HERE AND NOW TO BREAK THROUGH THAT LAST
BARRIER. AND AT LONG LAST PUT A WOMAN IN
THE WHITE HOUSE. HILLARY CLINTON OUR FIRST WOMEN PRESIDENT. NOT OUR LAST.</span><span class='hidden-full-transcript-ellipses'>...</span></p><a href='#' class='hidden-full-transcript-link'><i class='icon-chevron-down'></i> <span class='link-show-full-text'>Show Full Text</span><i class='icon-chevron-up'></i> <span class='link-show-less-text'>Show Less Text</span></a>

<strong>Harry Reid</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> SEN. REID: THANK YOU EVERYBODY. WINKY.
-- THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
(CHANTING) I SPENT A LOT OF TIME IN THE
REPUBLICAN SENATE.
IT IS NICE TO BE<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> IN A ROOM THAT RESPECTS REASON AND FACT. I APPRECIATE THIS TRIBUTE. I REALLY DO. ANYTHING I'VE ACCOMPLISHED IN THE SENATE, MY DEMOCRATIC SENATE CAUCUS, NANCY PELOSI IN THE
HOUSE. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA. VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN. I GET A NEVER ENDING TRIBUTE TO
HILLARY CLINTON. WE HAVE FOUGHT THAT AFFORDABLE
HEALTH CARE IS A RIGHT, NOT A
PRIVILEGE. WE FOUGHT FOR THE IDEA THAT YOU
SHOULDN'T GET THE BILL FOR WALL STREET'S BABETTE. AS A TEAM, WE FOUGHT FOR THE
PROMISE THAT YOUR HARD EARNED
SOCIAL SECURITY IS A SACRED TRUST. DONALD TRUMP AND MIKE PENCE WANT TO PUT INSURANCE COMPANIES BACK IN CHARGE OF YOUR HEALTH. DONALD TRUMP AND MIKE PENCE WANT TO LET BIG BANKS WERE -- RUN
WILD AGAIN. THEY WANT TO GAMBLE WITH YOUR RETIREMENT BENEFITS IN THE STOCK MARKET. REPUBLICANS WANT TO TEAR DOWN THE KILLERS OF MIDDLE-CLASS SECURITY. WE WON'T LET THAT HAPPEN.
[APPLAUSE] I HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING MORE
CRAVEN THAN MITCH MCCONNELL AND
WHAT HE HAS DONE TO OUR DEMOCRACY. HIS REPUBLICAN PARTY DECIDED
THAT THE ANSWER TO HARD-WORKING
DREAMS IS TO SLANDER OUR
AFRICAN-AMERICAN PRESIDENT.
TO STOKE FEAR OF MUSLIMS, TO
STOKE HATRED OF LATINOS AND OF
COURSE WAGE WAR AGAINST WOMEN. IN OTHER WORDS, THE ONLY THING
REPUBLICANS LIKE MITCH MCCONNELL
HAVE ACCOMPLISHED IS SETTING THE STAGE FOR A HATEFUL CON MAN,
DONALD TRUMP. WHEN DONALD TRUMP DECIDED TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT, HE PROBABLY SAID HIMSELF, I'M AN EGOMANIAC. I BELIEVE IN SCIENCE. I THINK WOMEN ARE INFERIOR. WHERE WOULD I FEEL AT HOME?
WE KNOW WHERE THAT IS. PARENTS, YOU ARE RIGHT TO FEAR
WHAT COMES OUT OF HIS MOUTH. REPUBLICANS, YOU SHOULD HAVE
BEEN CAREFUL ALSO. HE LEARNED IT FROM WATCHING YOU. THEY SAY THEY BELIEVE IN COUNTRY FIRST.
WHAT A JOKE. PUBLICANS THAT WON'T STAND UP TO TRUMP BELIEVE IN ONE THING ONLY. PARTY FIRST AND THIS YEAR, THEY
HAVE GONE EVEN FURTHER. NOMINATING THE POSTER CHILD OF ME FIRST. TRUMP KNEW THAT HATEFUL RHETORIC IS THE WAY TO WIN IN TODAY'S
GOP. THAT IS NOT HOW YOU WIN IN AMERICA AND THAT IS NOT HOW
AMERICA WINS IN THE WORLD. DEMOCRATS KNOW WE WIN WITH AN
ECONOMY THAT WORKS FOR EVERYBODY
, WITH A STRONG AND SMART NATIONAL SECURITY THAT DOES NOT
INVITE A CYBER ATTACK ON OUR
COUNTRY. WE KNOW THAT WINNING IS THE WORK
OF THE TEAM. WITH HILLARY AND THE WHITE HOUSE
AND A MAJORITY IN THE SENATE, DEMOCRATS WILL KEEP FIGHTING FOR
IMMIGRATION REFORM THAT KEEPS
AMERICA TRUE. CLEAN ENERGY AND ASSUME -- A
SUPREME COURT THAT KEEPS AMERICA JUST.
AND BACKGROUND CHECKS FOR GUN VIOLATORS AND AN ASSAULT WEAPONS
BAN THAT KEEPS AMERICA SAFE.
[APPLAUSE] SINCE MY DAYS, I HAVE FOUGHT MY
SHARE OF FIGHTS. I'VE ALSO REALIZED A LEADER IS
ACTUALLY A CORNER MAN, SOMEONE
THAT STANDS ON YOUR SIDE AND HAS
YOUR BACK IN A FIGHT. MIDDLE-CLASS LIFE. DEMOCRATS STAND IN YOUR CORNER. AMERICANS FIGHTING FOR EQUALITY AND RESPECT, WE ARE IN YOUR
CORNER. NEW AMERICANS RISKING EVERYTHING
TO GET HERE AND FIGHTING TO MAKE
IT HERE, WE ARE IN YOUR CORNER. YOU ARE THE ONES FIGHTING THE
HARDEST FIGHT.
YOU ARE THE ONES WHO NEED
LEADERS IN YOUR CORNER. LEADERS LIKE MY FOREVER FRIEND BERNIE SANDERS. LEADERS LIKE -- USE FUND HELP
DEMOCRATS TAKE BACK THE SENATE.
LEADERS TO NEVER BACK DOWN AND OH, DO WE LOVE KIM.
WE REALLY DO. LEADERS WHO HAVE HAD YOUR BACK
THEIR WHOLE LIVES, LIKE HILLARY
CLINTON.
THE MOST QUALIFIED CANDIDATE IN
THE HISTORY OF AMERICA. IN A FEW MONTHS, I WILL BE
STEPPING OUT OF THE RAIN -- RING
ONE LAST TIME. BUT DEMOCRATS WILL ALWAYS BE IN YOUR CORNER. TOGETHER BUT KEEP FIGHTING. FIGHTING THE GOOD FIGHT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

-- NEWSOM: I'M A PROUD DEMOCRAT FROM THE GREAT STATE OF

[CHEERS] I AM PROUD BECAUSE TODAY'S CALIFORNIA, TODAY'S CALIFORNIA
IS STRONG<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> AND GETTING STRONGER. THE JET PROPELLED ENGINE OF JOB CREATION, HOME QUARTER
CREATIVITY AROUND THE WORLD.
WE HAVE DONE IT NOT JUST THROUGH INNOVATION, BUT WE HAVE DONE IT
THROUGH INCLUSION.
WE ARE PRO-IMMIGRANT, PROENVIRONMENT, PRO-WOMEN, PRO-WORKERS, AND PROBABLY
PRO-GAY, LESBIANS, BISEXUALS AND TRANSGENDER.
[APPLAUSE] WE ARE NOT THE GOLDEN STATE
DESPITE OUR VALUES. WE ARE THE GOLDEN STATE BECAUSE
OF THEM.
AT OUR BEST WE DON'T TOLERATE OUR DIVERSITY.
AT OUR BEST WE CELEBRATE IT. THOSE VALUES OF LIBERTY, DIVERSITY, AND OPPORTUNITY. THOSE ARE FUNDAMENTALLY AMERICAN
VALUES. THOSE VALUES ARE UNDER ATTACK
NOT JUST BY ENEMIES ABROAD, BUT
BY A GOP THAT HAS MOVED ITS FEAR
MONGERING FRENCH TO CENTER STAGE
-- FRINGE TO CENTER STAGE. WHAT DONALD TRUMP PRESENTED LAST WEEK WAS NOT POLITICAL
DISCOURSE. IT WASN'T EVEN CLINICAL
INCORRECTNESS. WHAT TRUMP PRESENTED WITH THE FETUS AND -- DEFEATIST AND RETREATIST. NEVER HAS A SPEECH BEEN SO LONG
WAS SO LITTLE SUBSTANCE, SCIENCE, HUMANITY, HUMOR OR SO
LITTLE HOPE. HIS HOSTILE TAKEOVER OF THE AMERICAN DREAM IS BUILT ON TWO
FUNDAMENTAL LIES. THAT AMERICA IS A DARK AND
DESPERATE PLACE, AND THAT HE HAS
THE KIND OF PLAN TO MAKE IT
BETTER. TRUMP STRANGLED US, THE SUNNY OPTIMISM OF RONALD REAGAN AND REPLACED "TEAR DOWN THAT WALL" WITH THE BIGOTRY OF "BILL THAT
WILL." MALICE TOWARDS DIFFERENT VIEWS AND DIFFERENT HUES. THOSE ARE DISQUALIFICATIONS FROM
ANY OFFICE, LET ALONE THE
HIGHEST OFFICE IN THE LAND.
[APPLAUSE] AND DEMOCRATS, WHILE IT WAS REFRESHING TO FINALLY SEE AN
OPENLY GAY MAN SPEAK AT A REPUBLICAN CONVENTION, IT DOES NOT REMOVE THE STAIN OF
SELECTING MIKE PENCE, AMERICA'S
MOST ANTI-LGBT GOVERNOR.
[APPLAUSE] PENCE SUPPORTED OVERT
DISCRIMINATION. HE ADVOCATED FOR DIVERTING TAXPAYER DOLLARS TO SO-CALLED
CONVERSION THERAPY. MAKE NO MISTAKE. CONVERSION THERAPY IS NOT ABOUT
PRAYING A WAY TO GET A.
-- AWAY THE GAY. IT'S A TORTURE AGAINST OUR MOST INNOCENT CITIZENS, OUR CHILDREN. TELLING THEM THAT TO LIVE THEY MUST APPLY -- LIE ABOUT WHO THEY
ARE AND WHO THEY LOVE. THAT IS FUNDAMENTALLY
UN-AMERICAN. THE AGE-OLD CHOICE HAS NEVER BEEN MORE CLEAR. WE CAN LIVE OUR FEARS, ALL WE
CAN LIVE OUR DREAMS. HILLARY CLINTON IS DEDICATED HER
ENTIRE LIFE TO PUTTING THE
AMERICAN DREAM WITHIN REACH. SHE BELIEVES IN DIVERSITY OVER DIVISION. THE HARD WORK OF PLURALISM OVER THE ILLUSION OF DIFFERENCES AND AS A FATHER OF FOUR I WANT
TO SAY THIS. I WANT TO SAY SOMETHING TO ALL
THE CHILDREN WHO WERE WATCHING,
ALL THE CHILDREN THAT ARE LISTENING AT HOME. WHEN YOU HEAR PEOPLE SAY THAT YOU AND YOUR FAMILY DON'T MATTER
BECAUSE OF WHO YOU ARE OR WHERE YOU COME FROM OR WHAT YOU LOOK
LIKE OR YOU LOVE, I WANT YOU TO
KNOW ONE THING. THE PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM, THE PEOPLE ALL ACROSS THIS COUNTRY BELIEVE YOU MATTER. HILLARY CLINTON BELIEVES YOU
MATTER. WE BELIEVE THAT YOU BELONG HERE. WE NEED YOU HERE. WE BELIEVE YOU CAN BE WHOEVER YOU ARE AND BECOME WHATEVER YOU
WANT TO BE. WE WILL FIGHT FOR YOU.
WE WILL FIGHT FOR YOU NOT JUST OVER THE NEXT 100 DAYS, BUT OVER
THE NEXT 100 YEARS. NO MATTER HOW -- WHAT PEOPLE TELL YOU, THAT IS WHAT AMERICA
IS ALL ABOUT. THAT IS WHAT MAKES AMERICA GREAT.

<strong>Ruben Gallego</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> REP. GALLEGO: THANK YOU, THANK
YOU. THESE DAYS SOME PEOPLE, CONGRESSMAN. THE PROUDEST TITLE I'VE EVER HAD
IS THAT IT UNITED STATES MARINE. I SERVED IN<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> IRAQ, AND THE LEGENDARY LIMA COMPANY OUT OF OHIO. DEPLOY BEHIND -- BESIDES ME WERE
THE SONS OF NATIVE AMERICANS, AFRICAN AMERICANS, MIDWESTERN WHITE BOYS, AND MUSLIM AMERICANS
AS WELL.
[APPLAUSE] WHILE WE WERE LOOKING FOR INSURGENTS IN IRAQ WE DO NOT CARE ABOUT EACH OTHER'S RACE OR
RELIGION. WE FOUGHT TOGETHER. WE LAUGHED TOGETHER AND WE
MOURNED TOGETHER. PATRIOTISM, SERVICE, AND
SACRIFICE. KEEPING YOUR WORD. THOSE ARE THE VALUES OF UNITED
STATES MARINE CORPS.
THOSE OVER AMERICAN VALUES. THOSE ARE NOT DONALD TRUMP'S VALUES. DONALD TRUMP IS A MAN WHO QUESTIONS THE LOYALTY OF THOSE
WHO SERVE OUR COUNTRY WITHOUT EVER HIMSELF SERVING. THAT IS NOT PATRIOTIC. SERVICE AND SACRIFICE? DONALD TRUMP SAYS ABOUT SENATOR MCCAIN, "LOTS OF PEOPLE WERE NOT
CAPTURED." AS A MARINE, AS AN AMERICAN, I
AM OFFENDED. WHEN IT COMES TO HONORING THE
SERVICE OF OUR TROOPS, TRUMP HAS
INSPIRED THE MISS WORK BECAUSE
OF THEIR DUTY.
THAT IS NOT JUST ILLEGAL, IT IS IMMORAL. AND SET OF KEEPING HIS WORD TO VETERANS, HE HAS USED US AS AN
EXCUSE TO BACK OUT OF DEBATES
THEN FAILED FOR MONTHS TO DELIVER ON THE DONATION HE PROMISED TO VETERANS. ONE OF MY FELLOW MARINES CALLED TRUMP UNIVERSITY A COMPLETE CON. I SAY THAT ABOUT DONALD TRUMP
HIMSELF.
[CHEERS] DONALD TRUMP IS A SCAM ARTIST. HE IS TRYING TO PULL OFF THE ULTIMATE SCAM, PRETENDING HE
CARES ABOUT VETERANS. HILLARY CLINTON IS THE REAL
DEAL. SHE FOUGHT FOR THE POST-9/11 G.I. BILL AND THE SENATE TO SEND
OUR VETERANS A COLLEGE. SHE EXTENDED HEALTH INSURANCE TO AMERICA'S RESERVISTS, AND SHE
HAS A REAL PLAN TO COMBAT VETERANS HOMELESSNESS. MEANWHILE, WHEN TRUMP SAW
DISABLED VETERANS LEGALLY
SELLING MERCHANDISE IN FRONT OF
HIS PROPERTIES HE SAID THERE WORK WAS DOWNGRADING THE
AREA. LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING, DONALD, OUR VETERANS DON'T
DOWNGRADE YOUR REAL ESTATE. THEY UPGRADE OUR COUNTRY.
[CHEERS] DONALD PRAISES DICTATORS OF
INSULT OUR ALLIES. HIS FOREIGN POLICY BE BASED ON FALSE BRAVADO AND BLUSTER. I KNOW THE IMPORTANCE OF A
COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF WHO MAKES THOUGHTFUL DECISIONS WITH THE
MOST IMPORTANT WILL -- POWER THEY HAVE. TO SEND OUR MEN AND WOMEN INTO
BATTLE. WE NEED A PRESIDENT WHO HONORS THE SERVICE OF OUR TROOPS ABROAD AND HE RESPECTS THEIR SACRIFICE
WHEN THEY COME HOME. A LEADER WHO PROVIDES STEADY LEADERSHIP AND PROTECTS AMERICAN
VALUES. WE NEED HILLARY CLINTON AS THE
NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.
THANK YOU.

HE WAS A FAMILY MAN. WHATEVER TIME HE WAS ABLE<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> TO

WHATEVER HE CAN DO TO HELP THEM PROTECT, THAT IS WHAT HE

HE REALIZED HE COULD DO THAT AND FLY IF HE JOINED THE ARMY. HE TOOK THE JOB VERY SERIOUSLY. ANY TIME HE WAS HOME HE ANSWERED
TO THAT LITTLE GIRL.
WE WERE HIS WORLD. PATRICK WAS IN IRAQ IN TWO DOZEN FOR.
HIS UNIT WAS CALLED OUT TO DO A
SEARCH AND RESCUE. PATRICK CRASHED TRYING TO SAVE
THE LIVES OF OTHERS. THAT WAS THE KIND OF PERSON HE WAS. I WAS NUMB. I LOST MY HUSBAND, MY BEST FRIEND, AND MY DAUGHTER LOST HER DAD. LOSING PAT SHOOK OUR FOUNDATION. IT WAS LIKE, OK, WHAT DO WE DO NEXT? HILLARY CLINTON RELEASED SOME OF
THE FINANCIAL STRESS. Y -- IT ALLOWED ME TO FOCUS ON ME AND MY DAUGHTER, TO HEAL,
TO GIVE HER A STABLE HOME. WHAT HILLARY HAS DONE FOR OUR FAMILY AND OTHER MILITARY FAMILIES, WORDS CAN'T EVEN DESCRIBE IT. SHE UNDERSTANDS WHAT OUR COUNTRY
NEEDS. 12 YEARS AGO SHE UNDERSTOOD WHAT

<p class='short_transcript'> MRS. DORFF: THANK YOU, THANK
YOU. I WILL NEVER FORGET THE MOMENT I
HEARD THAT PATRICK'S HELICOPTER DID NOT RETURN. IN AN INSTANT THE LIFE I KNEW
WAS DESTROYED.<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> THE PARTNER I LOVED DAWN.
-- GONE. MY DAUGHTER'S FATHER TAKEN AWAY
FOREVER. I NEVER FELT MORE SCARED OR ALONE THAN I DID THEN. I WONDERED WHAT CHRISTMAS AND
BIRTHDAYS WITH LOOK LIKE. HALF THE COUNTRY AWAY, A UNITED
STATES SENATOR WAS LOOKING OUT FOR ME AND COUNTLESS OTHERS LIKE
ME. HER NAME WAS HILLARY CLINTON. BEFORE HILLARY, THE FAMILY'S RECEIVED $12,000. YET WHEN YOU NEED TO BURY YOUR BEST FRIEND, WHEN YOU NEED TO RAISE A CHILD UNDER OWN, WHEN
YOU NEED TO REBUILD YOUR LIFE FROM RUBBLE, $12,000 DOES NOT GO
FAR. HILLARY UNDERSTOOD SO SHE DID
SOMETHING ABOUT IT. WITHOUT FUSS OR FANFARE, SHE
WORKED ACROSS PARTY LINES. SHE LED CONGRESS TO INCREASE SURVIVOR BENEFITS TO $100,000. IT MADE ALL THE DIFFERENCE IN
THE WORLD.
[APPLAUSE] LOOKING BACK ON IT, I DIDN'T
EVEN REALIZE IT WAS RESPONSIBLE. WHEN I DID LEARN ABOUT HILLARY'S WORK, I DIDN'T SEE HER AS A DEMOCRAT OR A REPUBLICAN. I SIMPLY SAW FIGHTER FOR PEOPLE LIKE US, FOR FAMILIES LIKE MINE. SHE STOOD UP FOR THE PRINCIPLES
THAT A FAMILY'S PERSONAL TRAGEDY
WAS NOT BE A FINANCIAL TRAGEDY
AS WELL. TODAY MY DAUGHTER IS FINISHING HIGH SCHOOL. SHE IS COMPLETING HER DEGREE, I'M COMPLETING MY DEGREE IN
EMERGENCY CRISIS MANAGEMENT. COMMITTED TO SERVING MY COUNTRY
IN THE BEST WAY I CAN.
[APPLAUSE] AND OUR FAMILY IS MAKING IT. STEP-BY-STEP, DAY BY DAY. HILLARY CLINTON HAS FOUGHT FOR
FAMILIES LIKE MINE EACH AND
EVERY DAY OF HER CAREER. THIS IS A WOMAN WHO I HAVE NEVER MET WHOSE LIFE'S BEEN NOT
BE ANY MORE DIFFERENT FROM MY OWN, BUT WHO HAS TO WITH MY
FAMILY AND ME OVER AND OVER AGAIN. HILLARY HAS ALWAYS BEEN WITH ME
AND BAD TIMES AND THAT IS WHY
I'M WITH HER. THANK YOU.

UP YET.
THANK YOU -- GOOD EVENING,
PHILADELPHIA. THANK YOU FOR THE EXTRAORDINAIRE
HOSPITALITY YOU HAVE SHOWN US
ALL WEEK.<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> TO MY FRIENDS IN MICHIGAN, THANK
YOU FOR THAT RECEPTION. I WAS BORN IN DETROIT AND FOR DECADES I WATCHED OUR CITY LOSE
TENS OF THOUSANDS OF JOBS.
I AM 58 YEARS OLD AND THE
POPULATION OF DETROIT HAS
DECLINED EVERY SINGLE YEAR I
HAVE BEEN ALIVE. BUT THAT IS CHANGING NOW. AS OUR CITY'S RECOVERY IS FUELED
BY A RENEWED SPIRIT OF UNITY AND
A COMMITMENT TO CREATING A COME BACK THAT INCLUDES ALL DETROITERS. THAT IS THE IDEA THAT DRIVES US,
AND IT DRIVES HILLARY CLINTON
BECAUSE WHEN SHE LOOKS AT DETROIT AND EVERY OTHER CITY IN AMERICA, SHE SEES THE
OPPORTUNITY TO CREATE AN ECONOMY
IN WHICH EVERYONE BENEFITS. THAT IS THE STRONG, STEADY
LEADERSHIP AMERICA NEEDS. WHEN I RAN FOR MAYOR OF DETROIT I RAN ON A MESSAGE THAT SAID WE
ARE GOING TO END OUR HISTORIC
DIVISION. EVERY NIGHT FOR AN ENTIRE YEAR I
FINISHED EVERY EVENT BY SAYING THIS, WE ARE GOING TO BUILD A
DETROIT WHERE IT NO LONGER
MATTERS IF YOU ARE BLACK, BROWN OR WHITE, WHERE IT NO LONGER MATTERS IF YOU ARE CHRISTIAN,
JEWISH, OR MUSLIM. WHERE HAD NO WATER -- NO LONGER MATTERS IF YOU'RE GAY, STRAIGHT, AN IMMIGRANT, BORN IN DETROIT,
EVERYBODY WILL BE EQUALLY VALUED
AND EVERYONE WILL HAVE REAL
OPPORTUNITY. AND WITH MY PARTNERS AT THE
DETROIT CITY COUNCIL, AND COUNCIL PRESIDENT BRENDA JONES, THAT IS THE CITY STARTING TO
EMERGE. DETROIT IS 18 MONTHS OUT OF
BANKRUPTCY. SOMETHING DONALD TRUMP KNOWS A
LITTLE BIT ABOUT. UNLIKE DONALD TRUMP, DETROIT IS
ONLY GOING TO SEE BANKRUPTCY
WANTS.
-- ONCE. THANKS TO A GREAT PARTNERSHIP
WITH PRESIDENT OBAMA, VICE
PRESIDENT BIDEN, AND THE ADMINISTRATION'S EXTRAORDINARY
ECONOMIC RECORD OF CREATING 14
MILLION NEW JOBS, JOBS ARE
RETURNING TO DETROIT. NEW AUTO PLANTS AND BUSINESSES
ARE OPENING.
IN DETROIT UNEMPLOYMENT RATES
HAVE BEEN CUT IN HALF. PEOPLE ARE MOVING BACK TO OUR
CITY IN HUGE NUMBERS. BUT DETROIT'S TRUE TEST IS THE
SAME TEST FACING THE NEXT
PRESIDENT. ARE WE CREATING AN ECONOMY THAT
WORKS FOR EVERYONE OR JUST FOR
THOSE AT THE TOP? IN FOUR NIGHTS IN CLEVELAND DID
YOU HEAR A SINGLE IDEA ON HOW TO DO THAT? DID YOU HEAR ANY PLAN TO PROTECT WORKING FAMILIES? NO. YOU HEARD INSULT AND FEAR
MONGERING. YOU HURT ANGRY, IRRATIONAL RHETORIC PARROTING A SLOGAN ON
HATS. COMPARE THAT TO WHAT YOU HEARD AND WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO HEAR FROM HILLARY CLINTON. CREATING GOOD PAYING JOBS BY
INVESTING IN INFRASTRUCTURE AND CLEAN ENERGY, OFFERING TAX CREDITS TO COMPANIES THAT CREATE
REAL JOB TRAINING FOR APPRENTICESHIP. HE WANTS TO MAKE COLLEGE DEBT-FREE AND SHE WANTS TO MAKE
-- REWARD COMPANIES THAT WERE
SHARE PROFITS WITH THEIR EMPLOYEES BECAUSE HILLARY
CLINTON KNOWS THE BEST WAY TO
BRING OUR CITIES BACK IS TO GET OUR CITIZENS ARE REAL CHANCE AT
GOOD PAYING JOBS. THAT IS WHY I WANT TO HELP HER BECOME THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE
UNITED STATES.
[CHEERS] I AM MAYOR BECAUSE THE POWER OF
PEOPLE GETTING ENGAGED, AND NO
MATTER WHERE YOU LIVE YOU CAN
IMPACT THE SELECTION EVERY DAY BY DOWNLOADING THE HILLARY APP. TEXT "APP" TO 27246 VOLUNTEER AND THIS NOVEMBER
PLEASE CAST YOUR VOTE FOR
HILLARY CLINTON.
THANK YOU.

<strong>Martin J. O'Malley</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> MARTIN O'MALLEY: THANK YOU.
[CHEERS] MY FELLOW AMERICANS. MY FELLOW AMERICANS, PRESIDENT
OF THE UNITED STATES IS THE
TOUGHEST JOB IN THE WORLD. I COME<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> HERE BEFORE YOU AS A MAN
WHO KNOWS HILLARY CLINTON WELL. I HAVE WORKED ALONGSIDE HER AND
I HAVE COMPETED AGAINST HER, AND
I'M HERE TO TELL YOU HILLARY CLINTON IS AS TOUGH AS THEY
COME.
[CHEERS] SHE WILL STAND UP TO ISIS. SHE WILL STAND UP TO THE
RUSSIANS. AND WITH TIM KAINE AT HER SIDE
SHE WILL NEVER STOP FIGHTING FOR
OUR CHILDREN AND OUR FAMILIES
BECAUSE HILLARY CLINTON KNOWS
WHEN OUR FAMILIES ARE STRONG, AMERICA IS STRONG.
[CHEERS] NOW DONALD TRUMP, HE'S A
DIFFERENT STORY. HE WILL NOT FIGHT FOR US. HE FEEDS OFF OF ECONOMIC FEARS
AND FAILURES. STARS OF FALSE DIVISIONS AND
ANCIENT HATE. TURNS ANGER INTO A POLITICAL WEAPON. BUT MY FRIENDS, ANGER NEVER FED
A HUNGRY CHILD, DID IT? ANCHOR NEVER PROTECTED A FAMILY'S HOME OR SEND A KID TO
COLLEGE. ANGER NEVER BUILT A GREAT REPUBLIC.
I SAY TO HELL WITT TRUMP'S NIGHTMARE. WE BELIEVE IN THE AMERICAN
DREAM. WE BELIEVE, AS HILLARY CLINTON BELIEVES, THAT NO AMERICAN
FAMILY WHO WORKS HARD SHOULD HAVE TO RAISE THEIR CHILDREN IN POVERTY. DONALD TRUMP ON THE OTHER HAND
HAS ACTUALLY SAID, "WAGES ARE TOO HIGH." WAGES ARE TOO HIGH? REALLY, DONALD? I WILL TELL YOU WHAT IS TOO
HIGH. COLLEGE TUITION IS TOO HIGH.
[CHEERS] I WILL TELL YOU WHAT IS TOO
HIGH. THE COST OF CHILDCARE, THAT IS
TOO HIGH.
[CHEERS] THE NUMBER OF AMERICAN CHILDREN WHO LIVE IN POVERTY, THAT IS TOO
HIGH. DONALD TRUMP'S OPINION OF
HIMSELF --
[LAUGHTER] THAT IS WAY TOO HIGH.
[CHEERS] ACTUALLY DONALD, AMERICAN WAGES
IN FACT ARE TOO LOW. OUR ECONOMY ISN'T MONEY, DID HIS
PEOPLE. IT IS ALL OF OUR PEOPLE. AND HILLARY CLINTON IN TIM KAINE
WILL FIGHT TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERY FAMILY WHO IS WILLING TO
WORK HARD CAN ACTUALLY GET AHEAD
AGAIN IN AMERICA.
[CHEERS] ON CLIMATE CHANGE, LIKE YOU AND ME, AND IN FACT LIKE OUR
CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN,
HILLARY CLINTON BELIEVES IN
SCIENCE. SHE UNDERSTANDS THAT CLIMATE
CHANGE IS NOT ONLY A REAL THREAT, IT IS ALSO THE GREATEST
JOB CREATION OPPORTUNITY TO COME
TO THE UNITED STATES IN 100
YEARS. NOW DONALD TRUMP ON THE OTHER HAND DOES NOT BELIEVE IN
SCIENCE. HE SAYS, AND AGAIN I QUOTE, "THE CONCEPT OF GLOBAL WARMING WAS CREATED BY AND FOR THE CHINESE." I WILL TELL YOU WHAT. IF THE CHINESE WERE REALLY
CAPABLE OF DESIGNING SOME KIND
OF DIABOLICAL FARCE TO HURT AMERICA, THEY WERE NOT INVENT GLOBAL WARMING.
THEY WOULD INVENT DONALD TRUMP.
[CHEERS] THIS MUCH WE KNOW FOR SURE, DONALD TRUMP HAS BEEN A BULLY
HIS WHOLE LIFE. HERE IS WHAT I LEARNED IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL ON THE
PLAYGROUND. BULLIES ARE REALLY JUST COWARDS
IN DISGUISE. THE AMERICA WE LOVE DOES NOT
ENGAGE IN TORTURE. THE AMERICA WE LOVE DOES NOT BUILD WALLS AND SHAMEFUL FOR-PROFIT PRISONS. THE AMERICA WE LOVE DOES NOT
LOCK UP WOMEN AND CHILDREN IN
DISGRACEFUL IMMIGRANT DETENTION
CAMPS.
[CHEERS] UNLIKE THAT IMMIGRANT-BASHING CARNIVAL BARKER DONALD TRUMP,
HILLARY CLINTON UNDERSTANDS THE
ENDURING SYMBOL OF UNITED STATES
OF AMERICA IS NOT OF OUR WIRE FENCE, IT IS THE STATUE OF
LIBERTY.
[CHEERS] AND SO MY FELLOW DEMOCRATS, ANGER AND FEAR HAD THEIR MOMENT LAST WEEK. BUT NOW IT IS OUR TIME.
TIME TO STAND UP FOR EACH OTHER,
STAND UP FOR OUR SHARED PROMISE, STAND UP FOR THE GOODNESS AND THE HOPE IN EVERY AMERICAN
HEART. IT IS TIME TO PUT A BULLY RACIST
IN HIS PLACE AND A TOUGH WOMAN
IN HERS.
THE WHITE HOUSE. HILLARY CLINTON. TIM KAINE. STRONGER TOGETHER. THE COUNTRY WE CARRY IN OUR HEARTS IS WAITING.

[CHEERS]<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> AND AS AN AMERICAN, I'M ALSO DEEPLY CONCERNED ABOUT MY FAMILY'S FUTURE. ABOUT OUR SHARED FUTURE AS A
NATION. BECAUSE THAT FUTURE IS AT RISK. YOU SEE, WHEN WE TALK ABOUT GREENHOUSE GASES AND WARMING TEMPERATURES, EVEN MORE DESTRUCTIVE STORMS, WHAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT IS PEOPLE. THE PEOPLE WE ARE GOING TO SEE IN A FEW MOMENTS, PEOPLE WHOSE
LIVES ARE AFFECTED BY CLIMATE CHANGE RIGHT HERE IN AMERICA,
RIGHT NOW. LIKE A RANCHER IN TEXAS WHO IS LOSING HIS HERD OF CATTLE
BECAUSE THERE IS NO GRASS FOR
THEM TO EAT. OR A FARMER IN KANSAS WHOSE
CROPS ARE DYING BECAUSE THERE IS
NO RAIN. OR, MY FELLOW NEW YORKERS, AND
MOM IN NEW YORK CITY WHO LOST HER YOUNG DAUGHTER AND A FLOOD
MADE FAR WORSE BY RISING TWO
LEVELS. CAN DONALD TRUMP BUT THESE
PEOPLE IN THE EYES AND TELL THEM
CLIMATE CHANGE IS A HOAX? AND THAT THERE IS NOTHING WE CAN
DO? AND HE DOES NOT CARE ABOUT THEIR PAIN. THIS IS A MOMENT WHEN WE AS A NATION HAVE TO DECIDE WHETHER WE WILL IGNORE THE FACTS AND ALLOW PEOPLE TO CONTINUE TO SUFFER, OR
WHETHER WE WILL COME TOGETHER TO DO WHAT IS RIGHT BECAUSE AS WE ALL KNOW, WHEN AMERICANS COME TOGETHER, THERE IS NOTHING WE CAN'T ACCOMPLISH.
[CHEERS] HILLARY CLINTON, SHE GETS IT. SHE CARES.
SHE IS COMMITTED. SHE UNDERSTANDS THAT TAKING A
STAND AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE IS
NOT ABOUT POLITICS, IT IS ABOUT OUR MORAL OBLIGATION TO ONE ANOTHER, AND TO OUR CHILDREN. AND TO THE GENERATIONS THAT WILL
ONE DAY INHERIT THIS BEAUTIFUL EARTH.

<strong>Jerry Brown Jr.</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> THANK YOU.
[CHEERS] THANK YOU. AS WE JUST SAW --
[CHEERS] I ONLY HAVE FIVE MINUTES. I HAVE TO GET GOING. AS WE JUST SAW, CLIMATE CHANGE
IS UNLIKE ANY<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> OTHER THREAT. IT IS OVERARCHING. AFFECT THE ENTIRE EARTH AND ALL LIVING THINGS. IT IS SLOW. IT CAN RECENT IRREVERSIBLE TIPPING POINT AND THE VAST
UNKNOWN SPIRIT COMBATING CLIMATE
CHANGE, THE EXISTENTIAL THREAT
OF OUR TIME WILL TAKE A ROAD EFFORTS ON THE PART OF MANY
PEOPLE IN MANY NATIONS. MAKE NO MISTAKE, CLIMATE CHANGE
IS REAL. THE VAST MAJORITY OF WORLD LEADERS AND CLIMATE SCIENTISTS, LIKE THOSE AT NASA AND THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE, AND BECOME ALL MOST ANYONE WHO
CHOOSES TO THINK, BELIEVE IN THE SCIENCE CLIMATE CHANGE AND SEE
THE MORAL IMPERATIVE TO TAKE
ACTION.
[CHEERS] BUT YOU WOULD NOT KNOW IT BY
LISTENING TO DONALD TRUMP. LASTLY, AT THE REPUBLICAN CONVENTION, FOR 76 LONG AND PAINFUL MINUTES, TRUMP CONJURED
UP A HOST OF DARK THREATS, BUT
NEVER ONCE MENTIONED THE WORD CLIMATE CHANGE OR GLOBAL
WARMING.
WHAT DO YOU EXPECT? DONALD TRUMP REPRESENTED PARTY
WITH OFFICIALS WHO HAVE BANNED
STATE EMPLOYEES FROM EVEN USING
THOSE WORDS IN FLORIDA AND WHO
ELSE KNOWS WHERE ELSE. DONALD TRUMP SAYS GLOBAL WARMING IS A HOAX. I SAID, TRUMP IS A FRAUD.
[CHEERS] TRUMP SAYS THERE IS NO -- CALIFORNIA. I SAID DONALD TRUMP LIES.
[CHEERS] IT IS NOT SURPRISING THAT DONALD
TRUMP CHOSE AS HIS RUNNING MATE
A MAN WHO DENIES THERE IS SUCH A
THING AS EVOLUTION. REALLY? IN AMERICAN HISTORY, HAVE TWO PARTIES TO BURST SO PROFOUNDLY. EVEN THE KNOW NOTHINGS, ANTI-IMMIGRANT PARTY OF THE
AGING HUNDREDS -- 1850'S DID NOT
STRAY AS FAR INTO SHEER IGNORANCE AND DARK FANTASY AS
HAVE THE REPUBLICAN AND A LEADER
DONALD TRUMP.
[CHEERS] OUR CANDIDATE, HILLARY CLINTON COULD NOT BE MORE DIFFERENT. WHILE TRUMP TALKS AND TALKS AND TALKS, HILLARY JUST UPGRADED SHE BITES FOR US ON THE BIG ISSUES. AS SECRETARY OF STATE, SHE PAVED
THE WAY FOR THE HISTORIC PARIS
CLIMATE AGREEMENT, AN AGREEMENT WITH 200 NATIONS, INCLUDING
CHINA AND INDIA ENTHUSIASTICALLY EMBRACING IT. AND MR. TRUMP, HE SAYS THE WORLD BE DAMNED. I'M TURNED IT UP. HILLARY IS THE ONE WHO LAUNCHED
THE CLIMATE AND CLEAN AIR
COALITION.
A GROUP OF NATIONS TAKING ACTION
TO REDUCE BLACK CARBON AND OTHER
SUPER CLIMATE POLLUTANTS WHICH
CAUSED SEVERE HEART AND LUNG
DAMAGE. AND FOR HER BIRTHDAY IN OFFICE, PRESIDENT HILLARY CLINTON WILL
DO WHAT IS NEEDED TO COMBAT CLIMATE CHANGE AND LEAD THE CLEAN ENERGY REVOLUTION.
AND YES, WE DO NEED A
REVOLUTION.
[CHEERS] AND WE WILL GET ONE. WE KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT THAT IN CALIFORNIA.
[CHEERS] WE CAPS ON PANELS, CLEAN OMISSIONS, AND ATTACKS ARE
COMMON. WE'RE PROVEN WITH THE TOUGHEST CLIMATE LAWS ON THE COUNTRY, OUR ECONOMY IS GROWING FASTER THAN ALMOST ANY NATION IN THE WHOLE WORLD.
[CHEERS] MR. TRUMP, AND THOSE WHO LIVED
IN CLIMATE DENIAL SAY OTHERWISE. THEY TELL US WE HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN THE ECONOMY AND SAVING THE PLANET. DONALD TRUMP AND THE CLIMATE
DENIERS ARE DEAD WRONG. DANGEROUSLY WRONG. WHAT AMERICA NEEDS TODAY ARE NOT DENIERS, THAT LEADERS. NOT THE VISION, A COMMON PURPOSE. NOT BOMBAST, BUT BOLD ACTION. THAT IS WHY WE NEED HILLARY. THAT IS WHY THE AMERICAN PEOPLE
WHO CHOOSE HER AS THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. THANK YOU.

-- SO MANY LIVES. I'M GLAD COMMONSENSE GUN POLICY
WAS IN PLACE THE DAY HE WAS BORN.

THE MIND ALTERING PARALYZING SORRY THAT COMES WITH LOSING A CHILD TO GET VIOLENCE.
IT IS FUNDAMENTAL. ONLY THOSE WHO LIVE IT KNOW IT. IN NEWTOWN, FAMILIES OF 21ST

-- SIX TEACHERS LIVE WITH IT
EVERY MINUTE OF EVERY DAY.
ACROSS THE COUNTRY, UNBELIEVABLY, 90 FAMILIES JOINED
THEM. MY OLDER SON IS THE SAME AGE AT THOSE KIDS IN SANDY HOOK.
SHE JUST FINISHED FIRST GRADE. MY WIFE AND I ARE THE SAME AGE
AS THE PARENTS. I AM FURIOUS. I AM CURIOUS -- FURIOUS THAT IN THREE YEARS, THREE YEARS OF
ALMOST DAILY BLOODSHED IN THE
CITIES, THE REPUBLICAN CONGRESS
HAS DONE ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO
PREVENT THE NEXT MASSACRE.
>> BOO!
>> A SENSE OF OUTRAGE THAT I'VE
NEVER FELT BEFORE. THAT WHAT -- IS WHAT DROVE ME TO
STAND ON THE FLOOR OF THE UNITED
STATES SENATE TO DEMAND CHANGE FOR 15 HOURS.
[CHEERS] I'M HERE TODAY BECAUSE I WANT A PRESIDENT WHO SHARES THAT SAME
SENSE OF OUTRAGE. OUTRAGE THAT THE GUN LOBBY
FIGHTS TO KEEP OPEN GLARING LOOPHOLES THAT 90% OF AMERICANS WANT CLOSED. IF A SUPPLY -- SUSPECTED
TERRORIST CAN WALK INTO A GUN
STORE AND WALK OUT WITH A
MILITARY STYLE SEMIAUTOMATIC
WEAPON, HILLARY CLINTON NOT HAVE TO MAKE FIGHTING TO BALANCE A
CENTERPIECE OF HER CAMPAIGN, I'M SURE PEOPLE TOLD HER IT WAS NOT
WORTH THE POLITICAL RISK, BUT SHE HELD FIRM. SHE STOOD UP TO THE NRA AND HILLARY CLINTON PLEDGED TO TAKE WASHINGTON BACK FROM THE GUN
LOBBY.
[CHEERS] DONALD TRUMP, WHEN HE SEES GUN
VIOLENCE DEVASTATING OUR
COMMUNITIES, IT IS JUST LIKE
EVERYTHING ELSE.
HE SEES IT AS AN OPPORTUNITY. ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY TO CONVINCE AMERICANS THAT THEY SHOULD FEAR
ONE ANOTHER. ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY TO DO THE BAITING OF THE GUN LOBBY. 90% OF AMERICANS WANT THE
BACKGROUND CHECK SYSTEM EXPANDED
TO COVER MORE GUN SALES SO
DANGEROUS WEAPONS DON'T FALL
INTO THE WRONG HANDS.
BUT DONALD TRUMP SAYS IN HIS
FIRST HOUR IN THE OVAL OFFICE,
HE WILL ROLLBACK SAFEGUARDS WE ALREADY HAVE AN EVEN MORE
SINISTER, HE SAID BY THE END OF
HIS FIRST DAY IN OFFICE, HE WILL
MANDATE THAT EVERY SCHOOL IN AMERICA ALLOWS GUNS IN THE
CLASSROOM. THINK ABOUT THAT FOR A MOMENT. OF ALL THE THINGS THAT DONALD TRUMP IN A PROMISED TO DO ON HIS
FIRST DAY OF OFFICE, HE CHOSE WEAKENING BACKGROUND CHECKS AND
PUTTING GUNS IN ELEMENTARY
SCHOOL. THIS IS A FATE WE CANNOT ACCEPT. MY FRIENDS, THERE IS NO REASON
TO FEEL HELPLESS ABOUT THE HORRIFYING TRAJECTORY CASCADING
MASSACRES.
WE CAN CHANGE THIS. SMART GUN POLICY LIKE BACKGROUND
CHECKS COME IT CAN MAKE THIS
COUNTRY SAFER.
I STOOD ON THE FLOOR OF THE
UNITED STATES SENATE FOR 15 HOURS BECAUSE I HAD HAD ENOUGH. ENOUGH OF CHILDREN DYING IN OUR CLASSROOMS.
[CHEERS] ENOUGH OF THE NIGHTLY BLOODSHED
ON THE CITY STREETS. ENOUGH OF POLICE OFFICERS BEING OUTGUNNED, AMBUSHED AND CUT DOWN
IN THE LINE OF DUTY. I'VE HAD ENOUGH.
[CHEERS] AND FRIENDS, IT IS TIME TO TAKE WASHINGTON BACK FROM THE GUN
LOBBY.
[CHEERS] AND I KNOW JUST HOW TO DO IT.
I WANT YOU TO START, I WANT YOU
TO START BY TEXTING THE WORD
LAW. YOU WILL TURN YOURSELF INTO AN
ACTIVIST AND THEN, YOU WILL GO
AND ELECT HILLARY CLINTON AS THE
NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. SHE IS A LEADER WHO HAVE THE
EMPATHY AND THE GUTS TO DECLARE WITH EVERY FIBER IN HER BEING THAT WE HAVE HAD ENOUGH.

POLICE OFFICERS KILLED IN THE
LINE OF DUTY.<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> AFTER THE ATTACKS ON POLICE AND
POLICE -- IN DALLAS AND BATON ROUGE, THE ENTIRE NATION MOURNED
IT MORE.
-- 8 MORE.
AFTER 47 YEARS IN LAW ENFORCEMENT AND CHICAGO, WASHINGTON, DC AND PHILADELPHIA, I'VE MOURNED FAR TOO MANY OFFICERS KILLED BY GUNS. AS A NATION, WE'VE MOURNED FAR TOO MANY INNOCENT PEOPLE THAT
HAVE FALLEN VICTIM TO GUN
VIOLENCE.
I'M HERE TO SAY WE NEED MORE
THAN GREETING TO PROTECT OUR LAW
ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS.
AND TO SERVE THE MEMORY OF THOSE
HEROES WHO HAVE FOLLOWED. WE NEED COMMONSENSE MEASURES TO
REDUCE GUN VIOLENCE.
[CHEERS] POLICE NEED THESE COMMONSENSE MEASURES AND A LEADER WHO WILL
FIGHT FOR THEM.
I GREW UP IN THE ENGLEWOOD
NEIGHBORHOOD ON THE SOUTH SIDE
OF CHICAGO.
[CHEERS] THE HAZE OF GUN VIOLENCE HANGS
HEAVY THERE. MY MOTHER'S -- BROTHER'S BEST
FRIEND WAS MURDERED NOT 50 FEET
FROM OUR HOUSE. HE HAD REFUSED TO JOIN A GANG. A FEW YEARS LATER, IN THAT SAME LOCATION, A CHICAGO POLICE OFFICER WAS SHOT DEAD IN ALMOST THE SAME SPOT. HE HAD BEEN FILLING OUT THE
REPORT AND WAS MURDERED BY
THREE GANG MEMBERS. GUN VIOLENCE IS NOT UNIQUE. IT CONTINUES TO VISIT NEIGHBORHOODS ACROSS THE UNITED STATES. DURING MY YEARS IN POLICING, I
HAVE SEEN THE CRIMES, I'VE SEEN THE GRIEVING FAMILIES INCLUDING FAMILIES OF POLICE OFFICERS. I'VE SEEN THE COST OF GUN
VIOLENCE. NOW, MORE THAN EVER, WE NEED A STRONG LEADER TO STOP THE BLOODSHED.
[CHEERS] A LEADER THAT WILL PROTECT OUR OFFICERS FROM BEING OUTGUNNED BY WEAPONS OF FOUR. AND TO REBUILD THE BOND BETWEEN
POLICE AND COMMUNITIES.
[CHEERS] THAT IS WHY I'M WITH HILLARY
CLINTON.
[CHEERS] HILLARY CLINTON IS A STRONG
LEADER. TO PROTECT OUR COPS AND COMMITTEE FROM GUN VIOLENCE.
SHE HAS STOOD WITH OUR FIRST
RESPONDERS WHEN WE NEEDED HER
MOST IN THE DAYS AFTER 9/11 TO MAKE SURE THEY GOT THE BENEFIT
THEY HAD EARNED AND TODAY, SHE SUPPORTS COMPREHENSIVE BACKGROUND CHECKS AND THE
ASSAULT WEAPONS BANS.
[CHEERS] THOSE WHO AIM TO DO HARM SHOULD
NOT GET A HANDGUN, LET ALONE AN
ASSAULT RIFLE.
[CHEERS] HILLARY CLINTON IS THE STUDY LEADER TO SHEPHERD US THROUGH
THIS CRITICAL TIME. THE BONDS BETWEEN LAW ENFORCEMENT AND COMMUNITIES ARE AFRAID.
-- FRAYED. WE NEED TO CHAMPION OUR GREATEST HOPES. HILLARY WILL. SHE WILL BRING POLICE AND COMMUNITIES CLOSER TOGETHER. SHE WILL SUPPORT THOSE WHO FEEL FORGOTTEN. AREAS LIKE CHICAGO AND SOUTHEAST
DCN NORTH PHILADELPHIA. SHE WILL SUPPORT DEDICATED POLICE OFFICERS WORKING TO IMPROVE THEIR COMMUNITIES. IMPORTANT AS EVER, HILLARY CLINTON WILL BUILD BRIDGES BETWEEN COMMUNITIES AND POLICE. AND LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THAT
IS BETTER THAN BUILDING WALLS.
[CHEERS] HILLARY CLINTON IS THE RIGHT
PERSON TO BECOME THE 45TH
PRESIDENT OF UNITED STATES OF
AMERICA.
[CHEERS] SHE WILL WORK TO STRENGTHEN THE
BONDS OF TRUMP AND POLICE IN THE COMMUNITY THEY SERVE.
THAT IS WHY SHE HAS MY VOTE.
[CHEERS] MAY GOD BLESS ALL OF YOU, MAY GOD BLESS THE MEN AND WOMEN OF
LAW ENFORCEMENT AND MAY GOD
BLESS THE UNITED STATES OF
AMERICA.
[CHEERS] THANK YOU.

WE HAVE TO DO THAT. THERE ARE DAYS WHEN IT FEELS
LIKE OUR BODIES AND OUR MINDS
ARE UNDER TOO MUCH PRESSURE. THEN I REMEMBER THAT WE HAVE -- I THINK GOD THAT OUR SOULS ARE
ON FIRE. I VISITED CHARLESTON THIS YEAR.
I CAN TELL YOU THAT THAT CITY'S SOUL IS ON FIRE. THAT SOUL BURNS WITH RESILIENCE.
IT FUELS THE RESISTANCE. IT BROUGHT DOWN THE CONFEDERATE FLAG --
[CHEERS] AND IT BRINGS THE TRUSTING COMMUNITY TOGETHER CLOSER

[CHEERS] IT IS SO GREAT TO BE HERE IN THE
GREAT CITY OF PHILADELPHIA. I SPEAK YOU TONIGHT AS A PROUD SON OF TWO NEW JERSEY<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> POLICE
OFFICERS.
[CHEERS] AS A VETERAN OF 39, MISSIONS DURING OPERATION DESERT STORM, AND OF 25 YEARS IN THE UNITED STATES NAVY --
[CHEERS] AS A FORMER NASA ASTRONAUT WHO
FLEW FOR MISSIONS INTO SPACE, MY DECADES AS A PILOT A MILITARY
OFFICER AND ASTRONAUT GAVE ME A UNIQUE PERSPECTIVE ON OUR WORLD. I SAW OUR COUNTRY AT ITS BEST.
I ALSO SAW IT, HUMANITY, AT ITS WORST.
FROM THE COCKPIT OF MY BASICS INTRUDER -- A-6 INTRUDER, I SAW
AMERICA LEAD THE INTERNATIONAL COALITION THAT DEFEATED SADDAM
HUSSEIN. I ALSO SAW THE DEVASTATING
EFFECTS OF WAR ITSELF. FROM ORBIT, I SAW OUR PLANET AS A PERFECT BLUE MARBLE JUST LOADING IN THE BLACKNESS OF
SPACE.
-- FLOATING IN THE BLACKNESS OF
SPACE. I ALSO SAW A RECEDING GLACIERS AND SHRINKING RAINFORESTS.
AT WAR AND SPACE, I SAW THE AWESOME EXTENT OF AMERICAN POWER
AND CAPABILITY. BUT IT WAS SO FRUSTRATING TO RETURN HOME AND SEE HOW WE STRUGGLE TO ADDRESS SOME OF OUR GREATEST CHALLENGES. JUST AS HILLARY IS PREPARED TO DO THE ISIS, ADVANCE OUR VALUES, AND PROTECT OUR FREEDOMS, HILLARY IS READY TO TAKE ON ONE
OF OUR COUNTRIES GREATEST MORAL FAILURES HERE AT HOME, AND THAT IS THE GUN VIOLENCE THAT IS TEARING SO MANY OF OUR
COMMUNITIES APART.
[CHEERS] WE HAVE TO DO BETTER. AND HILLARY KNOWS WE CAN. HILLARY KNOWS THAT WE CAN SAVE
LIVES BY DOING MORE TO KEEP GUNS
OUT OF THE WRONG HANDS. AND WE KNOW THAT AS PRESIDENT,
SHE WILL DO WHAT IS RIGHT FOR OUR NATION, NOT WHAT IS
POLITICALLY CORRECT -- POLITICALLY EXPEDIENT.
[CHEERS] SHE WAS DEAD UP TO THE
WASHINGTON GUN LOBBY THAT WORKS TO PROTECT THE SHAMEFUL STATUS QUO. IF WE WANT TO LEAVE OUR KIDS AND
GRANDKIDS A COUNTRY WITH LESS GUN VIOLENCE, NOT MORE, THEN WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT HILLARY
CLINTON IS OUR NEXT PRESIDENT.
[CHEERS] NOW, I WANT TO INTRODUCE YOU TO SOMEBODY WHO IS WORKING TO DO
JUST THAT.
SOMEBODY WHO HAS TAUGHT ME EACH
AND EVERY DAY TO DENY THEY
SENTENCE OF FAILURE, SOMEBODY
WHO DOES NOT GIVE UP AND
SOMEBODY WHO BELIEVES, LIKE HILLARY DOES THAT WE ARE STRONGER TOGETHER. MY WIFE, MY WIFE THE AWESOME CONGRESSWOMAN DEBBIE GIFFORDS.

<strong>John D. Hutson</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> THANK YOU. GOOD EVENING. MY NAME IS JOHN HUDSON. UNLIKE DONALD TRUMP, THERE ARE TWO THINGS THAT I KNOW AN AWFUL
LOT ABOUT. LAW AND ORDER.
[CHEERS]<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> FOR 11 YEARS, I WAS A LAW SCHOOL DEAN.
FOR 30 YEARS I SERVED PROUDLY IN THE UNITED STATES NAVY INCLUDING AS THE JUDGE ADVOCATE GENERAL.
[CHEERS] GO NAVY.
[CHEERS] DONALD TRUMP CALLS HIMSELF THE
LAW AND ORDER CANDIDATE. BUT HE WILL HIGHLIGHT INTERNATIONAL LAW.
IN HIS WORD, HE ENDORSES TORTURE
AT A MINIMUM. HE WILL ORDER OUR TROOPS TO
COMMIT WAR CRIMES LIKE KILLING
CIVILIANS AND ASK THEY SAID YOU
HAVE TO TAKE OUT THEIR FAMILIES. WHAT DID HE SAY WHEN HE WAS TOLD
THAT WAS ILLEGAL? HE SAID, OUR TROOPS WILL NOT
REFUSE. BELIEVE ME. THIS MORNING, THIS VERY MORNING, HE PERSONALLY INVITED RUSSIA TO
HACK US.
>> BOO! THAT IS NOT LAW AND ORDER. THAT IS CRIMINAL INTENT.
[CHEERS] DONALD TRUMP WOULD ABANDON OUR ALLIES AND LET MORE COUNTRIES
GET NUCLEAR WEAPONS. HE LIED ABOUT DONATING TO
VETERANS. AND HE CALLED THE MILITARY THAT
I SERVED IN A DISASTER. IT IS EMBARRASSING ENOUGH THAT
HE IS THE FACE OF ONE OF OUR
POLITICAL PARTIES. THE REAL DISASTER WOULD BE IF WE
LET DONALD TRUMP BECOME THE FACE OF THE COUNTRY THAT WE LOVE.
[CHEERS] MORE THAN 120 REPUBLICANS,
NATIONAL SECURITY LEADERS,
REPUBLICAN NATIONAL SECURITY LEADERS RECENTLY WARNED THAT
DONALD TRUMP WOULD, IN THEIR WORDS, MAKE AMERICA LESS SAFE. HE EVEN MOCKED POWS LIKE JOHN MCCAIN. I SERVED IN THE SAME NAVY AS
JOHN MCCAIN. I USED TO VOTE IN THE SAME PARTY
AS JOHN MCCAIN. DONALD, YOU ARE NOT FIT TO POLISH JOHN MCCAIN'S BOOTS.
[CHEERS] BUT, AMERICA, WE HAVE A BETTER
CHOICE. HILLARY CLINTON IS THE ONLY
CANDIDATE WHO KNOWS HOW TO WORK
WITH OUR ALLIES, WHO HAS A SPECIFIC PLAN TO DEFEAT ISIS,
SHE IS SMART AND A STEADY.
SHE HAS THE EXPERIENCE, THE TEMPERAMENT AND THE SPINE TO BE
A SUPERB COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF.
[CHEERS] SHE KNOWS WHAT MAKES US BE ENVY
OF THE WORLD.
NOT OUR ABUNDANT NATURAL
RESOURCES OR OUR RESILIENT ECONOMY, OR EVEN THAT WE HAVE THE STRONGEST MILITARY HONORS, OUR STRENGTH COMES FROM WHO WE ARE AND WHO WE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN. OUR COMMUNITY.
-- HUMANITY.
[CHEERS] IF WE LOSE OUR HUMANITY, WE LOSE THE BATTLE AND THE WAR. ISIS AND OTHER RADICAL GROUPS
HAVE NO HUMANITY. THAT IS THEIR WEAKEST -- WEAKNESS. OUR ENEMY CANNOT DEFEAT US
MILITARILY. VICTORY FOR THEM WILL NOT BE FOUND ON THE BATTLEFIELD. FOR THEM, VICTOR IS TO MAKE US
-- VICTORY IS TO MAKE US MORE
LIKE THEM. PEOPLE WHO TORTURE. PEOPLE WHO DO STABILIZE THE
INTERNATIONAL ORDER.
WHO TARGET INNOCENTS BECAUSE THEY DO NOT LOOK OR PRAY LIKE THEM. DONALD TRUMP IS A WALKING, TALKING, RECRUITING POSTER FOR
TERRORISTS.
[CHEERS] THAT IS NOT HYPERBOLE. ISIS LITERALLY USED TRUMP IN A
COMMERCIAL. YOU CAN TELL A LOT A PERSON -- ABOUT A PERSON BY WHO THEY ADMIRE.
ELEANOR ROOSEVELT.
NELSON MANDELA. DOROTHY RODHAM. THESE ARE HILLARY CLINTON'S
HEROES. DONALD TRUMP: DONALD TRUMP
ADMIRES DONALD TRUMP. AND SADDAM HUSSEIN AND KIM JONG-IL AND AND -- VLADIMIR PUTIN, HE SAYS IN TERMS OF LEADERSHIP, HE IS GETTING AN A.
>> BOO.
>> I TAUGHT NATIONAL SECURITY LAW. PRAISING DICTATORS WAS AN AUTOMATIC PATH -- F IN MY CLASS.
[CHEERS] LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING, IN 2008, AT THE DEAN OF THE
UNIVERSITY OF NEW HAMPSHIRE
SCHOOL OF LAW, I INVITED EACH PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE TO TALK ABOUT TERRORISM. TO TALK ABOUT TERRORISM WITH ME
AND OTHER RETIRED ADMIRALS AND
GENERALS. OF ALL THE CANDIDATES WE MET WITH, HILLARY CLINTON WAS BY FAR
THE BEST PREPARED AND MOST
KNOWLEDGEABLE. SHE LISTEN CAREFULLY TO OUR ARGUMENTS. SHE TESTED US.
WE HAD MORE THAN 500 YEARS OF COLLECTIVE EXPERIENCE AND WE
LEARNED FROM HER. THIS IS BEFORE SHE SERVED AS OUR
SECRETARY OF STATE. BEFORE SHE BROKERED A PEACE FIRE IN GAZA.
BEFORE SHE RALLIED THE WORLD TO SECTION IRAN -- SANCTION IRAN AND ADVISED OBAMA TO TAKE OUT
OSAMA BIN LADEN.
AND SHE RESTORED OUR REPUTATION
IN THE WORLD.
[CHEERS] ANYONE WHO SERVED WITH THE YOUNG
MEN AND WOMEN IN OUR ARMED
FORCES KNOWS HOW SERIOUS IT IS
TO SEND THEM TO HARM'S WAY. WHEN YOU ARE A SOLDIER, SERMON
-- SAILOR, RING, HE DON'T GET TO
CHOOSE YOUR COMMANDERS. WHEN YOU ARE A CITIZEN, TO HAVE
THE RESPONSIBILITY TO CHOOSE A COMMANDER WHO WILL KEEP US SAFE, STRONG, AND SECURE. CHOOSE HILLARY.
[CHEERS] THANK YOU.
[CHEERS]

CALIFORNIA.

<strong>Kirsten Kavanaugh</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> AT THE AGE OF 24, I DEPLOYED
TO IRAQ. IT IS VERY RECEIVED DIRECT FIRE.
AFTER EACH ATTACK, EVERYTHING
WOULD FALL SILENT. AND THEN, I WOULD HEAR THE
SOUNDS<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> OF THE ARTILLERY BATTERY
RETURNING FIRE. AND THE QUICK REACTION FORCE
HELICOPTERS TAKING OFF IN THE
ENEMY DIRECTION. AS A YOUNG MARINE LIEUTENANT IN A NON-COMBAT POSITION, THESE UNITS, ALONG WITH SPECIAL OPERATIONS TEAMS AND GREEN INFANTRY BATTALIONS STATIONED WITH US -- MARINE INFANTRY
BETIMES STATION WITH US FOR THE
FIRST LINE OF DEFENSE.
I GAVE THEM MY LIFE.
I TRUSTED THEM AND MY COMMANDERS TO HAVE THE RIGHT STRATEGY. I TRUSTED THAT WE WERE INVITED EITHER -- EVEN WHEN THE ENEMY
CHOSE NOT TO. THAT TRUST STARTS AT THE TOP OF
THE CHAIN OF COMMAND. AND I TRUST HILLARY CLINTON TO
BE COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF.
[CHEERS] HE UNDERSTANDS THE IMPORTANCE OF A STRONG MILITARY AND DIPLOMACY. SHE KNOWS WE ARE STRONGER WHEN
WE WORK WITH OUR ALLIES TO KEEP
US SAFE. SHE HAS THE EXPERIENCE, TEMPERAMENT, AND STEADY HAND TO
LEAD. I DO NOT TRUST DONALD TRUMP.
[CHEERS] THE MILITARY IS DEFINED BY
DISCIPLINE. LEADERSHIP. INTEGRITY. THOSE ARE THE QUALITIES THAT DREW ME TO SERVE. AND THOSE OF THE VERY QUALITIES
THAT DONALD TRUMP LACKS.
[CHEERS] HE SUGGESTS ABANDONING OUR
CLOSEST ALLIES. HE PRAISES DICTATORS WHO KILLED
AMERICANS. HE SAYS WE SHOULD ALLOW MORE COUNTRIES TO GET NUCLEAR
WEAPONS. HIS RECKLESSNESS MEANS MORE
DEPLOYMENT FOR MY FRIENDS. MORE FAMILIES SEPARATED. AND MORE YOUNG HEROES NEVER
COMING HOME. WHEN HE SAYS HE WOULD EXPAND TORTURE, KILL CIVILIANS, OR
FORCE THE MILITARY TO COMMIT WAR CRIMES, HE IS DEFINING THE
VALUES -- DEFINED VIA THAT EVERY
SERVICE MEMBER IS TAUGHT ON DAY ONE.
-- DEFYING THE VALUES EVERY
MILITARY SERVICE MEMBER IS
TAUGHT ON DAY ONE.
HE DEVISED THE BUYERS WE RISK -- DEFIES THE VALUES WE RISK TO
DEFEND. THIS ELECTION IS NOT JUST ABOUT DONALD TRUMP'S JUDGMENT. IT IS ABOUT OUR OWN.
[CHEERS] OUR TROOPS, OUR NATION, OUR
WORLD CANNOT AFFORD FOR US TO
GET THIS WRONG.

<strong>Leon E. Panetta</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> AT THIS HOUR, AND SOME VERY
DANGEROUS CORNERS OF THE WORLD, YOUNG AMERICANS ARE STANDING GUARD. OUR BRAVE MILITARY AND INTELLIGENCE PROFESSIONALS ARE<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> ON THE FRONT LINES FAR FROM HOME. RISKING THEIR LIVES FOR US, FOR OUR FREEDOM, OUR WAY OF LIFE. THE PRESIDENT, A COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF, HAS NO GREATER RESPONSIBILITY, NO GREATER RESPONSIBILITY THAN THE
DECISION TO SEND OUR TROOPS INTO
HARM'S WAY.
[CHEERS] I HAVE WORKED ALONGSIDE
NON-PRESIDENTS. REPUBLICAN AND DEMOCRAT. ALL EXPERIENCED, ALL BELIEVING
IN THE U.S. ROLE IN WORLD
LEADERSHIP. I CAN PAY THIS, THAT IN THIS ELECTION, THERE IS ONLY ONE
CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT WHO HAS
THE EXPERIENCE, THE TEMPERAMENT
AND THE JUDGMENT TO BE COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF AND THAT IS
HILLARY CLINTON.
[CHEERS] THIS IS NO TIME, THIS IS NO TIME TO GAMBLE WITH OUR FUTURE. AMERICA FACES FLASHPOINTS AND THREATS FROM AROUND THE GLOBE. WE NEED A PRESIDENT WHO IS STRONG AND SMART ENCOURAGES, WHO ENTERS THE OVAL OFFICE WITH THE RESPECT OF THE GENERALS AND
ADMIRALS WHO LEAD THE MILITARY. WITH THE CONFIDENCE OF DIPLOMATS WHO REPRESENT AMERICA AND WITH
THE TRUST OF OUR TROOPS WHO KNOW
THAT SHE WILL ALWAYS HAVE THEIR BACK.
[CHEERS] THAT PRESIDENT IS HILLARY CLINTON.
[CHEERS] DURING MY TIME AS CIA DIRECTOR, AND SECRETARY OF DEFENSE,
HILLARY WAS A STRONG SUPPORTER OF OUR EFFORTS TO PROTECT OUR HOMELAND. TO DECIMATE AL QAEDA AND TO BRING OSAMA BIN LADEN TO
JUSTICE.
[CHEERS] AND THE TOUGH DECISIONS, TO GO
AFTER BIN LADEN, LONG MEETINGS
IN THE WHITE HOUSE. WE DELAYED THAT FATEFUL DECISION
. I PRESENTED THE INTELLIGENCE TO
THE PRESIDENT AND TO OTHERS
WEIGHING OUT THE RISKS OF THE
OPERATION. AND WHEN THE PRESIDENT WENT
AROUND THE TABLE, TO OUR COUNTRY. SECURITY LEADERSHIP, THERE WERE CONCERNS. BUT HILLARY WAS CLEAR. WE HAVE TO GO AFTER BIN LADEN.
[CHEERS] AND OUR SPECIAL OPERATIONS FORCES, GOD BLESS THEM, THEY JUST THAT. AND THEY SENT A CLEAR MESSAGE TO THE WORLD, NO ONE ATTACKED THE
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AND
GETS AWAY WITH IT.
[CHEERS] HILLARY IS JUST AS DETERMINED TO
DEFEAT THOSE WHO THREATEN US TODAY. ISIS, AL QAEDA, BOKO HARAM, AL-SHABAAB, TERRORISTS WHO
PERVERT THE TEACHINGS OF ISLAM
TO KILL INNOCENT PEOPLE GOING
ABOUT THEIR DAILY LIVES. PEOPLE TRAVELING THROUGH
AIRPORTS IN BRUSSELS AND THE
SCANDAL. FAMILIES CELEBRATING ON THE BEACHFRONT IN FRANCE. AND JUST THIS WEEK, AN 85-YEAR-OLD PRIEST WHOSE THROAT
WAS SLIT BY TERRORISTS WHO
STORMED HIS CHURCH DURING MASS. THESE MURDERERS MUST BE STOPPED.
[CHEERS] HILLARY CLINTON IS THE ONLY CANDIDATE WHO HAS LAID OUT A COMPREHENSIVE FAN -- PLAN TO
DEFEAT AND DESTROY ISIS AND KEEP AMERICA SAFE. SHE IS SMART, PRINCIPAL, SHE IS TOUGH AND SHE IS READY.
[CHEERS] HILLARY CLINTON IS THE SINGLE MOST EXPERIENCED AND PREPARE A PERSON WHO HAS EVER RUN FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.
[CHEERS] MEANWHILE, DONALD TRUMP SAYS HE
GETS HIS FOREIGN-POLICY EXPERIENCE FROM WATCHING TV AND
RUNNING THE MISS UNIVERSE PAGEANT. IF ONLY IT WERE FUNNY, BUT IT IS DEADLY SERIOUS. DONALD TRUMP ASKS OUR TROOPS TO
COMMIT WAR CRIMES, ENDORSES TORTURE, BURNT OUR ALLIES FROM
EUROPE TO ASIA AND SUGGESTS THAT COUNTRIES HAVE NUCLEAR WEAPONS
AND HE PRAISES DICTATORS FROM SADDAM HUSSEIN TO VLADIMIR
PUTIN. TODAY, ONLY TODAY, LET ME POINT
OUT SOMETHING THAT JUST HAPPENED TODAY. DONALD TRUMP TODAY ONCE AGAIN
TOOK RUSSIA'S SIDE. HE ASKED THE RUSSIANS TO INTERFERE IN AMERICAN POLITICS. THINK ABOUT THAT.
>> BOO!
>> THINK ABOUT THAT FOR A
MOMENT. DONALD TRUMP WHO WAS THE
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES IS ASKING ONE OF OUR ADVERSARIES
TO ENGAGE IN HACKING AND
INTELLIGENT EFFORTS AGAINST THE
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA TO
AFFECT AN ELECTION.
>> BOO!
>> AS SOMEONE WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PROTECTING OUR NATION FROM
CYBER ATTACKS, IT IS
INCONCEIVABLE TO ME THAT ANY PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE WOULD BE
THAT IRRESPONSIBLE. I SAY THIS OUT OF THE FIRM CONCERN FOR THE FUTURE OF MY
CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN, DONALD TRUMP CANNOT BECOME COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF.
[CHEERS] IN AN UNSTABLE WORLD, WE CANNOT
AFFORD UNSTABLE LEADERSHIP. WE CANNOT AFFORD SOMEONE WHO
BELIEVES AMERICA SHOULD WITHDRAW
FROM THE WORLD, THREATENS OUR INTERNATIONAL TREATIES AND
VIOLATES OUR MORAL PRINCIPLES. WE CANNOT AFFORD AN ERRATIC
FINGER ON THE NUCLEAR WEAPONS.
[CHEERS] THIS IS NO TIME TO ROLL THE DICE
AND TO GAMBLE WITH AMERICA'S
NATIONAL SECURITY OR WITH THE
AMERICAN DREAM. NO DOUBT. I'VE LIVED THAT AMERICAN DREAM. MY PARENTS WERE IMMIGRANTS OR MENTALLY.
-- ITALY.
THEY CAME FROM ELLIS ISLAND. THEY MADE THEIR WAY TO CALIFORNIA. THEY OPENED A RESTAURANT. I CAN STILL REMEMBER STANDING ON THE CHAIR IN THE BACK OF THAT RESTAURANT WASHING GLASSES. NEVER COULD MY -- COULD I DO
AGREE THAT I WOULD BECOME
SECRETARY OF DEFENSE OF THE MOST
POWERFUL MILITARY IN THE WORLD.
[CHEERS] THE AMERICAN DREAM --
>> USA USA USA. USA! USA! USA!
>> THE AMERICAN DREAM. THE AMERICAN DREAM THAT WE'VE ALL BEEN A PART OF HAS BEEN
APPENDED IN EVERY GENERATION BY
THE BRAVE MEN AND WOMEN WILLING
TO FIGHT AND DIE FOR AMERICA. THEY ARE OUR GREATEST NATIONAL
TREASURES.
[CHEERS] AND THEY DESERVE A SERIOUS COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF. IF WE CARE ABOUT THEM, IF WE
CARE ABOUT OUR SECURITY HIM IF
WE CARE ABOUT OUR FREEDOMS, IF
WE CARE ABOUT THE AMERICAN
DREAM, THERE IS ONLY ONE CHOICE, HILLARY CLINTON FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.
[CHEERS] GOD BLESS YOU AND GOD BLESS OUR NATION.

HE UNDERSTANDS THAT WORKING PEOPLE ARE THE BACKBONE OF THIS
GREAT NATION. AND HE HAS TREMENDOUS EMPATHY
FOR THOSE IN NEED. HE KNOWS, AS I DO, THAT EDUCATION IS THE GREAT EQUALIZER
AND THAT COMMUNITY COLLEGES ARE
AMERICA'S BEST-KEPT SECRET. AND HE BELIEVES, AS I DO, THAT WE HAVE A SPECIAL OBLIGATION TO
OUR MILITARY AND THEIR FAMILIES. HE HAS A DEEP COMMITMENT TO
JUSTICE AND HE HAS BEEN HIS ENTIRE CAREER STANDING UP TO THE
ABUSE OF POWER. HE KNOWS AT ITS BEST, POLITICS IS ALWAYS A MATTER OF THE HEART. AND HE REMAINS TODAY EVEN AFTER ALL HE HAS BEEN THERE -- THROUGH, THE MOST OPTIMISTIC

<strong>Jill Biden</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> THANK YOU. THANK YOU, THANK YOU, THANK YOU. I LOVE YOU.
[CHEERS] LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THANK YOU,
THANK YOU.
[CHEERS] I LOVE YOU. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> EIGHT YEARS AGO, I STOOD ON THE STAGE IN DENVER.
[CHEERS] AND I ACCEPTED YOUR NOMINATION TO BE VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.
[CHEERS] AND EVERY SINGLE DAY SINCE THEN,
IT HAS BEEN THE HONOR OF OUR LIVES FOR JOE AND ME, EVERY DAY
WE HAVE BEEN GRATEFUL FOR BROCK AND MICHELLE -- BARACK AND MICHELLE JOINING THEM ON THE
INCREDIBLE JOURNEY.
[CHEERS] A JOURNEY THAT CAN ONLY HAPPEN IN AMERICA.
[CHEERS] WE NOT ONLY HAVE WORKED TOGETHER, AS IT HAS BECOME
OBVIOUS, WE HAVE BECOME FRIENDS. WE ARE NOW FAMILY.
[CHEERS] WHERE FAMILY.
-- WE ARE FAMILY.
[CHEERS] YOU HAVE ALL SEEN OVER THE LAST EIGHT YEARS WHAT PRESIDENT OBAMA MEANS TO THIS COUNTRY.
[CHEERS] HE IS THE EMBODIMENT OF HONOR, RESOLVE AND CHARACTER. ONE OF THE FINEST PRESIDENTS WE
HAVE EVER HAD.
[CHEERS] THAT IS RIGHT.
[CHEERS] THIS IS A MAN OF CHARACTER.
[CHEERS] HE HAS BECOME A BROTHER TO JILL AND ME.
AND MICHELLE, YOU ARE
INCREDIBLE.
[CHEERS] YOU ARE INCREDIBLE!
[CHEERS] I WAS TALKING TO BROCK TODAY, IT IS NO LONGER HE WILL GIVE THE
BEST SPEECH, WE KNOW WHO DID
THAT.
YOU ARE INCREDIBLE MONDAY NIGHT.
-- WERE INCREDIBLE MONDAY NIGHT.
[CHEERS] THE DELAWARE DELEGATION, AS THEY SAY, BARACK AND I MARRIED WAY UP.
[CHEERS] AS I STAND HERE TONIGHT, I SEE
SO MANY FRIENDS AND COLLEAGUES LIKE MY BUDDY CHRIS DODD FROM THE CONNECTICUT DELEGATION.
SO MANY PEOPLE HERE. I SEE THE FACES OF THOSE WHO
HAVE PLACED THEIR BELIEF IN
BARACK AND ME. SO MANY FACES. BUT ONE, THIS IS KIND OF A BETTER SWEET MOMENT FOR JAIL AND ME AND OUR FAMILY. IN 2008, WHEN HE WAS ABOUT TO DO
PLAY TO A AGAIN IN 2012, OUR SON
THOUGH -- BO INTRODUCED ME TO THE COUNTRY AND PLACE MY NAME
AND NOMINATION. SUSAN: YOU GOT A GLIMPSE OF WHAT
AN INCREDIBLY FINE YOUNG MAN BEAU WAS.
[CHEERS] THANK YOU.
[CHEERS] THANK YOU.
[CHEERS] HIS WIFE AND HIS TWO KIDS ARE
HERE TONIGHT.
[CHEERS] AS ERNEST HEMINGWAY ONCE WROTE,
THE WORLD BREAKS EVERYONE, AND AFTERWARDS, MANY ARE STRONG AT
THE BROKEN PLACES.
I'VE BEEN MADE STRONG AT THE BROKEN PLACES BY MY LOVE WITH JILL, BUT MY HEART AND SON
HUNTER AND THE LOVE OF MY LIFE,
MY ASHLEY. BY ALL OF YOU, AND I MEAN THIS SINCERELY, THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN
THROUGH THIS, YOU KNOW I MEAN
WHAT I SAY, I ALL OF YOU, -- BY
ALL OF YOU, YOUR LOVE AND
PRAYERS AND SUPPORT, YOU KNOW WHAT, WE TALK ABOUT, WE THINK
ABOUT THE COUNTLESS THOUSANDS OF OTHER PEOPLE WHO SUFFERED SO MUCH MORE THAN WE HAVE, WITH SO
MUCH LESS SUPPORT. SO MUCH LESS REASON TO GO ON. BUT THEY GET UP EVERY MORNING, EVERY DAY.
[CHEERS] THEY PUT ONE FOOT IN FRONT OF
THE OTHER, THEY KEEP GOING. THAT IS THE UNBREAKABLE SPIRIT
OF THE PEOPLE OF AMERICA.
[CHEERS] THAT IS WHO WE ARE.
[CHEERS] THAT IS WHO WE ARE. DON'T FORGET IT. LIKE THE PEOPLE OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD THAT JOE AND I GREW
UP, -- JILL AND I GREW UP, THE
KID IN CLAYMONT, THE MOST KURDS ALWAYS JUMPED AND WHEN YOU ARE
DOUBLE TEAMED OR YOUR BACK WAS
AGAINST THE WALL.
BECAME A COP BECAUSE HE ALWAYS
WANTED TO HELP PEOPLE. THE MIDDLE DAUGHTER OF THREE DAUGHTERS, WHO ALWAYS MADE HER MOTHER SMILE, WHO IS A HERO TO
HER SISTERS. NOW I MAJOR IN THE UNITED STATES MARINE CORPS BECAUSE I WANTED TO
SERVE MY COUNTRY.
[CHEERS] THE TEACHERS WHO JILL KNOWS WHO
TAKE MONEY OUT OF THEIR OWN
POCKETS TO BUY PENCILS AND NOTEBOOKS FOR THEIR STUDENTS WHO
CAN'T AFFORD THEM.
[CHEERS] WHY? BECAUSE BEING A TEACHER IS NOT WHAT THEY DO, IT IS WHO THEY ARE
.
[CHEERS] YOU KNOW WHAT I KNOW, FOR REAL. THESE ARE THE PEOPLE THAT THE
HEART AND SOUL OF THIS COUNTRY.
IT IS THE AMERICA THAT I KNOW. THE AMERICA THAT HILLARY KNOWS
AND TIM KAINE KNOWS.
[CHEERS] I'VE KNOWN HILLARY FOR WELL OVER 30 YEARS, BEFORE SHE WAS FIRST LADY OF THE UNITED STATES, WHEN SHE BECAME FIRST LADY, WE SERVED TOGETHER IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE AND DURING HER YEARS AS
SECRETARY OF STATE, ONCE A WEEK
WE HAD BREAKFAST IN MY HOME, THE
VICE PRESIDENT'S RESIDENCE. EVERYBODY KNOWS SHE IS SMART.
EVERYONE KNOWS SHE IS TOUGH. BUT I KNOW WHAT SHE IS
PASSIONATE ABOUT.
[CHEERS] I KNOW HILLARY.
[CHEERS] HILLARY UNDERSTANDS, HILLARY
GETS IT. SHE UNDERSTANDS THE COLLEGE
LOANS ARE ABOUT A LOT MORE THAN GETTING A QUALIFIED STUDENT
EDUCATION. IT IS ABOUT SAVING THE MOM AND
DAD FROM THE INDIGNITY OF HAVING
TO LOOK AT THE CHILD AND
SAY I'M SORRY, THE BANK WOULD
NOT LET US THE MONEY.
I CAN HELP YOU GET TO SCHOOL.
I KNOW THAT ABOUT HILLARY. HILLARY UNDERSTOOD THAT FOR YEARS, MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WENT
TO BED STARING AT THE SCALING -- CEILING THINKING WHAT IF I GET
BREAST CANCER OR HE HAS A HEART
ATTACK?
I WILL LOSE EVERYTHING. WHAT WILL WE DO THEN?
I KNOW ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON.
[CHEERS] LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WE ALL UNDERSTAND WHAT IT WILL MEAN FOR
OUR DAUGHTERS AND GRANDDAUGHTERS
WHEN HILLARY CLINTON WALKS INTO
THE OVAL OFFICE AS PRESIDENT OF
THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.
[CHEERS] IT WILL CHANGE THEIR LIVES.
[CHEERS] MY DAUGHTER AND GRANDDAUGHTERS CAN DO ANYTHING ANY SON OR GRANDSON CAN DO AND SHE WILL PROVE IT, MR. MAYOR.
[CHEERS] LET ME SAY THIS AS CLEARLY AS I CAN, IF YOU LIVE IN THE NEIGHBORHOODS LIKE THE ONES JILL
AND I GREW UP IN, IF YOU WORRY ABOUT YOUR JOB AND GETTING A
DECENT PAY, IF YOU WORRY ABOUT
YOUR CHILDREN'S EDUCATION, IF
YOU ARE TAKING CARE OF AN ELDERLY PARENT, THEN THERE IS ONLY ONE PERSON IN THE SELECTION WILL HELP YOU, ONLY ONE PERSON
IN THIS RACE WHO WILL BE THERE, WHO HAS ALWAYS BEEN THERE FOR YOU AND THAT IS HILLARY CLINTON'S LIFE STORY.
NOT JUST WHO SHE IS, IT IS HER
LIFE STORY.
[CHEERS] SHE IS ALWAYS THERE. SHE HAS ALWAYS BEEN THERE.
[CHEERS] AND SO HAS TIM KAINE.
[CHEERS] LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, LET'S SAY THE OBVIOUS, I REALLY MEANT,
THAT IS NOT DONALD TRUMP STORY. JUST LISTEN TO ME A SECOND
WITHOUT DOING OR CHEERING.
-- BOOING OR CHEERING, HIS CYNICISM IS UNDOUBTEDLY HIS LACK
OF EMPATHY AND COMPASSION CAN BE
SUMMED UP IN THAT PHRASE HE IS
MOST PROUD OF MAKING FAMOUS, YOU'RE FIRED. I'M NOT JOKING.
THINK ABOUT THAT. THINK ABOUT THAT. THINK ABOUT EVERYTHING YOU
LEARNED AS A CHILD. NO MATTER WHERE YOU WERE RAISED,
HOW CAN THERE BE PLEASURE IN SAYING YOU'RE FIRED? HE IS TRYING TO TELL US HE CARES
ABOUT THE MIDDLE CLASS. GIVE ME A BREAK. THAT IS A BUNCH OF MALARKEY.
[CHEERS] WHATEVER HE THINKS, WHATEVER HE THINKS, AND I MEAN IS FROM THE
BOTTOM OF MY HEART, I KNOW I'M
CALLED MIDDLE-CLASS JOE AND IN WASHINGTON, THAT IS NOT MEANT AS A COMPLIMENT. IT MEANS YOU ARE NOT
SOPHISTICATED.
I KNOW WHY WE ARE STRONG, I KNOW WHY WE ARE HELD TOGETHER, I KNOW
WHY WE ARE UNITED, IT IS BECAUSE THERE HAS ALWAYS BEEN A GROWING MIDDLE CLASS.
THIS GUY DOES NOT HAVE A CLUE ABOUT THE MIDDLE CLASS. NOT A CLUE.
[CHEERS] BECAUSE FOLKS, WHEN THE HILL CLASS -- MIDDLE CLASS DOES WELL,
THE RICH DO VERY WELL AND THE
POOR HAVE HOPE. THEY HAVE A WAY OUT.
HE HAS NO CLUE ABOUT WHAT MAKES
AMERICA GREAT. ACTUALLY, HE HAS NO CLUE PERIOD.
[CHEERS]
>> NOT A CLUE! NOT A CLUE! NOT A CLUE!
>> FOLKS, LET ME SAY, LET ME SAY SOMETHING THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO
WITH POLITICS. LET ME TALK ABOUT SOMETHING THAT
I'M DEADLY SERIOUS ABOUT. THIS IS A COMPLICATED AND UNCERTAIN WORLD WE LIVE IN. THE THREATS ARE TWO GREAT -- TOO GREAT, THE TIMES ARE TOO
UNCERTAIN TO ELECT DONALD TRUMP AS RESIDENT OF THE UNITED
STATES.
LET ME FINISH, NO MAJOR PARTY,
NO MAJOR PARTY NOMINEE IN THE
HISTORY OF THE STATION HAS EVER KNOWN LESS OR BEEN LESS PREPARED
TO DO WITH OUR NATIONAL SECURITY
-- DEAL WITH OUR NATIONAL
SECURITY. WE CANNOT ELECT A MAN WHO
EXPLOITS OUR FEARS OF ISIS AND
OTHER TERRORISTS, WHO HAS NO PLAN WHATSOEVER TO MAKE A SAFER. A MAN WHO EMBRACES THE TACTICS
OF OUR ENEMIES, TORTURE, RELIGIOUS INTOLERANCE, YOU ALL KNOW. OTHER REPUBLICANS NO, THAT IS NOT WHO WE ARE. IT BETRAYS OUR VALUES. IT ALIENATES THOSE WHO WE NEED
IN THE FIGHT AGAINST ISIS. DONALD TRUMP, WITH ALL HIS RHETORIC WOULD LITERALLY MAKE US
LESS SAFE.
WE CANNOT ELECT A MAN WHO
BELITTLES OUR CLOSEST ALLIES
WHILE EMBRACING DICTATORS LIKE
VLADIMIR PUTIN. I MEAN IT.
[CHEERS] A MAN WHO SEEKS TO GO -- SOW
DIVISION IN AMERICA FOR HIS OWN GAIN AND DISORDER AROUND THE
WORLD.
A MAN WHO CONFUSES BLUSTER WITH
STRENGTH. WE SIMPLY CANNOT LET THAT HAPPEN AS AMERICANS.
[CHEERS] PERIOD.
[CHEERS] FOLKS --
[CHEERS] I HAVE, WHATEVER DOUBTS I MEAN
WHAT I SAY.
BUT SOMETIMES I SAY ALL THAT I
MEAN. LET ME TELL YOU WHAT I LITERALLY TELL EVERYONE LEADER I'VE MET
WITH.
AND I MET THEM ALL, IT IS NEVER,
NEVER, NEVER BEEN A GOOD BET AGAINST AMERICA.
[CHEERS] WE HAVE THE FINEST FIGHTING
FORCE IN THE WORLD. NOT ONLY --
[CHEERS] NOT ONLY DO WE HAVE THE LARGEST
ECONOMY IN THE WORLD, WE HAVE
THE STRONGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD.
[CHEERS] WE HAVE THE MOST PRODUCTIVE
WORKERS IN THE WORLD. AND GIVE IT A FAIR SHOT. GIVEN A FAIR CHANCE. AMERICANS HAVE NEVER, EVER, EVER, EVER, EVER LET THE COUNTRY DOWN.
[CHEERS] NEVER!
[CHEERS] ORDINARY PEOPLE LIKE US, WHO DO EXTRAORDINARY THINGS, WE HAD CANDIDATES BEFORE ATTEMPTING GET
ELECTED BY APPEALING TO OUR FEARS, BUT THEY'VE NEVER SUCCEEDED BECAUSE WE DO NOT
SCARE EASILY. WE NEVER BOW, WE NEVER BREAK,
WHEN CONFRONTED WITH CRISIS. WE ENDURE! WE OVERCOME AND WE ALWAYS MOVE FORWARD.
[CHEERS] THAT IS WHY.
[CHEERS] THAT IS WHY I CAN SAY, WITHOUT SALUTE -- ABSOLUTE CONVICTION THAT I AM MORE OPTIMISTIC ABOUT OUR CHANCES TODAY THAN WHEN I WAS ELECTED AS A 29-YEAR-OLD KID
TO THE SENATE. THE 21ST CENTURY IS GOING TO BE
THE AMERICAN CENTURY.
[CHEERS] BECAUSE WE LEAD NOT ONLY BY
EXAMPLE OF OUR POWER, BUT BY THE POWER OF OUR EXAMPLE.
[CHEERS] THAT IS THE HISTORY OF THE
JOURNEY OF AMERICANS.
AND GOD WILLING, HILLARY CLINTON WILL WRITE THE NEXT CHAPTER IN
THAT JOURNEY. WE ARE AMERICA, SECOND TO NONE,
AND WE OWNED THE FINISH LINE -- OWN THE FINISH LINE!
DON'T FORGET IT!
[CHEERS] GOD BLESS YOU ALL AND[CHEERS] GOD PROTECT OUR TROOPS!

<strong>Kasim Reed</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> HELLO, GOVERNOR!
[CHEERS] GOOD EVENING.
[CHEERS] AS THE MAYOR OF ATLANTA, THE
CITY THAT BURNED TO THE GROUND
AND ROSE AGAIN FROM THE ASHES,
THE BIRTHPLACE<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> OF DR. MARTIN
LUTHER KING JR. AND THE HOME OF
THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT, AND BECAUSE WE WERE A CITY TOO BUSY
TO HATE, WE ARE NOW AT THE ECONOMIC CENTER OF THE SOUTHEAST. I'M HERE TODAY BECAUSE I BELIEVE
IN OUR FUTURE, I BELIEVE WE HAVE
A RESPONSIBILITY TO ONE ANOTHER, AND TO THE NEXT GENERATION TO
ENSURE THAT OUR OPPORTUNITIES ARE LIMITED ONLY BY OUR IMAGINATION. I SHARE THIS BELIEF WITH HILLARY
CLINTON. THAT OUR ACHIEVEMENTS ARE ONLY
LIMITED BY WHAT WE CAN DREAM AND DO. YOU SEE, ATLANTA IS A CITY OF DREAMERS. BUT WHEN I BECAME MAYOR OF THE
CITY, THE CITY WAS STRUGGLING.
THE WORST RECESSION IN 80 YEARS.
WE WERE DOWN, CRIME WITHOUT, BUT
I LOOKED -- CRIME WAS UP, I
LOOKED AROUND OUR CITY AND I SAW
THE WAY FORWARD WAS TO LEAN ON ONE ANOTHER, TO TURN TO ONE ANOTHER AND TO MAKE AN
UNSHAKABLE AGREEMENT THAT IF A YOUNG PERSON WAS WILLING TO
LEARN, WE WOULD PUT A BOOK IN HER HANDS.
IF A YOUNG MAN WAS WILLING TO WORK, WE WOULD PUT A JOB IN A
PAYCHECK IN HIS HANDS. AND IF YOU ARE WILLING TO STEP UP AND WE WILL MEET YOU HALFWAY
AND TOGETHER WE CAN PUT YOUR
FUTURE BACK IN YOUR HANDS.
PEOPLE WANT TO DREAM AGAIN.
[CHEERS] WE TURNED OUR CITY AROUND.
AT THE SAME TIME, PRESIDENT
BARACK OBAMA AND VICE PRESIDENT
JOE BIDEN WERE TURNING AMERICA
AROUND. TODAY, WE ARE STRONGER, AND WE
WILL GROW STRONGER STILL, WHEN
PRESIDENT HILLARY CLINTON BUILDS AN ECONOMY THAT WORKS FOR EVERYONE.
[APPLAUSE] MAYOR REED: MY FELLOW DEMOCRATS,
TONIGHT, WE CHOOSE DIVERSITY
OVER DIVISION.
WE CHOOSE A STEADY HANDED
COMMANDER IN CHIEF OVER A LOOSE
CANNON. WE CHOOSE A LEADER WHO WOULD
RATHER BE IN THE TRENCHES,
SECURING HEALTH CARE FOR 8 MILLION CHILDREN, THEN IN A
SWEET PUTTING HIS NAME ON A
TOWER THAT HE PROBABLY DOESN'T
OWN. WE CHOOSE SOMETHING DIFFERENT
TONIGHT.
[APPLAUSE] MAYOR REED: I BELIEVE AMERICANS
ARE READY TO GET TO WORK.
TO MAKE THE POSSIBLE, REAL. HILLARY CLINTON IS THE LEADER TO
TAKE US THERE. PRESIDENT HARRY TRUMAN ONCE SAID, "THERE ARE A SMALL NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN AMERICA WHO HAVE THE POWER, AND THE PRESTIGE, AND
THE CONNECTIONS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEIR INTERESTS ARE LOOKED AFTER." BUT HE SAID, "FOR
EVERYBODY ELSE, THERE IS THE
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES."
AND THAT IS WHY WE NEED HILLARY
CLINTON.
[APPLAUSE] MAYOR REED: MORE THAN 60 YEARS LATER, HIS STATEMENT HOLDS TRUE
TONIGHT. AND TONIGHT, WE HAVE SOMEONE WHO
WILL LOOK OUT FOR ALL AMERICANS,
AND WHO WILL DO SO EVERY DAY OF HER PRESIDENCY, WITH ALL OF HER
HEART.
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WE HAVE
OUR CHAMPION, HILLARY CLINTON.
LET ME HEAR YOU.
[APPLAUSE] MAYOR REED: AND NOW, I AM HONORED TO INTRODUCE SOMEONE WHO HAS BEEN A FRIEND AND MENTOR TO
ME DURING MY TIME AS MAYOR. MICHAEL BLOOMBERG HAS ARTICULATED AND OPTIMISTIC PERFORMANCE, A UNIVERSAL VISION THAT HAS BUILT NEW YORK CITY AND HAS ALSO HELPED OTHER CITIES
AROUND THE WORLD.
THANKS TO HIS PERFECT -- HIS PHILANTHROPY, HE HAS DONE SO MUCH.
PLEASE JOIN ME IN WELCOMING A MAN WHOSE COMMITMENT TO AMERICA TRANSCENDS POLITICS. THE THREE-TIME MAYOR OF THE CITY
OF NEW YORK, MICHAEL BLOOMBERG.

<strong>Michael R. Bloomberg</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> MR. BLOOMBERG: THANK YOU.
THANK YOU. KASIM, THANK YOU FOR THE KIND
INTRODUCTION. AND LET ME HANG ALL OF YOU FOR WELCOMING AN OUTSIDER HERE, TO DELIVER<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> -- 
[APPLAUSE] MR. BLOOMBERG: AN OUTSIDER, TO
DELIVER WHAT WILL BE AN
UNCONVENTIONAL CONVENTION
SPEECH. NOW, I AM NOT HERE AS A MEMBER
OF ANY PARTY. OR TO ENDORSE ANY PARTY
PLATFORM.
I AM HERE FOR ONE REASON. TO EXPLAIN WHY I BELIEVE IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT WE ELECT HILLARY CLINTON AS THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF
THE UNITED STATES.
[APPLAUSE] MR. BLOOMBERG: AND TO ASK YOU TO JOIN WITH ME IN SUPPORTING HER
THIS NOVEMBER. YOU KNOW, WHEN THE FOUNDING
FATHERS ARRIVED HERE IN
PHILADELPHIA TO FORGE A NEW NATION, THEY DIDN'T COME AS DEMOCRATS OR REPUBLICANS, OR TO
NOMINATE A PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE.
THEY CAME AS PATRIOTS WHO FEARED PARTY POLITICS, AND I KNOW HOW
THEY FELT. I HAVE BEEN A DEMOCRAT, I HAVE
BEEN A REPUBLICAN, AND I HAVE BEEN -- I EVENTUALLY BECAME AN INDEPENDENT, BECAUSE I DON'T BELIEVE THAT EITHER PARTY HAS A MONOPOLY ON GOOD IDEAS OR STRONG LEADERSHIP.
[APPLAUSE] MR. BLOOMBERG: WHEN I ENTER THE
VOTING BOOTH EACH TIME, I LOOK
AT THE CANDIDATES, NOT THE PARTY LABEL. I HAVE SUPPORTED ELECTORATE --
ELECTED OFFICIALS FROM BOTH SIDE
OF THE AISLE, AND PROBABLY, NOT MANY PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM CAN SAY THAT.
BUT I KNOW THERE ARE MANY
WATCHING AT HOME WHO CAN. AND NOW, THEY ARE CAREFULLY WEIGHING THEIR CHOICES.
I UNDERSTAND THEIR DILEMMA. I KNOW WHAT IT IS LIKE TO HAVE
NEITHER PARTY FULLY REPRESENT MY
VIEWS OR VALUES.
TOO MANY REPUBLICANS, BLAME IMMIGRANTS FOR THE PROBLEMS. THEY STAND IN THE WAY OF ACTION ON CLIMATE CHANGE AND GUN
VIOLENCE.
MEANWHILE, MANY DEMOCRATS, I
THINK WRONGLY, BLAME THE PRIVATE SECTOR FOR OUR PROBLEMS AND THEY STAND IN THE WAY OF ACTION ON EDUCATION AND DEFICIT REDUCTION.
THERE ARE TIMES WHEN I DISAGREE WITH HILLARY CLINTON. BUT LET ME TELL YOU, WHATEVER
OUR DISAGREEMENTS MAY BE, I HAVE
COME HERE TO SAY, WE MUST PUT THEM ASIDE FOR THE GOOD OF OUR COUNTRY.
[APPLAUSE] MR. BLOOMBERG: AND WE MUST UNITE AROUND THE CANDIDATE WHO CAN
DEFEAT A DANGEROUS DEMAGOGUE.
[APPLAUSE] MR. BLOOMBERG: I BELIEVE IT IS
THE DUTY OF ALL AMERICAN
CITIZENS TO MAKE OUR VOICES
HEARD BY VOTING IN THIS
ELECTION. AND IF YOU ARE NOT YET
REGISTERED TO VOTE, GO ONLINE
AND DO IT NOW. THIS IS TOO IMPORTANT TO SIT
OUT.
[APPLAUSE] MR. BLOOMBERG: NOW, WE HAVE HEARD A LOT OF TALK IN THIS CAMPAIGN ABOUT NEEDING A LEADER WHO UNDERSTANDS BUSINESS.
I COULDN'T AGREE MORE. I BUILT A BUSINESS, AND I DIDN'T
START IT WITH A MILLION-DOLLAR
CHECK FROM MY FATHER.
[APPLAUSE] MR. BLOOMBERG: BECAUSE OF MY
SUCCESS IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR, I
HAD THE CHANCE TO RUN AMERICA'S LARGEST CITY OR 12 YEARS,
GOVERNING IN THE WAKE OF ITS
GREATEST TRAGEDY.
TODAY, AS AN INDEPENDENT AND AN ENTREPRENEUR AND A FORMER MAYOR,
I BELIEVE WE HAVE IT -- NEED A
PRESIDENT WHO IS A PROBLEM
SOLVER, NOT A BOMB THROWER.
[APPLAUSE] MR. BLOOMBERG: SOMEONE WHO CAN
BRING MEMBERS OF CONGRESS
TOGETHER TO GET BIG THINGS DONE,
AND I KNOW HILLARY CAN DO THAT,
BECAUSE I SAW IT FIRST HAND. I WAS ELECTED MAYOR TWO MONTHS AFTER 9/11, AS A REPUBLICAN.
AND I SAW HOW HILLARY WORKED
WITH REPUBLICANS IN WASHINGTON TO ENSURE NEW YORK GOT THE HELP THEY NEEDED TO RECOVER AND REBUILD.
THROUGHOUT HER TIME IN THE
SENATE, YES, THROUGHOUT HER TIME
IN THE SENATE, WE DIDN'T ALWAYS AGREE, BUT HILLARY CLINTON
ALWAYS LISTENED. AND THAT IS THE KIND OF APPROACH WE NEED IN WASHINGTON TODAY, AND
IT JUST HAS TO START IN THE
WHITE HOUSE.
[APPLAUSE] MR. BLOOMBERG: GIVEN MY BACKGROUND, I WILL OFTEN
ENCOURAGE BUSINESS LEADERS TO
RUN FOR OFFICE, BECAUSE MANY OF
THEM SHARE THE SAME PRAGMATIC APPROACH TO BUILDING CONSENSUS. BUT NOT ALL.
MOST OF US WHO HAVE CREATED A
BUSINESS KNOW THERE -- WE ARE ONLY AS GOOD AS HOW OUR EMPLOYEES, CLIENTS, AND
CUSTOMERS VIEW WAS. MOST OF US DON'T PRETEND WE ARE
SMART ENOUGH TO MAKE EVERY
DECISION BY OURSELVES, AND MOST
OF US WHO HAVE OUR NAMES ON THE
DOOR KNOW WE ARE ONLY AS GOOD AS
OUR WORD. BUT NOT DONALD TRUMP.
[APPLAUSE] MR. BLOOMBERG: THROUGH HIS CAREER, THE DONALD TRUMP HAS
LEFT BEHIND HAS LEFT BEHIND A WELL-DOCUMENTED OR -- RECORD OF
BANKRUPTCIES, LAWSUITS, ANGRY
STOCKHOLDERS, AND CONGRESS MERGERS -- CONTRACTORS WHO FEEL
THEY HAVE BEEN TRICKED -- THEY
HAVE BEEN CHEATED.
TRUMP WANTS TO RUN THE NATION LIKE HE RUNS HIS BUSINESS?
GOD HELP US.
[APPLAUSE] MR. BLOOMBERG: I AM A NEW YORKER, AND I KNOW A CON WHEN I
SEE ONE.
[APPLAUSE] MR. BLOOMBERG: TRUMP SAYS HE WILL PUNISH MANUFACTURERS THAT
MOVED TO MEXICO OR CHINA.
BUT THE CLOTHES HE CELLS ARE
MADE OVERSEAS AT LOW-WAGE FACTORIES. HE SAYS HE WANTS TO PUT
AMERICANS BACK TO WORK, BUT HE GAINS -- GAINS -- GAMES THE VISA
SYSTEM SO HE CAN HIRE LOW-WAGE
WORKERS.
HE SAYS HE WANTED A PORT -- WANTS TO DEPORT UNDOCUMENTED PEOPLE, BUT HE SEEMS TO HAVE NO
PROBLEM HIRING THEM.
WHAT DID I MISS HERE? TRUTH BE TOLD, THE RICHEST THING
ABOUT DONALD TRUMP IS HIS
HYPOCRISY.
[APPLAUSE] MR. BLOOMBERG: HE WANTS YOU TO
BELIEVE THAT WE CAN SOLVE OUR
BIGGEST PROBLEMS BY DEPORTING
MEXICANS AND SHUTTING OUT
MUSLIMS. HE WANTS YOU TO BELIEVE THAT
ERECTING TRADE BARRIERS WILL
BRING BACK GOOD JOBS. HE IS WRONG ON BOTH COUNTS. WE CAN ONLY SOLVE OUR BIGGEST PROBLEMS IF WE COME TOGETHER AND EMBRACE THE FREEDOMS THAT OUR
FOUNDING FATHERS ESTABLISHED
RIGHT HERE IN PHILADELPHIA. WHICH PERMITTED OUR ANCESTORS TO
CREATE THE GREAT AMERICAN EXCEPTIONALISM THAT ALL OF US
NOW ENJOY. DONALD TRUMP DOESN'T UNDERSTAND THAT.
HILLARY CLINTON DOES.
[APPLAUSE] MR. BLOOMBERG: AND WE CAN ONLY
CREATE GOOD JOBS IF WE MAKE SMARTER INVESTMENTS IN
INFRASTRUCTURE, AND DO MORE TO
SUPPORT SMALL BUSINESSES, NOT
STIFF THEM.
DONALD TRUMP DOESN'T UNDERSTAND
THAT. HILLARY CLINTON DOES.
[APPLAUSE] MR. BLOOMBERG: I UNDERSTAND THE
APPEAL OF A BUSINESSMAN PRESIDENT. BUT TRUMPS BUSINESS PLAN IS A
DISASTER IN THE MAKING. HE WOULD MAKE IT HARDER FOR
SMALL BUSINESSES TO COMPETE, DO
GREAT DAMAGE TO THE ECONOMY, THREATEN THE RETIREMENT SAVINGS
OF MILLIONS OF AMERICANS, LEAD
TO GREATER DEBT AND MORE EMPLOYMENT, ERODE OUR INFLUENCE AROUND THE WORLD AND MAKE OUR COMMUNITIES LESS SAFE. THE BOTTOM LINE IS, DONALD TRUMP
IS A RISKY, RECKLESS AND RADICAL
CHOICE, AND WE CAN'T AFFORD TO
MAKE THAT CHOICE.
[APPLAUSE] MR. BLOOMBERG: NOW, I KNOW HILLARY CLINTON IS NOT FLAWLESS. NO CANDIDATE IS.
BUT SHE IS THE RIGHT CHOICE, AND
THE RESPONSIBLE CHOICE IN THIS ELECTION.
[APPLAUSE] MR. BLOOMBERG: AND NO MATTER WHAT YOU MAY THINK ABOUT HER
POLITICS OR HER RECORD, HILLARY CLINTON UNDERSTANDS THAT THIS IS
NOT REALITY TELEVISION. THIS IS REALITY.
[APPLAUSE] MR. BLOOMBERG: SHE UNDERSTANDS
THE JOB OF PRESIDENT.
IT INVOLVES FINDING SOLUTIONS, NOT POINTING FINGERS. OFFERING HOPE, NOT STOKING FEAR. OVER THE COURSE OF OUR COUNTRY'S PROUD HISTORY, WE HAVE FACED OUR
SHARE OF GRAVE CHALLENGES. BUT WE HAVE NEVER RETREATED IN
FEAR.
NEVER. NOT HERE IN PHILADELPHIA IN 1776, NOT AT GETTYSBURG IN 1863, NOT THROUGH TWO WORLD WARS AND
THE GREAT DEPRESSION, NOT AT SELMA OR STONE WALL, NOT AFTER
9/11.
WE MUST NOT START NOW.
[APPLAUSE] AMERICA, AMERICA IS THE GREATEST
COUNTRY ON EARTH. AND WHEN PEOPLE -- PEOPLE COME
HERE.
THE PRESIDENCY OF THE UNITED
STATES IS THE MOST POWERFUL OFFICE IN THE WORLD.
I SAY TO MY FELLOW INDEPENDENCE, YOUR VOTES MATTER NOW. YOUR VOTE WILL DETERMINE THE
FUTURE OF YOUR JOB, YOUR BUSINESS, AND OUR FUTURE TOGETHER AS A COUNTRY. TO ME, THIS ELECTION IS NOT A
CHOICE BETWEEN A DEMOCRAT AND A
REPUBLICAN. IT IS A CHOICE BETWEEN WHO IS
BETTER TO LEAD OUR COUNTRY RIGHT
NOW.
[APPLAUSE] MR. BLOOMBERG: BETTER FOR OUR ECONOMY, BETTER FOR OUR SECURITY, BETTER FOR OUR
FREEDOM, AND BETTER FOR OUR
FUTURE.
THERE IS NO DOUBT IN MY MIND THAT HILLARY CLINTON IS THE RIGHT CHOICE THIS NOVEMBER.
[APPLAUSE] MR. BLOOMBERG: SO TONIGHT, AS AN INDEPENDENT, I AM ASKING YOU TO JOIN WITH ME, NOT OUT OF PARTY
LOYALTY, BUT OUT OF LOVE OF
COUNTRY. AND TOGETHER, AND TOGETHER,
LET'S SELECT A SANE, CONFIDENT PERSON WITH INTERNATIONAL EXPERIENCE.
[APPLAUSE] MR. BLOOMBERG: A UNIFIER WHO IS
MATURE ENOUGH TO REACH OUT FOR ADVICE, TO BUILD CONSENSUS AND
TO RECOGNIZE THAT WE ALL HAVE
SOMETHING TO CONTRIBUTE. SO LET'S ELECT HILLARY CLINTON
AS THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE GREATEST COUNTRY IN THE WORLD, THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THANK YOU.

<strong>Tim Kaine</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> THANK YOU EVERYBODY. HELLO, PHILADELPHIA! HELLO DEMOCRATIC FAMILIES. I WANT TO START OFF BY THANKING MY BEAUTIFUL WIFE AND MY THREE WONDERFUL CHILDREN.<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> THEY ARE SITTING RIGHT UP THERE.
[CHEERS] MY SON DEPLOYED WITH HIS MARINE BATTALION JUST TWO DAYS AGO.
[CHEERS] HE DEPLOYED OVERSEAS TO PROTECT AND DEFEND THE VERY NATO ALLIES
THAT DONALD TRUMP SAYS HE NOW
WANTS TO ABANDON.
>> BOO!
>> SEMPER FI, MATT!
[CHEERS] MY PARENTS AND MY IN-LAWS ARE
HERE. OUR SIBLINGS AND SPOUSES. OUR NIECES AND NEPHEWS AND
HUNDREDS OF FRIENDS FROM VIRGINIA AND BEYOND.
[CHEERS] I LOVE SEEING YOU FRONT AND CENTER. INCLUDING MY FRIEND OF 37 YEARS,
SENIOR SENATOR MARK WARNER.
[CHEERS] MIGRATE GOVERNOR TERRY MCAULIFFE.
[CHEERS] IN MY GREAT FRIEND AND CONGRESSMAN OBVIOUS GOD.
[CHEERS]
-- BOBBY SCOTT.
[CHEERS] WE LOVE YOU ALL. TODAY, FOR MY WIFE ANNE AND
EVERY STRONG WOMAN IN THIS COUNTRY, FOR MY CHILDREN, AND
EVERY YOUNG PERSON STARTING OUT THEIR LIFE TO MAKE YOUR DREAMS REAL, FOR EVERY MAN AND WOMAN
SERVING OUR COUNTRY IN THE
MILITARY AT HOME OR ABROAD, FOR
EVERY WORKING FAMILY WORKING
HARD TO GET AHEAD AND STAY AHEAD
, FOR MY PARENTS AND IN-LAWS IN
EVERY SENIOR CITIZEN WHO HOPES
FOR A DIGNIFIED RETIREMENT WITH HEALTH CARE AND RESEARCH TO END DISEASES LIKE ALZHEIMER'S.
[CHEERS] FOR EVERY AMERICAN WHO WANTS OUR COUNTRY TO BE A BELOVED COMMUNITY WHERE PEOPLE ARE NOT DEMEANED BECAUSE OF WHO THEY ARE BUT RATHER RESPECTED FURTHER CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE NATION AND
FOR ALL OF US WHO KNOW THAT THE
BRIGHTEST FUTURE FOR OUR COUNTRY
IS THE ONE THAT WE BUILD TOGETHER AND MY FRIEND, HILLARY CLINTON, I HUMBLY ACCEPT MY
PARTY'S NOMINATION TO BE VICE
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.
[CHEERS] THANK YOU.
[CHEERS] CAN I BE HONEST WITH YOU ABOUT
SOMETHING? CAN I BE HONEST WITH YOU ABOUT SOMETHING? I NEVER EXPECTED TO BE HERE. LET ME TYPE HOW IT HAPPENED, I WAS BORN IN MINNESOTA AND
GROPING KANSAS CITY.
-- GREW UP IN KANSAS CITY.
[CHEERS] MY FOLKS WERE NOT MUCH INTO POLITICS. MY DAD RAN A UNION IRON WORKING SHOT -- SHOP.
[CHEERS] AND MY MOM WAS HIS BEST
SALESMAN. MY TWO BROTHERS AND I PITCHED INTO WORK DURING SUMMERS AND,
YOU KNOW, THAT IS HOW SMALL BUSINESSES DO IT. MY PARENTS, HERE TONIGHT AND
GOING STRONG, THEY TAUGHT ME
ABOUT HARD WORK AND KINDNESS AND
MOST ESPECIALLY, ABOUT FAITH. I WENT TO A DESOLATE NOISE HIGH
SCHOOL.
-- JESUIT BOYS HIGH SCHOOL.
[CHEERS] THAT'S A BIG LINE FOR THE JESUITS. WE HAD A MOTTO IN OUR SCHOOL,
MEANT FOR OTHERS.
-- ME FN FOR OTHERS.IT
WAS THERE THAT MY FAITH BECAME
VITAL. MY NORTH STAR FOR ORIENTED MY
LIFE. WHEN I LEFT HIGH SCHOOL, I KNEW THAT I WANTED TO BATTLE FOR
SOCIAL JUSTICE.
[CHEERS] LIKE SO MANY OF YOU.
[CHEERS] THAT IS WHY I TOOK A YEAR OFF
FROM MOSCOW TO VOLUNTEER WITH DESOLATE MISSIONARIES IN
HONDURAS. I TALK ITS HOW TO WELDERS AND
CARPENTERS. APRENDI LOS VALORES DEL PUEBLO: FE, FAMILIA, Y TRABAJO. FAITH, FAMILY AND WORK. LOS MISMOS VALORES DEL LOS QUE AQUI. SOMOS AMERICANOS TODOS. LET ME TELL YOU WHAT REALLY STRUCK ME THERE, I GOT A FIRSTHAND LOOK AT A DIFFERENT
SYSTEM.
A DICTATORSHIP. WHERE A FEW PEOPLE AT THE TOP
HAD ALL THE POWER AND EVERYBODY ELSE GOT LEFT OUT. THAT CONVINCED ME THAT WE HAVE
GOT TO ADVANCE OPPORTUNITY FOR
EVERYBODY, NO MATTER WHERE YOU
COME FROM, HOW MUCH MONEY YOU HAVE, WHAT YOU LOOK LIKE, HOW YOU WORSHIP OR WHO YOU LOVE.
[CHEERS] BACK IN 1970, IN VIRGINIA, A
REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR BELIEVED
ABSOLUTELY THE SAME THING. HE INTEGRATED VIRGINIA'S PUBLIC
SCHOOLS SO THAT BLACK-AND-WHITE KIDS COULD FINALLY LEARN TOGETHER AND THEN THE FAMILY
ENROLLED THEIR OWN KIDS, INCLUDING HIS DAUGHTER, INTO THE
INTEGRATED SCHOOLS WITH MANY
LEADERS -- YEARS LATER SHE WENT
COLLEGE ABOUT THOSE LESSONS WITH
HER. ONE DAY, IN A STUDY GROUP SHE
MET THIS GOOD BEGOTTEN WHO HAD
BEEN OFF TEACHING KIDS IN
HONDURAS. ANNE AND I HAVE NOW BEEN
MARRIED, 32 YEARS AND I'M THE LUCKIEST HUSBAND IN THE WORLD.
[CHEERS] LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING, AND
PARENTS ARE HERE TODAY 90 PLUS
AND GOING STRONG.
[CHEERS] LINWOOD HOLTON, HE IS STILL A
REPUBLICAN BUT HE IS VOTING FOR
AN AWFUL LOT OF DEMOCRATS THESE DAYS.
[CHEERS] AND HERE IS WHY, HE IS VOTING
FOR DEMOCRATS BECAUSE ANY PARTY THAT WOULD NOMINATE DONALD TRUMP
FOR PRESIDENT HAS MOVED TOO FAR AWAY FROM HIS PARTY OF LINCOLN.
[CHEERS] IN A TELL YOU, IF ANY OF YOU ARE
LOOKING FOR THAT PARTY OF LINCOLN, WE HAVE A HOME FOR YOU
RIGHT HERE IN THE DEMOCRATIC
PARTY.
[CHEERS] HIS EXAMPLE HELPED INSPIRE ME AS
A CIVIL RIGHTS LAWYER. OVER 17 YEARS I TOOK ON BANKS,
LANDLORDS, REAL ESTATE FIRMS, LOCAL GOVERNMENTS, ANYONE WHO TREATED ANYBODY UNFAIRLY. I HAD A SIX-YEAR CASE AGAINST AN INSURANCE COMPANY THAT WAS
DISCRIMINATING AGAINST MINORITY
NEIGHBORHOODS ALL ACROSS THE
UNITED STATES AND ISSUING
HOMEOWNER INSURANCE. DEMOCRATIC FRIENDS, THESE ARE
THE BATTLES THAT I HAVE THOUGHT MY ENTIRE LIFE.
-- THOUGHT MIGHT -- FOUGHT MY
ENTIRE LIFE.
[CHEERS] THAT IS THE STORY. THAT IS THE STORY OF HOW I
DECIDED TO RUN FOR OFFICE. MY CITY OF RICHMOND WAS DIVIDED AND DISCOURAGED IN THE EARLY 1990'S. WE HAD AN EPIDEMIC OF VIOLENCE
OVERWHELMING THE NEIGHBORHOOD. WE PEOPLE WERE POINTING FINGERS
AND CASTING BLAME. I CANNOT STAND IT. IRAN FOR CITY COUNCIL AND I WON THE FIRST RACE FOR THE 20 YEARS
BY A LANDSLIDE MARGIN OF 94 VOTES.
[CHEERS] AND THAT SAID EVER SENSE, IT IS
BECAUSE I STARTED AT THE LOCAL LEVEL LISTING TWO PEOPLE
LEARNING ABOUT THEIR LIVES AND
TRY TO GET RESULTS. I SEE AMERICA ARE WHO KNOWS WHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT. LATER I BECAME MAYOR OF
RICHMOND. THEN THE 70TH GOVERNOR OF VIRGINIA.
[CHEERS] NOW, I WAS A HARD TIMES
GOVERNOR.
I HAD TO STEER MY STAGE OF THE DEEPEST RECESSION SINCE THE 1930'S.
TOUGH TIMES DON'T LAST AND HOW
PEOPLE DO.
-- TOUGH PEOPLE DO. CAN I TELL YOU THAT VIRGINIANS
ARE TOUGH PEOPLE?
[CHEERS] WE ARE TOUGH PEOPLE. AND WE ARE SMART, TOO. WE ACHIEVE NATIONAL RECOGNITION FOR OUR WORK, BEST DATE FOR BUSINESS, BEST DATE FOR A CHILD
TO BE RAISED. LOW UNEMPLOYMENT.
HIGH MEDIAN INCOME. WE SHED TEARS ALONG THE WAY. WE SHED TEARS ESPECIALLY
TOGETHER IN THE DAYS AFTER THAT
HORRIBLE MASS SHOOTING AT
VIRGINIA TECH THAT KILLED 32
PEOPLE FROM BEAUTIFUL 19 EUROS STUDENTS TO 70 PLUS-YEAR-OLD
ROMANIAN BORN HOLOCAUST SURVIVORS AND WE SHED TEARS BUT
AFTERWARDS WE ROLLED UP OUR
SLEEVES AND WE FIXED THE LOOPHOLE IN THE BACK ON RECORD
SYSTEM SO WE COULD MAKE OUR COMMONWEALTH SAFER AND WE HAVE
TO DO THAT IN THE NATION.
[CHEERS] WE INVESTED IN OUR PEOPLE EXPANDING FREE TRADE IN HIGHER EDUCATION.
WE KNOW THAT EDUCATION IS THE KEY TO ONLY WANT TO BE.
[CHEERS] NOW HAVE THE HONOR OF
REPRESENTING MY COMMONWEALTH AND
THE SENATE.
I WORK ON THE ARMED SERVICES AND
FOREIGN RELATIONS COMMITTEE TO
KEEP US SAFE AT HOME AND STRONG
IN THE WORLD.
[CHEERS] I WORK ON THE BUDGET COMMITTEE WITH OUR GREAT DEMOCRATIC LEADERS, A SPECTACULAR SENATOR
WHO USED TO BE A MANNER -- A MAYOR FROM VERMONT, BERNIE SANDERS.
[CHEERS] AND, EVERYBODY, WE ALL SHOULD FEEL THE BERN AND WE SHOULD ALL
NOT WANT TO GET BURNED BY THE
OTHER GUY.
[CHEERS] ON THAT BUDGET COMMITTEE, WE
FIGHT FOR INVESTMENTS,
EDUCATION, HEALTH CARE, RESEARCH
AND TRANSPORTATION. I ALSO SERVE ON THE COMMITTEE TO
MAKE SURE THAT SENIORS HAVE A SECURE RETIREMENT AND DON'T GET
TARGETED BY RIPOFF ARTISTS WHO
WAS SCAMMED OUT OF THEIR SAVINGS
OR OVERCHARGE THEM FOR PRESCRIPTION DRUGS.
[CHEERS] CAN I TELL YOU A FUNNY THING
ABOUT THE SENATE?
[CHEERS] THAT SOUNDS LIKE A YES. I SPEND A LOT OF TIME WITH REPUBLICAN SENATORS WHO ONCE
THEY HAVE MADE SURE THAT NOBODY IS LISTENING, WILL TELL YOU HOW FANTASTIC A SENATOR THAT HILLARY CLINTON WAS.
[CHEERS] LOOK, THIS JOURNEY THAT I'VE
TOLD YOU ABOUT HAS CONVINCED ME,
HAS CONVINCED ME OVER AND OVER AGAIN THAT GOD HAS CREATED IN
OUR COUNTRY A BEAUTIFUL AND RICH TAPESTRY, AN INCREDIBLE CULTURAL DIVERSITY THAT SUCCEEDS WHEN WE EMBRACE EVERYBODY AND BATTLE BACK, THE DARK FORCES OF
DIVISION. WE ARE ALL NEIGHBORS. WE MUST LOVE NEIGHBORS AS
OURSELVES. HILLARY CLINTON AND I SON COM PANEROS DE ALMA.
[CHEERS] WE SHARE THIS IS SIMPLY.
-- SIMPLE BELIEF. DO ALL THE GOOD YOU CAN AND
SERVE ONE ANOTHER.
[CHEERS] THAT IS WHAT I'M ABOUT. THAT IS WHAT YOU ARE ABOUT. THAT IS WHAT BERNIE SANDERS IS
ABOUT.
THAT IS WHAT JOE AND JILL BIDEN ARE ABOUT. THAT IS WHAT BARACK AND MICHELLE OBAMA ARE ABOUT AND THAT IS WHAT
HILLARY CLINTON IS ABOUT.
[CHEERS] SI SE PUEDE!
[CHEERS] YES WE CAN. YES WE CAN.
[CHEERS] LAST WEEK, LAST WEEK IN
CLEVELAND WE HEARD A LOT ABOUT TRUMP. LET'S TALK ABOUT TRUST. I WANT TO TELL YOU WHY I TRUST HILLARY CLINTON.
[CHEERS] FIRST, SHE'S CONSISTENT.
SHE HAS BATTLED TO PUT KIDS AND FAMILIES FIRST SINCE SHE WAS A
TEENAGER. IN GOOD TIMES AND BAD.
IN VICTORY AND DEFEAT. IN AND OUT OF OFFICE THROUGH HELL OR HIGH WATER FIGHTING FOR UNDERPRIVILEGED KIDS WORKING AT THE CHILDREN'S DEFENSE FUND. BITING TO GET HEALTH INSURANCE
FOR 8 MILLION LOW INCOME
CHILDREN. FIGHTING FOR THE WELL-BEING OF
WOMEN AND CHILDREN AROUND THE
WORLD.
[CHEERS] CAN OFFER YOU A LITTLE TIP? WHEN YOU WANT TO KNOW SOMETHING
ABOUT THE CHARACTER OF SOMEBODY
IN PUBLIC LIFE, LOOK TO SEE IF
THEY HAVE A PASSION THAT BEGAN
LONG BEFORE THEY WERE IN OFFICE. AND THAT THEY HAVE CONSISTENTLY
HELD IT SINCE THEIR CAREER.
[CHEERS] DO THEY HAVE A PASSION, DID IT START BEFORE THEY WERE IN
OFFICE, HAVE A HELP ONTO IT
CONSISTENTLY? HILLARY HAS A PASSION FOR KIDS AND FAMILIES.
[CHEERS] DONALD TRUMP HAS A PASSION, IT IS HIMSELF.
[CHEERS] WITH HILLARY, IT IS NOT JUST WORDS AND A COMPETENCE. SHE DELIVERS AS A SENATOR. SHE BATTLED AFTER 9/11. HE WENT TO THE TOWERS, WENT TO
THE PENTAGON AND SAVE THE
VICTIMS OF THE TERRORIST
ATTACKS. AS SECRETARY OF STATE, SHE IMPLEMENTED TOUGH SANCTIONS AGAINST IRAN TO PAY THE WAY FOR A DIPLOMATIC RATE THROUGH TO CURTAIL -- BREAKTHROUGH TO
CURTAIL A NUCLEAR WEAPONS
PROGRAM. SHE WAS NOT AFRAID, SHE WAS NOT
AFRAID. SHE WAS NOT AFRAID TO STAND UP TO DICTATORS. THEY DECIDED TO GO TO THE END OF THE EARTH TO WIPE OUT OSAMA BIN LADEN IS.
-- OSAMA BIN LADEN.
[CHEERS] DID Y'ALL REMEMBER THE LITTLE
GIRL WE HEARD FROM ON MONDAY NIGHT WAS WORRIED THAT HER PARENTS WOULD BE DEPORTED? CARLA SAID SHE TRUSTS HILLARY TO
KEEP THEM TOGETHER.
[CHEERS] IN THE MEMBER -- DO YOU REMEMBER
THE MOTHERS OF THE MOVEMENT LAST
NIGHT?
[CHEERS] THEY SAID THEY TRUST HILLARY TO
KEEP OTHER MOTHERS'  SONS AND
DAUGHTERS SAFE. AND ON A PERSONAL LEVEL, AS HE IS SERVING OUR NATION ABROAD, I TRUST HILLARY CLINTON WITH OUR SONS LIFE.
[CHEERS] YOU KNOW WHO I DON'T TRUST? I WONDER. DONALD TRUMP. TRUMP IS A GUY WHO PROMISES A LOT BUT, YOU MAY HAVE NOTICED,
HE HAS A WAY OF SAYING THE SAME TWO WORDS EVERY TIME HE MAKES HIS BIGGEST, HE JUST PROMISES. BELIEVE ME. IT IS GOING TO BE GREAT, BELIEVE
ME. WE ARE TO BUILD A WALL AND MAKE MEXICO PAY FOR, BELIEVE ME.
[LAUGHTER] WE ARE GOING TO DESTROY ISSA SO
FAST, BELIEVE ME.
[LAUGHTER] THERE IS NOTHING SUSPICIOUS AND
MY TAX RETURNS, BELIEVE ME.
[LAUGHTER]
[CHEERS] BY THE WAY, DOES ANYBODY IN THIS MASSIVE AUDITORIUM BELIEVE THAT DONALD TRUMP'S BEEN PAYING HIS
FAIR SHARE OF TAXES?
>> NOOO!
>> DOES ANYBODY HERE BELIEVE THAT DONALD TRUMP OUGHT TO
RELEASE HIS TAX RETURNS IS LIKE
EVERY OTHER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE IN MODERN HISTORY?
[CHEERS] OF COURSE HE SHOULD. DONALD, WHAT ARE YOU HIDING? AND YET, DONALD STILL SAYS BELIEVE ME.
BELIEVE ME.
[LAUGHTER] BELIEVE ME. BELIEVE ME. HERE'S THE THING, MOST PEOPLE
WHEN THEY RUN FOR PRESIDENT,
THEY DON'T JUST SAY BELIEVE ME, THEY RESPECT YOU ENOUGH TO TELL YOU HOW THEY WILL GET THINGS DONE.
[CHEERS] THAT IS WHAT MOST PEOPLE WHO RUN FOR PRESIDENT TO.
-- DO. IN FACT, HE CAN GO ON HILLARY CLINTON.COM RIGHT NOW AND FIND OUT EXACTLY HOW SHE WILL MAKE
THE BIGGEST INVESTMENT IN NEW
JOBS IN A GENERATION. HOW SHE WILL DEFEND AND BUILD ON
WALL STREET REFORMS, HOW SHE
WILL REFORM OUR IMMIGRATION
SYSTEM TO CREATE A PATH TO CITIZENSHIP HOW SHE WILL MAKE IT
POSSIBLE TO GRADUATE FROM COLLEGE DEBT-FREE. YOU WILL SEE HOW SHE WILL
PROTECT ROE BE WEIGHED, OR TO EQUAL PAY FOR WOMEN AND MAKE
PAID FAMILY A REALITY.
[CHEERS]
-- FAMILY LEAVE A REALITY.
[CHEERS] ALL IT TAKES IS ONE CLICK AND WE CAN SEE HOW SHE WILL DO IT, HOW SHE WILL PAY WITH -- FOR IT AND
HOW WE WILL BENEFIT BY IT. NOT DONALD TRUMP. NOT DONALD TRUMP. HE NEVER TELLS YOU HOW HE IS GOING TO DO ANY OF THE THINGS HE SAYS HE WILL DO.
HE JUST SAYS, BELIEVE ME.
[LAUGHTER] SO HERE'S THE QUESTION, HERE'S THE QUESTION, DO YOU REALLY
BELIEVE HIM?
>> NO!
>> DONALD TRUMP'S WHOLE CAREER
SAYS HE BETTER NOT. SMALL CONTRACTORS, COMPANIES
JUST LIKE MY DAD'S BELIEVE HIM,
LEAVE HIM CUT WHEN HE SAID -- BELIEVED HIM WHEN THEY SAID HE
WOULD PAY THE CASINO. THEY DO THE WORK, HUNG THE DRYWALL, FOR THE CONCRETE, BUT A
YEAR AFTER OPENING, DONALD TRUMP
UP BANKRUPTCY, HE WALKED AWAY
WITH MILLIONS AND THEY GOT
PENNIES ON THE DOLLAR. SOME OF THEM WENT OUT OF
BUSINESS. ALL BECAUSE THEY BELIEVED DONALD TRUMP.
>> BOO!
>> RETIREES AND FAMILIES IN FLORIDA, THEY BELIEVED DONALD TRUMP WHEN HE SAID HE WOULD
BUILD UP SOME CONDOS. THOUSANDS OF THEM. THEY PAID THEIR DEPOSITS BUT THE CONDOS, THEY WERE NEVER BUILT. HE JUST POCKETED THEIR MONEY AND
WALKED AWAY. THEY LOST TENS OF THOUSANDS OF
DOLLARS ALL BECAUSE THEY BELIEVED DONALD TRUMP. CHARITY AFTER CHARITY BELIEVED
DONALD TRUMP WHEN HE SAID THEY
WOULD CONTRIBUTE TO THAT. THOUSANDS OF TRUMP UNIVERSITY STUDENTS LEAVE -- BELIEVED DONALD TRUMP WHEN HE SAID HE
WOULD HELP THEM SUCCEED. THEY GOT STIFFED.
>> BOO!
>> HE SAYS BELIEVE ME, HIS CREDITORS, HIS CONTRACTORS, HIS
LAID OFF EMPLOYEES, AND HIS RIPPED OFF STUDENTS DID JUST
THAT AND THEY ALL GOT HURT. FOLKS, YOU CANNOT BELIEVE ONE WORD THAT COMES OUT OF DONALD TRUMP'S MOUTH [CHEERS]
.
[CHEERS] NOT ONE WORD. NOT ONE WORD.
[CHEERS] NOT ONE WORD.
>> NOT ONE WORD. NOT ONE WORD.
>> I WILL TELL YOU. TO ME, IT SEEMS LIKE OUR NATION PROMISING SELF-PROMOTING ONE-MAN
WRECKING CREW.
[CHEERS] BUT DON'T TAKE IT FROM ME, DON'T
TAKE IT FROM ME. TAKE IT FROM FORMER FIRST LADY
BARBARA BUSH. BARBARA BUSH SAYS SHE DOES NOT
KNOW HOW ANY WOMAN COULD VOTE
FOR HIM AFTER HIS OFFENSIVE COMMENTS TO WOMEN.
[CHEERS] ANY WOMAN. OR JOHN MCCAIN'S CHIEF ECONOMIC
ADVISER DURING THE 2008 RACE WHO ESTIMATES THAT DONALD TRUMP'S PROMISES WOULD COST AMERICA TO LOSE 3.5 MILLION JOBS. OR THE INDEPENDENT ANALYSTS WHO
FOUND THAT DONALD TRUMP TAX PLAN
GIVEN TO THE WEALTHY AND BIGGEST CORPORATIONS WOULD RACK UP $30
TRILLION IN DEBT.
OR HOW ABOUT THIS? JOHN KASICH, THE REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR OF WHO HAD THE HONOR
OF HOSTING THE REPUBLICAN
CONVENTION IN CLEVELAND, BUT
WOULD NOT ATTEND BECAUSE HE
THINKS DONALD TRUMP IS SUCH A MORAL DISASTER.
[CHEERS] OR TAKE IT FROM THE GUY WHO COWROTE DONALD TRUMP'S AUTOBIOGRAPHY, HERE IS WHAT HE
SAID ABOUT DONALD TRUMP. LYING IS SECOND NATURE TO HIM. SO DO YOU BELIEVE HIM?
>> NO!
>> HOW ABOUT THE SIDE, DO YOU
BELIEVE HIM?
>> NO!!
>> IS THERE ANYONE IN THIS OLD AND WHO BELIEVES THEM?!  -- HIM?
>> NO!
>> THE NEXT PRESIDENT WILL FACE
MANY CHALLENGES, WE BETTER ELECT
A CANDIDATE WHO HAS PROVEN SHE
CAN BE TRUSTED WITH THE JOB.
[CHEERS] THE CANDIDATE WHO HAS PROVEN
THAT SHE IS READY FOR THE JOB AND WHEN I SAY READY, I USE
READY FOR A SPECIFIC REASON. WHEN I LIVED IN HONDURAS, I
LEARNED SOMETHING.
THE BEST COMPLEMENT YOU COULD
PAY TO SOMEBODY WAS TO SAY THAT THEY WERE LISTO. READY. NOT INTELIGENTE, AMABLE, RICO. BUT LISTO BECAUSE IN SPANISH IT MEANS PREPARED, UP FOR
ANYTHING, NEVER BACKING DOWN. FRIENDS, HILLARY CLINTON IS
LISTA!
[CHEERS] SHE IS READY.
[CHEERS] SHE'S READY BECAUSE OF HER
FAITH, BECAUSE OF HER HEART, SHE
IS READY BECAUSE OF HER EXPERIENCE AND SHE IS READY
BECAUSE SHE KNOWS THAT IN
AMERICA, WE ARE STRONGER WHEN WE
ARE TOGETHER.
[CHEERS] MY FELLOW DEMOCRATS, THIS WEEK WE START THE NEXT CHAPTER IN OUR GREAT AND PROUD STORY. THOMAS DISCLAIMED ALL MEN WERE EQUAL AND ABIGAIL REMEMBER THE
WOMEN. WOODROW BROKERED THE PEACE AND
ELEANOR BROKE DOWN THE BARRIER. JACK TOLD US WHAT TO ASK AND LYNDON ANSWER THE CALL.
MARTIN HAD A DREAM AND DOLORES SAID SI SE PUEDE. BILL BUILT A BRIDGE INTO THE 21ST CENTURY AND BRCA BUZZ HOPE AND NOW -- BARACK GAVE US HOPE AND HILLARY IS READY TO FIGHT
AND WIN. GOD WAS ALL THE AND ONTO VICTORY.
[CHEERS] THANK YOU, PHILADELPHIA!

<strong>Sharon Belkofer</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> HELLO, OHIO!
[CHEERS] YOU ARE ALL PROBABLY WONDERING WHO THE HECK IS THIS LITTLE OLD LADY.
[LAUGHTER] I AM A MOM TO THREE BOYS WHO
SERVED THEIR COUNTRY.
[CHEERS]<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> A RETIRED NURSE AND A WIFE OF 52 YEARS, A GRANDMA OF 10 AND NOW A
GREAT GRANDMA.
[CHEERS] I KNOW THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS
MEANT SO MUCH TO MILLIONS OF AMERICANS ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY
I WOULD LIKE TO TELL YOU WHAT HE
MEANS TO ME. SIX YEARS AGO, ON THE MORNING OF
MAY 18, 2010, I BECAME A GOLD STAR MOTHER. WE BEGIN A GOLD STAR FAMILY WHEN MY SON, LIEUTENANT COLONEL, WAS
KILLED IN AFGHANISTAN.
I FIRST MET THE SENATE -- PRESIDENT SHORTLY AFTER. HE WAS SCHEDULED TO SPEAK TO THE
MOUNTAIN DIVISION.
BUT WHEN HE HEARD THE GOLD STAR FAMILIES WERE THERE, HE WANTED
TO MEET WITH US. AS HE WAS HUGGING ME, I CRIED
OLIVER HIS SUIT.
-- ALL OVER HIS SUIT. TOM WOULD HAVE BEEN SO
EMBARRASSED.
IT MUST HAVE BEEN OK BECAUSE A YEAR LATER, AT AN EVENT IN MY
HOME STATE OF OHIO, --
[CHEERS] AS I HOPE TO GET A PICTURE SIDE, SOMEONE TOLD ME THE PRESIDENT WO ULD LIKE TO SEE YOU AND I GOT MY SECOND PRESIDENTIAL HUG.
[CHEERS] SO WARM AND KIND, SOME
COMPASSIONATE -- SO COMPASSIONATE.
I WAS SO INSPIRED. MAYBE THIS SWEET OLD LADY COULD
STILL MAKE A DIFFERENCE. I KNEW MY COMMUNITY SCHOOLS
NEEDED MORE RESOURCES SO AT THE AGE OF 73, I TOOK A LEAP OF FAITH AND RAN FOR MY LOCAL
SCHOOL BOARD.
[CHEERS] AND WHEN MY BACK WAS BOTHERING ME, AND I DID NOT FEEL LIKE
KNOCKING ON DOORS, WHEN THE WIND WAS BLOWING AND IT WAS COLD AND DREARY, I THOUGHT OF MY SON
NEVER GAVE UP AND I THOUGHT OF OUR PRESIDENT, HE NEVER GIVES UP.
[CHEERS] SO WHY SHOULD I, WHY SHOULD I BE
DIFFERENT? BESIDES, THEY TELL ME, WALKING
IS GOOD FOR YOUR BACK. GUESS WHAT, I WANT MY ELECTION
-- WON THE ELECTION.
[CHEERS] I WON BIG.
[CHEERS] THE PRESIDENT EVEN SENT ME A HANDWRITTEN NOTE OF
CONGRATULATIONS. THAT IS WHO HE IS. NO MATTER HOW BUSY, HE HAS NEVER
FORGOTTEN THIS LITTLE OLD LADY
IN OHIO WHO HAS ALWAYS HAD HIS
BACK.
[CHEERS] YOU SEE, SOME PEOPLE IN THIS
WORLD MAKE BIG DIFFERENCES. MY SON MADE BIG DIFFERENCES. THE PRESIDENT CONTINUES TO MAKE BIG DIFFERENCES. AND THE SMALLER ONES, TOO, LIKE INSPIRATION HE POURED INTO ME SO THAT I MIGHT MAKE A DIFFERENCE OF MY OWN.
[CHEERS] I WISH EVERY AMERICAN COULD HUG PRESIDENT OBAMA.
[CHEERS] SO THAT THEY COULD SEE THE GOOD
IN HIS EYES AND FEEL THE WARMTH
IN HIS HEART.
[CHEERS] THIS IS OUR PRESIDENT.

[CHEERS] THANK YOU. THANK YOU.
[CHEERS] THANK YOU.
[CHEERS] THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU, EVERYBODY.
[CHEERS] THANK YOU SO<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> MUCH, EVERYBODY.
[CHEERS]
>> YES WE DID. YES WE DID. PRESIDENT OBAMA: THANK YOU.
[CHEERS] THANK YOU SO MUCH, EVERYBODY.
[CHEERS] I LOVE YOU BACK.
[CHEERS] HELLO, AMERICA. HELLO, DEMOCRATS. 12 YEARS AGO, TONIGHT. I ADDRESSED THIS CONVENTION FOR
THE VERY FIRST TIME. YOU MET MY TWO LITTLE GIRLS. NOW TO AMAZING YOUNG WOMEN WHO
FILL ME WITH PRIDE.
[CHEERS] YOU FELL FROM A BRILLIANT WHITE
AND PARTNER, MICHELLE.
[CHEERS] WHO HAS MADE ME A BETTER FATHER
AND A BETTER MAN.
WHO HAS GONE ON TO INSPIRE OUR
NATION AND FIRST LADY.
[CHEERS] AND WHO SOMEHOW HAS NOT AGED
DAY.
[CHEERS] THE SAME CANNOT BE SAID FOR ME.
[LAUGHTER] MY GIRLS REMIND ME ALL THE TIME. YOU'VE CHANGED SO MUCH, THAT IT. THEN THEY -- DADDY. THEN THEY TRY TO CLEAN IT UP,
NOT BAD, JUST MORE MATURE.
[LAUGHTER] AND IT IS TRUE. I WAS SO YOUNG THAT FIRST TIME.
[CHEERS] AND LOOK, I WILL ADMIT, MAYBE I
WAS A LITTLE NERVOUS. ADDRESSING SUCH A CROWD. BUT I WAS FILLED WITH FAITH.
[CHEERS] FAITH IN AMERICA. THE GENEROUS, BIGHEARTED, HOPEFUL COUNTRY THAT MADE MY STORY, THAT MADE ALL OF OUR
STORIES POSSIBLE. A LOT HAS HAPPENED OVER THE
YEARS. WHILE THIS NATION HAS BEEN
TESTED BY WAR AND IT HAS BEEN
TESTED BY RECESSION AND ALL
MANNER OF CHALLENGES, I STAND
BEFORE YOU AGAIN TONIGHT AFTER
ALMOST TWO TERMS AS YOUR PRESIDENT TO TELL YOU I AM MORE
OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THE FUTURE OF AMERICA THAN EVER BEFORE.
[CHEERS] HOW COULD I NOT BE? AFTER ALL THAT WE HAVE ACHIEVED
TOGETHER. AFTER THE WORST RECESSION IN 80 YEARS.
WE FOUGHT OUR WAY BACK.
WE HAVE SEEN DEFICITS COME DOWN.
401(K)S RECOVERED. AUTO INDUSTRY SET A RECORD. UNEMPLOYMENT REACHED A YEAR LOWS AND BUSINESSES CREATE MORE THAN 50 MILLION NEW JOBS.
[CHEERS] AFTER A CENTURY OF TRYING, WE DECLARED HEALTH CARE IN AMERICA IS NOT A PRIVILEGE FOR A FEW, IT
IS A RIGHT FOR EVERYBODY.
[CHEERS] AFTER DECADES OF TALK, WE FEEL
HE BEGAN TO WAEN OURSELVES OFF
OF FOREIGN OIL. WE DOUBLED OUR PRODUCTION OF CLEAN ENERGY.
[CHEERS] WE BROUGHT MORE OF OUR TROOPS
HOME TO THEIR FAMILIES.
AND WE DELIVER JUSTICE TO OSAMA
BIN LADEN.
[CHEERS] THROUGH DIPLOMACY, WE SHUT DOWN IRAN'S NUCLEAR WEAPONS PROGRAM. WE OPENED UP A NEW CHAPTER WITH
THE PEOPLE OF CUBA. BROUGHT NEARLY 200 NATIONS
TOGETHER AROUND THE CLIMATE AGREEMENT THAT CONTAINS -- COULD
SAY THIS PLANET FOR OUR
CHILDREN.
-- SAVE THIS PLANET FOR OUR
CHILDREN.
[CHEERS] WE PUT POLICIES IN PLACE TO HELP LOANS. CUT VETERANS HOMELESSNESS IN
HALF. ANN CALLIS ASK OF QUIET COURAGE,
-- AND THROUGH COUNTLESS ACT
OF QUIET COURAGE, WE HAVE MADE
MARRIAGE EQUALITY AND THE LAW OF
THE LAND.
[CHEERS] BY SO MANY MEASURES, OUR COUNTRY IS STRONGER AND MORE PROSPEROUS
THAN IT WAS WHEN WE FIRST STARTED. ANSWER EVERY VICTORY, AND EVERY SETBACK, I'VE INSISTED THAT
CHANGE IS NEVER EASY. NEVER QUIT. WE WOULD NOT MEET ALL OF OUR
CHALLENGES AND ONE TERM OR ONE
PRESIDENCY. OR EVEN ONE LIFETIME. TONIGHT, I'M HERE TO TELL YOU THAT TONIGHT, WE STILL HAVE MORE
WORK TO DO MORE WORK TO DO FOR EVERY AMERICAN IN NEED OF A GOOD
JOB. PAID LEAVE FOR DECENT
RETIREMENT. FOR EVERY CHILD WHO NEEDS A
LADDER OUT OF POVERTY OR WORLD-CLASS EDUCATION. FOR EVERYONE WHO IS NOT YET FELT THE PROGRESS OF THESE PAST SEVEN AND HALF YEARS. WE NEED TO KEEP MAKING OUR STREETS SAFER IN OUR CRIMINAL
JUSTICE SYSTEM FAIR.
[CHEERS] OUR HOMELAND MORE SECURE, OUR
WORLD MORE PEACEFUL AND
SUSTAINABLE FOR THE NEXT GENERATION.
[CHEERS]
WE ARE NOT DONE PROTECTING OUR
UNION. LIVING UP TO OUR FOUNDING.
-- FOUNDING CREED THAT ALL OF US ARE CREATED EQUAL AND ALL OF US
ARE FREE IN THE EYES OF GOD.
[CHEERS] THAT WORK INVOLVES A BIG CHOICE THIS NOVEMBER. I THINK IT IS FAIR TO SAY THAT
THIS IS NOT YOUR TYPICAL ELECTION.
[LAUGHTER] IT IS NOT JUST A CHOICE BETWEEN PARTIES OR POLICIES, THE USUAL DEBATES BETWEEN LEFT AND RIGHT. THIS IS A MORE FUNDAMENTAL CHOICE. ABOUT WHO WE ARE AS A PEOPLE. AND WHETHER WE STAY TRUE TO THIS
GREAT AMERICAN EXPERIENCE -- EXPERIMENT AND GOVERNMENT. LOOK, WE DEMOCRATS HAVE ALWAYS
HAD PLENTY OF DIFFERENCES WITH
THE REPUBLICAN PARTY.
AND THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH
THAT. IT IS PRECISELY THIS CONTEST OF IDEAS THAT PUSHES OUR COUNTRY
FORWARD.
[CHEERS] BUT WE HEARD IN CLEVELAND LAST WEEK WAS NOT PARTICULARLY
REPUBLICAN. AND IT SURE WASN'T CONSERVATIVE. WHAT WE HEARD WAS A DEEPLY AS A MYSTIC VISION OF A COUNTRY WHERE RETURN AGAINST EACH OTHER IN
TURN AWAY FROM THE REST OF THE
WORLD.
THERE WERE NO SERIOUS SOLUTIONS
TO PRESSING PROBLEMS. JUST THE THINNING OF RESENTMENT AND BLAME AND ANGER AND THAT IS
NOT THE AMERICA I KNOW. THE AMERICA I KNOW IS FULL OF
COURAGE AND OPTIMISM AND
INGENUITY. THE AMERICAN I KNOW IS DECENT AND GENEROUS SURE WE HAVE REAL ANXIETIES ABOUT PAYING BILLS AND
PROTECTING OUR KIDS. WE GET FRUSTRATED WITH POLITICAL GRIDLOCK AND WORRY ABOUT RACIAL DIVISION. WE ARE SHOCKED AND SADDENED BY THE MADNESS OF ORLANDO OR NICE. THERE ARE POCKETS OF AMERICA
THAT NEVER RECOVERED FROM FACTORY CLOSURES. MANY TOOK PRIDE AND HARD WORK AND PROVIDED FOR THE FAMILIES
WHO NOW FEEL FORGOTTEN. PARENTS WHO WONDER WHETHER KIDS
WILL HAVE THE SAME OPPORTUNITIES
THAT WE HAD. ALL THAT ISRAEL. WE'RE CHALLENGED TO DO BETTER;
TO BE BETTER. BUT AS I'VE TRAVELED THIS COUNTRY, THROUGH ALL FIFTY
STATES; AS I'VE REJOICED WITH
YOU AND MOURNED WITH YOU, WHAT
I'VE ALSO SEEN, MORE THAN
ANYTHING, IS WHAT IS RIGHT WITH
AMERICA.
[CHEERS] I SEE PEOPLE WORKING HARD AND
STARTING BUSINESSES; PEOPLE
TEACHING KIDS AND SERVING OUR
COUNTRY. I SEE ENGINEERS INVENTING STUFF,
AND DOCTORS COMING UP WITH NEW CURES. I SEE A YOUNGER GENERATION FULL OF ENERGY AND NEW IDEAS, NOT
CONSTRAINED BY WHAT IS, READY TO
SEIZE WHAT OUGHT TO BE.
[CHEERS] MOST OF ALL, I SEE AMERICANS OF
EVERY PARTY, EVERY BACKGROUND,
EVERY FAITH WHO BELIEVE THAT WE
ARE STRONGER TOGETHER.
BLACK, WHITE, LATINO, ASIAN, NATIVE AMERICAN; YOUNG AND OLD;
GAY, STRAIGHT, MEN, WOMEN, FOLKS
WITH DISABILITIES, ALL PLEDGING ALLEGIANCE, UNDER THE SAME PROUD FLAG, TO THIS BIG, BOLD COUNTRY THAT WE LOVE.
[CHEERS] THAT IS WHAT I SEE.
THAT IS THE AMERICA I KNOW.
[CHEERS] AND THERE IS ONLY ONE CANDIDATE IN THIS RACE WHO BELIEVES IN THAT FUTURE, AND HAS DEVOTED HER LIFE TO IT; A MOTHER AND
GRANDMOTHER WHO'D DO ANYTHING TO HELP OUR CHILDREN THRIVE; A
LEADER WITH REAL PLANS TO BREAK
DOWN BARRIERS, BLAST THROUGH
GLASS CEILINGS, AND WIDEN THE
CIRCLE OF OPPORTUNITY TO EVERY SINGLE AMERICAN, THE NEXT
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, HILLARY CLINTON.
[CHEERS]
>> HILLARY.
HILLARY. HILLARY. PRESIDENT OBAMA: THAT IS RIGHT. LET ME TELL YOU, NOW, EIGHT
YEARS AGO, HILLARY AND I WERE
RIVALS FOR THE DEMOCRATIC
NOMINATION. WE BATTLED FOR A YEAR AND A HALF. LET ME TELL YOU, IT WAS TOUGH, BECAUSE HILLARY'S TOP. I WAS WORN OUT.
[LAUGHTER] SHE WAS DOING EVERYTHING I WAS DOING, BUT IT WAS TOUGH.
[CHEERS] EVERY TIME I THOUGHT I MIGHT
HAVE THAT RACE WON, HILLARY JUST
CAME BACK STRONGER. BUT AFTER IT WAS ALL OVER, I
ASKED HILLARY TO JOIN MY TEAM. SHE WAS A LITTLE SURPRISED, BUT ULTIMATELY SAID YES  BECAUSE SHE KNEW THAT WHAT WAS AT STAKE WAS BIGGER THAN EITHER OF US. AND AND FOR FOUR YEARS, I HAD A
FRONT ROW SEAT TO HER INTELLIGENCE, HER JUDGMENT, AND
HER DISCIPLINE. I CAME TO REALIZE THAT HER
UNBELIEVABLE WORK ETHIC WASN'T
FOR PRAISE OR ATTENTION, THAT
SHE WAS IN THIS FOR EVERYONE WHO NEEDS A CHAMPION.
[CHEERS] I UNDERSTOOD THAT AFTER ALL
THESE YEARS, SHE HAS NEVER
FORGOTTEN JUST WHO SHE'S
FIGHTING FOR. HILLARY'S STILL GOT THE TENACITY SHE HAD AS A YOUNG WOMAN WORKING
AT THE CHILDREN'S DEFENSE FUND,
GOING DOOR TO DOOR TO ULTIMATELY
MAKE SURE KIDS WITH DISABILITIES
COULD GET A QUALITY EDUCATION.
[CHEERS] SHE'S STILL GOT THE HEART SHE
SHOWED AS OUR FIRST LADY,
WORKING WITH CONGRESS TO HELP
PUSH THROUGH A CHILDREN'S HEALTH
INSURANCE PROGRAM THAT TO THIS
DAY PROTECTS MILLIONS OF KIDS.
[CHEERS] SHE'S STILL SEARED WITH THE MEMORY OF EVERY AMERICAN SHE MET WHO LOST LOVED ONES ON 9/11, WHICH IS WHY, AS A SENATOR FROM
NEW YORK, SHE FOUGHT SO HARD FOR FUNDING TO HELP FIRST RESPONDERS, TO HELP THE CITY REBUILD WHY, AS SECRETARY OF
, STATE, SHE SAT WITH ME IN THE SITUATION ROOM AND FORCEFULLY ARGUED IN FAVOR OF THE MISSION THAT TOOK OUT BIN LADEN.
[CHEERS] YOU KNOW, NOTHING TRULY PREPARES
YOU FOR THE DEMANDS OF THE OVAL
OFFICE. YOU CAN READ ABOUT IT, YOU CAN STUDY IT. UNTIL YOU HAVE SET AT THE DESK,
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO
MANAGE A GLOBAL CRISIS, OR SEND YOUNG PEOPLE TO WAR. BUT HILLARY'S BEEN IN THE ROOM;
SHE'S BEEN PART OF THOSE
DECISIONS. SHE KNOWS WHAT'S AT STAKE IN THE DECISIONS OUR GOVERNMENT MAKES
FOR THE WORKING FAMILY, THE
SENIOR CITIZEN, THE SMALL
BUSINESS OWNER, THE SOLDIER, AND
THE VETERAN. EVEN IN THE MIDST OF CRISIS, SHE
LISTENS TO PEOPLE, AND KEEPS HER
COOL, AND TREATS EVERYBODY WITH
RESPECT. AND NO MATTER HOW DAUNTING THE
ODDS; NO MATTER HOW MUCH PEOPLE
TRY TO KNOCK HER DOWN, SHE NEVER, EVER POINTS.
[CHEERS]
-- QUITS.
[CHEERS] THAT'S THE HILLARY I KNOW. THAT'S THE HILLARY I'VE COME TO ADMIRE. AND THAT'S WHY I CAN SAY WITH CONFIDENCE THERE HAS NEVER BEEN A MAN OR A WOMAN MORE QUALIFIED THAN HILLARY CLINTON TO SERVE AS
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.
[CHEERS] I HOPE YOU DON'T MIND BILL, BUT
I WAS JUST FIND THE TRUTH.
AND, BY THE WAY, IN CASE YOU
WERE WONDERING ABOUT HER
JUDGMENT, LOOK AT HER CHOICE OF
RUNNING MATE.
[CHEERS] TIM KAINE IS AS GOOD A MAN, AS
HUMBLE AND COMMITTED A PUBLIC SERVANT AS ANYONE I KNOW. I KNOW HIS FAMILY AND I LOVE HIS
WIFE AND HIS KIDS.
HE WILL BE A GREAT VICE
PRESIDENT, AND HE'LL MAKE
HILLARY A BETTER PRESIDENT. JUST
LIKE MY DEAR FRIEND AND BROTHER JOE BIDEN HAS MADE ME A BETTER
PRESIDENT.
[CHEERS] NOW, HILLARY HAS REAL PLANS TO
ADDRESS THE CONCERNS SHE'S HEARD
FROM YOU ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL.
SHE'S GOT SPECIFIC IDEAS TO INVEST IN NEW JOBS, TO HELP
WORKERS SHARE IN THEIR COMPANY'S PROFITS, TO HELP PUT KIDS IN PRESCHOOL, AND PUT STUDENTS THROUGH COLLEGE WITHOUT TAKING ON A TENANT THAT.
-- TON OF DEBT. THAT'S WHAT LEADERS DO. AND THEN THERE'S DONALD TRUMP.
>> BOO! PRESIDENT OBAMA: DON'T BOO, V OTE. THE DONALD IS NOT REALLY A PLANS
GUY.
[LAUGHTER] HE IS NOT REALLY A FAX GUY
EITHER. HE CALLS HIMSELF A BUSINESS GUY, WHICH IS TRUE, BUT I HAVE TO SAY, I KNOW PLENTY OF BUSINESSMEN AND WOMEN WHO'VE ACHIEVED SUCCESS WITHOUT LEAVING A TRAIL OF LAWSUITS, AND UNPAID WORKERS, AND PEOPLE FEELING LIKE THEY GOT CHEATED.
[CHEERS] DOES ANYONE REALLY BELIEVE THAT
A GUY WHO'S SPENT HIS 70 YEARS
ON THIS EARTH SHOWING NO REGARD
FOR WORKING PEOPLE IS SUDDENLY
GOING TO BE A CHAMPION? YOUR VOICE? IF SO, YOU SHOULD VOTE FOR HIM. BUT IF YOU'RE SOMEONE WHO'S
TRULY CONCERNED ABOUT PAYING
YOUR BILLS, AND YOU ARE
CONCERNED ABOUT POCKET BUSH -- POCKETBOOK ISSUES AND SCENIC ECONOMY GROWTH AND CREATING MORE
OPPORTUNITY FOR EVERYBODY, THEN THE CHOICE ISN'T EVEN CLOSE. IF IF YOU WANT SOMEONE WITH A
LIFELONG TRACK RECORD OF
FIGHTING FOR HIGHER WAGES,
BETTER BENEFITS, A FAIRER TAX
CODE, A BIGGER VOICE FOR
WORKERS, AND STRONGER
REGULATIONS ON WALL STREET, THEN
YOU SHOULD VOTE FOR HILLARY
CLINTON.
[CHEERS] AND IF YOU'RE CONCERNED ABOUT
WHO'S GOING TO KEEP YOU AND YOUR
FAMILY SAFE IN A DANGEROUS WORLD
, WELL, THE CHOICE IS EVEN
CLEARER. HILLARY CLINTON IS RESPECTED AROUND THE WORLD NOT JUST BY
LEADERS, BUT BY THE PEOPLE THEY
SERVE. I HAVE TO SAY THIS, PEOPLE OUTSIDE OF THE END -- UNITED STATES DO NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT IS
GOING ON IN THIS ELECTION.
[LAUGHTER] THEY REALLY DON'T. THEY KNOW HILLARY.
THEY HAVE SEEN HER WORK. SHE'S WORKED CLOSELY WITH OUR INTELLIGENCE TEAMS, OUR DIPLOMATS, OUR MILITARY.
SHE HAS THE JUDGMENT, THE EXPERIENCE, AND THE TEMPERAMENT TO MEET THE THREAT FROM TERRORISM.
IT IS NOT NEW TO HER.
OUR TROOPS HAVE POUNDED ISIL WITHOUT MERCY, TAKING OUT
LEADERS, TAKING BACK TERRITORY. I KNOW HILLARY WON'T RELENT
UNTIL ISIL IS DESTROYED. SHE'LL
FINISH THE JOB.
[CHEERS] AND SHE'LL DO IT WITHOUT
RESORTING TO TORTURE, OR BANNING
ENTIRE RELIGIONS FROM ENTERING
OUR COUNTRY. SHE IS FIT TO BE THE NEXT COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF.
[CHEERS] MEANWHILE, DONALD TRUMP CALLS
OUR MILITARY AND DISASTER.
-- A DISASTER. APPARENTLY, HE DOESN'T KNOW THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO MAKE UP THE
STRONGEST FIGHTING FORCE THE
WORLD HAS EVER KNOWN.
[CHEERS] HE SUGGESTS AMERICA IS WEAK. HE
MUST NOT HEAR THE BILLIONS OF
MEN, WOMEN, AND CHILDREN, FROM
THE BALTICS TO BURMA, WHO STILL
LOOK TO AMERICA TO BE THE LIGHT
OF FREEDOM, DIGNITY, AND HUMAN RIGHTS.
[CHEERS] HE COZIES UP TO PUTIN, PRAISES
SADDAM HUSSEIN, AND TELLS THE
NATO ALLIES THAT STOOD BY OUR
SIDE AFTER 9/11 THAT THEY HAVE
TO PAY UP IF THEY WANT OUR PROTECTION. WELL, AMERICA'S PROMISES DO NOT
COME WITH A PRICE TAG.
WE MEET OUR COMMITMENTS. AND AND THAT'S ONE REASON WHY ALMOST EVERY COUNTRY ON EARTH SEES AMERICA AS STRONGER AND MORE RESPECTED TODAY THAN THEY DID EIGHT YEARS AGO WHEN I TOOK
OFFICE.
[CHEERS] AMERICA IS ALREADY GREAT.
[CHEERS] AMERICA IS ALREADY STRONG.
[CHEERS] AND I PROMISE YOU, OUR STRENGTH, OUR GREATNESS, DOES NOT DEPEND ON DONALD TRUMP. IN FACT, IT DOESN'T DEPEND ON ANY ONE PERSON.
AND THAT, IN THE END, MAY BE THE
BIGGEST DIFFERENCE IN THIS
ELECTION THE MEANING OF OUR
, DEMOCRACY. RONALD REAGAN CALLED AMERICA "A SHINING CITY ON A HILL." DONALD
TRUMP CALLS IT "A DIVIDED CRIME
SCENE" THAT ONLY HE CAN FIX. IT IT DOESN'T MATTER TO HIM THAT
ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION AND THE
CRIME RATE ARE AS LOW AS THEY'VE
BEEN IN DECADES, BECAUSE HE'S NOT ACTUALLY OFFERING ANY REAL SOLUTION TO THOSE ISSUES. HE'S JUST OFFERING SLOGANS, AND HE'S OFFERING FAIR. HE'S BETTING THAT IF HE SCARES ENOUGH PEOPLE, HE MIGHT SCORE
JUST ENOUGH VOTES TO WIN THIS ELECTION. THAT IS ANOTHER BET THAT DONALD TRUMP WILL LOSE. THE REASON HE WILL LOSE IT IS BECAUSE HE'S SELLING THE AMERICAN PEOPLE SHORT.
WE ARE NOT A FRAGILE OR PRIDEFUL PEOPLE.
OUR POWER DOESN'T COME FROM SOME SELF-DECLARED SAVIOR PROMISING THAT HE ALONE CAN RESTORE ORDER. AS LONG AS WE DO THINGS HIS WAY.
WE DON'T LOOK TO BE ROLLED.
-- RULED.
[CHEERS] OUR POWER COMES FROM THOSE
IMMORTAL DECLARATIONS FIRST PUT
TO PAPER RIGHT HERE IN
PHILADELPHIA ALL THOSE YEARS
AGO; WE HOLD THESE TRUTHS TO BE
SELF-EVIDENT, THAT ALL MEN ARE
CREATED EQUAL; THAT TOGETHER,
WE, THE PEOPLE, CAN FORM A MORE PERFECT UNION.
[CHEERS] THAT'S WHO WE ARE. THAT'S OUR BIRTHRIGHT. THE CAPACITY TO SHAPE OUR OWN DESTINY.
[CHEERS] THAT'S WHAT DROVE PATRIOTS TO
CHOOSE REVOLUTION OVER TYRANNY
AND OUR GIS TO LIBERATE A
CONTINENT. IT'S WHAT GAVE WOMEN THE COURAGE TO REACH FOR THE BALLOT, AND
MARCHERS TO CROSS A BRIDGE IN
SELMA, AND WORKERS TO ORGANIZE
AND FIGHT FOR BETTER WAGES.
[CHEERS] AMERICA HAS NEVER BEEN ABOUT
WHAT ONE PERSON SAYS HE'LL DO
FOR US. IT'S ABOUT WHAT CAN BE ACHIEVED BY US, TOGETHER, THROUGH THE
HARD, SLOW, SOMETIMES FRUSTRATING, BUT ULTIMATELY ENDURING WORK OF SELF-GOVERNMENT.
AND THAT'S WHAT HILLARY CLINTON UNDERSTANDS.
[CHEERS] SHE KNOWS THAT THIS IS A BIG, DIVERSE COUNTRY, SHE HAS SEEN IT. SHE UNDERSTANDS THAT MOST ISSUES
ARE RARELY BLACK AND WHITE. SHE UNDERSTANDS THAT EVEN WHEN YOU'RE 100% RIGHT GETTING THINGS
, DONE REQUIRES COPPER MINES.
THAT DEMOCRACY DOESN'T WORK IF WE CONSTANTLY DEMONIZE EACH OTHER.
[CHEERS] SHE KNOWS THAT FOR PROGRESS TO
HAPPEN, WE HAVE TO LISTEN TO
EACH OTHER, SEE OURSELVES IN
EACH OTHER, FIGHT FOR OUR
PRINCIPLES BUT ALSO FIGHT TO
FIND COMMON GROUND, NO MATTER
HOW ELUSIVE THAT MAY SEEM.
[CHEERS] HILLARY KNOWS WE CAN WORK
THROUGH RACIAL DIVIDES IN THIS
COUNTRY WHEN WE REALIZE THE
WORRY BLACK PARENTS FEEL WHEN
THEIR SON LEAVES THE HOUSE ISN'T
SO DIFFERENT THAN WHAT A BRAVE
COP'S FAMILY FEELS WHEN HE PUTS
ON THE BLUE AND GOES TO WORK;
THAT WE CAN HONOR POLICE AND
TREAT EVERY COMMUNITY FAIRLY.

[CHEERS] SHE KNOWS THAT ACKNOWLEDGING PROBLEMS THAT HAVE FESTERED FOR
DECADES ISN'T MAKING RACE RELATIONS WORSE, IT'S CREATING
THE POSSIBILITY FOR PEOPLE OF GOOD WILL TO JOIN AND MAKE
THINGS BETTER.
[CHEERS] HILLARY KNOWS WE CAN INSIST ON A LAWFUL AND ORDERLY IMMIGRATION SYSTEM WHILE STILL SEEING STRIVING STUDENTS AND THEIR TOILING PARENTS AS LOVING FAMILIES, NOT CRIMINALS OR RAPISTS; FAMILIES THAT CAME HERE FOR THE SAME REASONS OUR FOREBEARS CAME, TO WORK, AND STUDY, AND MAKE A BETTER LIFE, IN A PLACE WHERE WE CAN TALK AND
WORSHIP AND LOVE AS WE PLEASE. SHE KNOWS THEIR DREAM IS QUINTESSENTIALLY AMERICAN, AND
THE AMERICAN DREAM IS SOMETHING
NO WALL WILL EVER CONTAIN.
[CHEERS] THESE ARE THE THINGS HILLARY
KNOWS.
IT CAN BE FRUSTRATING, THIS BUSINESS OF DEMOCRACY. TRUST ME, I KNOW. HILLARY KNOWS, TOO. WHEN THE OTHER SIDE REFUSES TO
COMPROMISE, PROGRESS CAN STALL. PEOPLE ARE HURT BY INACTION. SUPPORTERS CAN GROW IMPATIENT, AND WORRY THAT YOU'RE NOT TRYING
HARD ENOUGH; THAT YOU'VE MAYBE
SOLD OUT.
BUT I PROMISE YOU, WHEN WE KEEP
AT IT; WHEN WE CHANGE ENOUGH MINDS; WHEN WE DELIVER ENOUGH VOTES, THEN PROGRESS DOES HAPPEN. JUST ASK THE 20 MILLION MORE
PEOPLE WHO HAVE HEALTH CARE
TODAY.
[CHEERS] JUST ASK THE MARINE WHO PROUDLY SERVES HIS COUNTRY WITHOUT HIDING THE HUSBAND HE LOVES.

[CHEERS] DEMOCRACY WORKS, BUT WE GOTTA WANTED, NOT JUST DURING AN
ELECTION YEAR, BUT ALL THE DAYS IN BETWEEN.
[CHEERS] SO IF YOU AGREE THAT THERE'S TOO
MUCH INEQUALITY IN OUR ECONOMY,
AND TOO MUCH MONEY IN OUR
POLITICS, WE ALL NEED TO BE AS
VOCAL AND AS ORGANIZED AND AS
PERSISTENT AS BERNIE SANDERS'
SUPPORTERS HAVE BEEN DURING THE
SELECTION.
[CHEERS]
-- THIS ELECTION.
[CHEERS] WE ALL NEED TO GET OUT AND VOTE
FOR DEMOCRATS UP AND DOWN THE
TICKET, AND THEN HOLD THEM
ACCOUNTABLE UNTIL THEY GET THE
JOB DONE.
[CHEERS] THAT'S RIGHT. FEEL THE BERN!
[CHEERS] IF YOU WANT MORE JUSTICE IN THE
JUSTICE SYSTEM, THEN WE'VE ALL
GOT TO VOTE NOT JUST FOR A
PRESIDENT, BUT FOR MAYORS, AND SHERIFFS, AND STATE'S ATTORNEYS, AND STATE LEGISLATORS. THAT IS WHERE THE CRIMINAL LAWS ARE MADE AND WE'VE GOT TO WORK
WITH POLICE AND PROTESTERS UNTIL LAWS AND PRACTICES ARE CHANGED.
[CHEERS] THAT IS HOW DEMOCRACY WORKS. IF YOU WANT TO FIGHT CLIMATE CHANGE, WE'VE GOT TO ENGAGE NOT ONLY YOUNG PEOPLE ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES, BUT REACH OUT TO THE COAL MINER WHO'S WORRIED ABOUT TAKING CARE OF HIS FAMILY, THE SINGLE MOM WORRIED ABOUT GAS PRICES.
[CHEERS] IF YOU WANT TO PROTECT OUR KIDS AND OUR COPS FROM GUN VIOLENCE, WE'VE GOT TO GET THE VAST
MAJORITY OF AMERICANS, INCLUDING
GUN OWNERS, WHO AGREE ON
BACKGROUND CHECKS TO BE JUST AS
VOCAL AND DETERMINED AS THE GUN
LOBBY THAT BLOCKS CHANGE THROUGH EVERY FUNERAL THAT WE HOLD.
[CHEERS] THAT IS HOW CHANGE HAPPENS.
[CHEERS] LOOK, HILLARY'S GOT HER SHARE OF
CRITICS. SHE'S BEEN CARICATURED BY THE
RIGHT AND BY SOME FOLKS ON THE
LEFT; ACCUSED OF EVERYTHING YOU CAN IMAGINE AND SOME THINGS YOU
, CANNOT.
[LAUGHTER] BUT SHE KNOWS THAT'S WHAT
HAPPENS WHEN YOU'RE UNDER A
MICROSCOPE FOR 40 YEARS.
[CHEERS] SHE KNOWS THAT SOMETIMES AND
THOSE 40 YEARS SHE'S MADE
MISTAKES.
JUST LIKE I HAVE; JUST LIKE WE
ALL DO. THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE TRY.

[CHEERS] THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU'RE THE KIND OF CITIZEN TEDDY ROOSEVELT ONCE DESCRIBED NOT THE
, TIMID SOULS WHO CRITICIZE FROM THE SIDELINES, BUT SOMEONE "WHO IS ACTUALLY IN THE ARENAWHO STRIVES VALIANTLY; WHO ERRS[BUT] WHO AT THE BEST KNOWS IN THE END
THE TRIUMPH OF HIGH ACHIEVEMENT."
[CHEERS] HILLARY CLINTON IS THAT WOMAN IN
THE ARENA.
[CHEERS] SHE'S BEEN THERE FOR US  EVEN IF
WE HAVEN'T ALWAYS NOTICED. AND AND IF YOU'RE SERIOUS ABOUT OUR
DEMOCRACY, YOU CAN'T AFFORD TO
STAY HOME JUST BECAUSE SHE MIGHT
NOT ALIGN WITH YOU ON EVERY
ISSUE. YOU'VE GOT TO GET IN THE ARENA
WITH HER, BECAUSE DEMOCRACY
ISN'T A SPECTATOR SPORT. AMERICA
ISN'T ABOUT "YES HE WILL." IT'S
ABOUT "YES WE CAN." AND WE'RE

[CHEERS] AND WE'RE GOING TO CARRY HILLARY
TO VICTORY THIS FALL, BECAUSE
THAT'S WHAT THE MOMENT DEMANDS.
[CHEERS] YES WE CAN. YOU KNOW, THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF
TALK IN THIS CAMPAIGN ABOUT WHAT
AMERICA HAS LOST. PEOPLE WHO TELL US THAT OUR WAY OF LIFE IS BEING UNDERMINED BY PERNICIOUS CHANGES AND DARK FORCES BEYOND OUR CONTROL. THEY TELL VOTERS THERE'S A "REAL AMERICA" OUT THERE THAT MUST BE RESTORED. THIS ISN'T AN IDEA THAT STARTED WITH DONALD TRUMP.
IT'S BEEN PEDDLED BY POLITICIANS FOR A LONG TIME. PROBABLY FROM THE START OF OUR REPUBLIC. AND IT'S GOT ME THINKING ABOUT THE STORY I TOLD YOU TWELVE
YEARS AGO TONIGHT, ABOUT MY
KANSAS GRANDPARENTS AND THE
THINGS THEY TAUGHT ME WHEN I WAS
GROWING UP. THEY CAME FROM THE HEARTLAND;
THEIR ANCESTORS BEGAN SETTLING THERE ABOUT 200 YEARS AGO. THEY I DON'T KNOW IF THEY HAD THEIR
BIRTH CERTIFICATES.
[LAUGHTER] THEY WERE SCOTCH-IRISH MOSTLY,
FARMERS, TEACHERS, RANCH HANDS,
PHARMACISTS, OIL RIG WORKERS. HARDY, SMALL-TOWN FOLKS. SOME WERE DEMOCRATS, BUT A LOT OF THEM, MAYBE EVEN MOST OF THEM
WERE REPUBLICANS. MY GRANDPARENTS EXPLAINED THAT
FOLKS IN THESE PARTS DID NOT
LIKE SHOWOFFS. THEY DIDN'T ADMIRE BRAGGARTS OR BULLIES. THEY DIDN'T RESPECT MEAN-SPIRITEDNESS, OR FOLKS WHO
WERE ALWAYS LOOKING FOR SHORTCUTS IN LIFE. INSTEAD, WHAT THEY VALUE WERE TRAITS LIKE HONESTY AND HARD WORK. KINDNESS, COURTESY, HUMILITY, RESPONSIBILITY HELPING EACH
, OTHER OUT. THAT'S WHAT THEY BELIEVED IN. TRUE THINGS. THINGS THAT LAST. THE THINGS WE TRY TO TEACH OUR KIDS. AND WHAT MY GRANDPARENTS
UNDERSTOOD WAS THAT THESE VALUES
WERE LIMITED TO KANSAS. THEY WEREN'T LIMITED TO SMALL TOWNS. THESE VALUES COULD TRAVEL TO HAWAII; EVEN THE OTHER SIDE OF
THE WORLD, WHERE MY MOTHER WOULD
END UP WORKING TO HELP POOR
WOMEN GET A BETTER LIFE.
[CHEERS] MY GRANDPARENTS KNEW THESE
VALUES WEREN'T RESERVED FOR ONE
RACE; THEY COULD BE PASSED DOWN
TO A HALF-KENYAN GRANDSON, OR A
HALF-ASIAN GRANDDAUGHTER; IN
FACT, THEY WERE THE SAME VALUES
MICHELLE'S PARENTS, THE
DESCENDANTS OF SLAVES, TAUGHT
THEIR OWN KIDS LIVING IN A
BUNGALOW ON THE SOUTH SIDE OF
CHICAGO.
[CHEERS] THEY KNEW THESE VALUES WERE
EXACTLY WHAT DREW IMMIGRANTS HERE, AND THEY BELIEVED THAT THE CHILDREN OF THOSE IMMIGRANTS WERE JUST AS AMERICAN AS THEIR OWN, WHETHER THEY WORE A COWBOY
HAT OR A YARMULKE; A BASEBALL CAP OR A HIJAB.
[CHEERS] AMERICA HAS CHANGED OVER THE
YEARS. BUT THESE VALUES MY GRANDPARENTS TAUGHT ME, THEY HAVEN'T GONE
ANYWHERE. THEY'RE AS STRONG AS EVER; STILL CHERISHED BY PEOPLE OF EVERY PARTY, EVERY RACE, AND EVERY FAITH. THEY LIVE ON IN EACH OF US. WHAT MAKES US AMERICAN, WHAT MAKES US PATRIOTS, IS BUTTON HERE. THAT'S WHAT MATTERS.
[CHEERS] THAT'S WHY WE CAN TAKE THE FOOD
AND MUSIC AND HOLIDAYS AND
STYLES OF OTHER COUNTRIES, AND
BLEND IT INTO SOMETHING UNIQUELY
OUR OWN. THAT'S WHY WE CAN ATTRACT
STRIVERS AND ENTREPRENEURS FROM
AROUND THE GLOBE TO BUILD NEW
FACTORIES AND CREATE NEW
INDUSTRIES HERE. THAT'S WHY OUR MILITARY CAN LOOK
THE WAY IT DOES, EVERY SHADE OF
HUMANITY, FORGED INTO COMMON
SERVICE. THAT'S WHY ANYONE WHO THREATENS
OUR VALUES, WHETHER FASCISTS OR
COMMUNISTS OR JIHADISTS OR
HOMEGROWN DEMAGOGUES, WILL
ALWAYS FAIL IN THE END.
[CHEERS] THAT IS AMERICA.
[CHEERS] THAT IS AMERICA.
THOSE BONDS OF AFFECTION; THAT COMMON CREED. WE DON'T FEAR THE FUTURE; WE SHAPE IT, EMBRACE IT, AS ONE PEOPLE, STRONGER TOGETHER THAN WE ARE ON OUR OWN. THAT'S WHAT HILLARY CLINTON UNDERSTANDS THIS FIGHTER, THIS
, STATESWOMAN, THIS MOTHER AND
GRANDMOTHER, THIS PUBLIC SERVANT, AS PATRIOT, THAT'S THE
AMERICA SHE'S FIGHTING FOR.
[CHEERS] AND THAT'S WHY I HAVE
CONFIDENCE, AS I LEAVE THIS
STAGE TONIGHT, THAT THE
DEMOCRATIC PARTY IS IN GOOD
HANDS.
[CHEERS] MY TIME IN THIS OFFICE HASN'T
FIXED EVERYTHING; AS MUCH AS
WE'VE DONE, THERE'S STILL SO
MUCH I WANT TO DO. BUT FOR ALL THE TOUGH LESSONS
I'VE HAD TO LEARN; FOR ALL THE
PLACES I'VE FALLEN SHORT; I'VE
TOLD HILLARY, AND I'LL TELL YOU
WHAT'S PICKED ME BACK UP, EVERY
SINGLE TIME. IT'S BEEN YOU.
[CHEERS] THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.
[CHEERS] IT'S THE LETTER I KEEP ON MY WALL FROM A SURVIVOR IN OHIO WHO TWICE ALMOST LOST EVERYTHING TO CANCER, BUT URGED ME TO KEEP FIGHTING FOR HEALTH CARE REFORM, EVEN WHEN THE BATTLE SEEMED
LOST.
DO NOT QUIT. IT'S THE PAINTING I KEEP IN MY
PRIVATE OFFICE, A BIG-EYED,
GREENAWALT WITH BLUE WINGS MADE
BY A SEVEN YEAR-OLD GIRL WHO WAS
TAKEN FROM US IN NEWTOWN, GIVEN
TO ME BY HER PARENTS SO I WOULDN'T FORGET A REMINDER OF
, ALL THE PARENTS WHO HAVE
TURNED THEIR GRIEF INTO ACTION.
[CHEERS] IT'S THE SMALL BUSINESS OWNER IN
COLORADO WHO CUT MOST OF HIS OWN
SALARY SO HE WOULDN'T HAVE TO
LAY OFF ANY OF HIS WORKERS IN THE RECESSION BECAUSE HE SAID,
"THAT WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN IN THE
SPIRIT OF AMERICA."
[CHEERS] IT'S THE CONSERVATIVE IN TEXAS
WHO SAID HE DISAGREED WITH ME ON
EVERYTHING, BUT APPRECIATED
THAT, LIKE HIM, I TRY TO BE A
GOOD DAD.
[CHEERS] IT'S THE COURAGE OF THE YOUNG
SOLDIER FROM ARIZONA WHO NEARLY
DIED ON THE BATTLEFIELD IN
AFGHANISTAN, BUT WHO'S LEARNED
TO SPEAK AGAIN AND WALK AGAIN. AND EARLIER THIS YEAR, STEPPED
THROUGH THE DOOR OF THE OVAL
OFFICE ON HIS OWN POWER, TO
SALUTE AND SHAKE MY HAND.
[CHEERS] IT'S EVERY AMERICAN WHO BELIEVED WE COULD CHANGE THIS COUNTRY FOR
THE BETTER, SO MANY OF YOU WHO'D
NEVER BEEN INVOLVED IN POLITICS, WHO PICKED UP PHONES, AND HIT
THE STREETS, AND USED THE INTERNET IN AMAZING NEW WAYS TO
-- THAT I DID NOT UNDERSTAND,
THAT MADE CHANGE HAPPEN.
YOU ARE THE BEST ORGANIZERS ON
THE PLANET, AND I'M SO PROUD OF
ALL THE CHANGE YOU'VE MADE POSSIBLE.
[CHEERS] TIME AND AGAIN, YOU'VE PICKED ME
UP. I HOPE, SOMETIMES, I PICKED YOU UP, TOO.
[CHEERS] AND TONIGHT, I ASK YOU TO DO FOR HILLARY CLINTON WHAT YOU DID FOR ME. I ASK YOU TO CARRY HER THE SAME WAY YOU CARRY ME. BECAUSE YOU'RE WHO I WAS TALKING ABOUT TWELVE YEARS AGO, WHEN I
TALKED ABOUT HOPE. IT'S BEEN YOU WHO'VE FUELED MY DOGGED FAITH IN OUR FUTURE, EVEN
WHEN THE ODDS ARE GREAT; EVEN
WHEN THE ROAD IS LONG. HOPE IN
THE FACE OF DIFFICULTY; HOPE IN
THE FACE OF UNCERTAINTY; THE
AUDACITY OF HOPE.
[CHEERS] AMERICA, YOU HAVE VINDICATED
THAT HOPE THESE PAST EIGHT
YEARS.
[CHEERS] AND NOW I'M READY TO PASS THE
BATON AND DO MY PART AS A
PRIVATE CITIZEN. THIS YEAR, IN THIS ELECTION, I'M ASKING YOU TO JOIN ME TO REJECT
CYNICISM, REJECT FEAR, TO SUMMON
WHAT'S BEST IN US; TO ELECT
HILLARY CLINTON AS THE NEXT
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.
[CHEERS] AND SHOW THE WORLD WE STILL
BELIEVE IN THE PROMISE OF THIS
GREAT NATION.
[CHEERS] THANK YOU FOR THIS INCREDIBLE
JOURNEY.
[CHEERS] LET'S KEEP IT GOING. GOD BLESS YOU, GOD BLESS THE UNITED STATES
OF AMERICA.

<strong>Gabriel A. Salguero</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> LET US PRAY. ALMIGHTY GOD, WE COME TO YOU TONIGHT BECAUSE WE RECOGNIZE OUR
DESPERATE NEED OF YOU. EACH OF US, DEMOCRATS, REPUBLICANS, INDEPENDENTS,<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> WE

OUR BROTHERS AND KEEPERS SISTER.
