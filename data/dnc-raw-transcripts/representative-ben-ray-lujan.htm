<strong>Ben Lujan</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> REP. LUJAN: I COME FROM A FAMILY
OF PIONEERS. MY GRANDPARENTS TOOK ON THE
ELEMENTS, LIVED THROUGH THE
GREAT DEPRESSION, SURVIVED POVERTY AND FAMILY TRAGEDY,<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> AND
MADE A PLACE FOR THEMSELVES IN
NEW MEXICO BEFORE IT WAS A STATE.
TILLED THEIR LAND, RAISED THEIR
CROPS, PROTECTED WHAT THEY HAD
AND TRIED TO HELP OTHERS. I GREW UP ON THAT SMALL FARM.
I SPENT MY CHILDHOOD TURNING DIRT, STACKING WOOD, FEEDING ANIMALS.
WE DIDN'T HAVE MUCH BUT WE HAD
EACH OTHER. WE HAD FAMILIA. MY DAD WAS A UNION IRON WORKER, LOCAL 495.
MY MOM HAD A JOB WITH THE LOCAL
SCHOOL DISTRICT.
THEY WERE MARRIED FOR 53 YEARS
BEFORE DAD PASSED.
DAD'S PARENTS BEFORE HIM WERE
MARRIED EVEN LONGER, 74 YEARS.
GRANDPA, A SHEEP HERDER WHO
FIRST PUT DOWN ROOTS IN NEW
MEXICO, WAS BORN IN THE ERA OF
THE HORSE AND BUGGY BUT LIVED TO SEE THE SPACE SHUTTLE SOAR INTO THE HEAVENS. MY MOM'S DAD, GRANDPA LUIS, HE
WAS A UNION CARPENTER WHO WENT
OFF TO SERVE IN WORLD WAR II WHILE HIS WIFE RAISED THE FAMILY AND WAS EXPECTING THEIR SEVENTH
CHILD. HE EARNED A BRONZE STAR FOR HIS HEROISM. WHEN I WAS YOUNG, MY GRANDPA AND GRANDMA HELPED CARE FOR US.
WHEN I WAS OLDER, THEY WERE HURT IN A CAR CRASH SO WE HELPED CARE
FOR THEM BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT FAMILIES DO. THOSE ARE THE VALUES I LEARNED
GROWING UP.
THAT'S WHY I'M HERE TODAY. I KNOW I MIGHT NOT LOOK LIKE
YOUR TYPICAL MEMBER OF CONGRESS
AND IT'S TRUE, I HAVEN'T REALLY GOTTEN THE BOLO TIE LOOK TO CATCH ON. BUT THE STORY OF MY FAMILY IS
THE STORY OF MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF OTHER FAMILIES. IT'S THE STORY OF THE GREAT AMERICAN FAMILY -- CARPENTERS
AND IRON WORKERS, SHEEP HERDERS
AND SOLDIERS. GENERATIONS OF AMERICANS HAVE
WORKED HARD AND LOOKED OUT FOR
EACH OTHER, SERVING AND
SACRIFICING FOR THE NEXT GENERATION.
WE ALL GATHER TOGETHER TO
CELEBRATE THE GOOD TIMES.
WE ALL RALLY AROUND EACH OTHER
IN TIMES OF HARDSHIP AND TRAGEDY.
WE ALL TRY TO LEAVE THINGS A
LITTLE BETTER THAN WE FOUND THEM
AND THESE VALUES HOLD TRUE NO
MATTER WHO YOU ARE OR WHERE YOU
COME FROM.
AS DEMOCRATS, WE BELIEVE THAT
EVERYBODY IN AMERICA SHOULD HAVE THE SAME OPPORTUNITY MY GRANDPARENTS AND PARENTS HAD, TO HAVE A PLACE OF YOUR OWN, TO BUILD SOME REAL ECONOMIC SECURITY THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY WILL DISAPPEAR OVERNIGHT,
TO PASS SOMETHING ON TO YOUR
KIDS AND GRANDKIDS.
THOSE ARE THE VALUES THAT BUILT OUR PARTY AND FOR A CENTURY WE HAVE LED THE FIGHT FOR SOCIAL
SECURITY AND MEDICARE, FOR PEL
GRANTS AND THE G.I. BILL, FOR
UNIVERSAL HEALTHCARE, FOR
INCLUSION AND EQUALITY AND OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL. WE ARE PROUD OF OUR ACCOMPLISHMENTS BUT NOW IT'S OUR
TURN TO CONTINUE THAT TRADITION. WE, TOO, MUST LEAVE THINGS
BETTER THAN WE FOUND THEM AND
HILLARY CLINTON IS THE PRESIDENT
WHO WILL LEAD US!
[APPLAUSE] REP. LUJAN: BUT SHE NEEDS A
CONGRESS THAT WILL WORK WITH
HER.
FOR NEARLY SIX YEARS,
REPUBLICANS HAVE HELD THE
MAJORITY IN THE PEOPLE'S HOUSE
BUT CLINGING TO THAT MAJORITY IS
THE ONLY THING THEY'VE ACCOMPLISHED.
FOR NEARLY SIX YEARS, HOUSE
REPUBLICANS HAVE PUT PARTY OVER COUNTRY.
FOR NEARLY SIX YEARS, THEY'VE
BEEN AFRAID TO STAND UP TO THE THE BIGOTS AND CONSPIRACY THEORISTS LIKE THE ONE THEY JUST
NOMINATED FOR PRESIDENT. MILLIONS HAVE JOINED US FROM REJECTING DONALD TRUMP'S BULLYING, RACISM, AND HIS ATTEMPT TO DIVIDE OUR AMERICAN FAMILY.
GROWING UP, MY GRANDPARENTS
SHARED WITH ME THE AGE-OLD WISDOM -- TELL ME WHO YOU WALK
WITH AND I'LL TELL YOU WHO YOU
ARE. FOR ME, THE CHOICE IS EASY. I'M VERY REAL LEADERSHIP, SOMEONE WITH CHARACTER AND VALUES.
I'M PROUD TO WALK WITH HILLARY CLINTON BUT IF YOUR MEMBER OF CONGRESS IS SUPPORTING DONALD
TRUMP, INSTEAD ASK YOURSELF
THIS. OF WHAT DOES THAT SAY ABOUT THEIR LEADERSHIP, THEIR CHARACTER, THEIR VALUES, IF THEY WON'T EVEN STAND UP TO DONALD
TRUMP, WHAT MAKES YOU THINK THEY'LL STAND UP FOR YOU AND YOUR FAMILY?</span><span class='hidden-full-transcript-ellipses'>...</span></p><a href='#' class='hidden-full-transcript-link'><i class='icon-chevron-down'></i> <span class='link-show-full-text'>Show Full Text</span><i class='icon-chevron-up'></i> <span class='link-show-less-text'>Show Less Text</span></a>
