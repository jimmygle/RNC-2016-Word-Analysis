<strong>Sherman Jackson</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> AND THE NAME OF GOD, THE MOST GRACIOUS, WE ASK YOU TO LOOK UPON THIS DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL CONVENTION THROUGH THE EYE OF YOUR INTERNET MERCY. AS THE<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> EVENTS OF THE DAY
CHALLENGE US IN OUR ABILITY TO
HEAR EACH OTHER, TRUST EACH OTHER, AND ONE FOR EACH OTHER WHAT WE WANT FOR OURSELVES, WE
ASK YOU TO RESTORE OUR HEARTS TO THE CAPACITY OF HUMAN
CONNECTION, EMPATHY, AND LOVE. OUR TIME CALLS FOR THE VERY BEST
FROM OUR POLITICAL LEADERS. GUIDE TO THEM TO THEIR VERY HIGHEST SELVES. TEACH THEM THAT OF ALL THE
THINGS THAT NATIONS PRODUCE,
NONE IS MORE BELOVED TO YOU THAN JUSTICE TEMPERED WITH COMPASSION.
AS THE MUSLIM SAGE ONCE PUT IT,
GOD WILL A A JUST NATION EVEN IF
IT IS UNBELIEVING, AND GOD WILL NOT A AN UNJUST NATION EVEN IF
IT IS BELIEVING. MANY NATIONS, DUE TO ARROGANCE
OR BAD LEADERSHIP, HAVE BEEN
BLIND TO THIS TRUTH. PLEASE DO NOT PLACE OF AMONG SUCH NATIONS. WE ARE NOT A PERFECT COUNTRY, BUT WE ASK YOU TO ASPIRE US ALWAYS TO STRIVE TO BE A BETTER
COUNTRY. GRANT US THE COURAGE TO KNOWLEDGE AND MAKE AMENDS FOR OUR ERRORS, INCLUDING THE WAYS WE HAD DEVALUED, COMPROMISED,
AND STIGMATIZED ALL TOO MANY
AMERICAN LIVES, ESPECIALLY LIKE LIVES -- BLACK LIVES. LET NOT OF OUR GRIEVANCES, NO MATTER HOW LEGITIMATE, DESENSITIZE US TO THE SANCTITY
OF ALL INNOCENT HUMAN LIFE, INCLUDING THE LIVES OF LAW ENFORCEMENT, WHO BRAVELY SERVE
IN A DANGEROUS, YET ALL TOO
OFTEN THANKLESS, JOB. TODAY THE SCOURGE OF TERRORISM SCARES OUR PEOPLE AND THE ENTIRE
WORLD. PROTECT US FROM THIS EVIL MENACE, AND GUIDE US TO THE APPROPRIATE AND MOST EFFECTIVE RESPONSE. BUT RID US OF THAT HURTFUL HAVE
OF STEREOTYPING ENTIRE PEOPLES. WHETHER IT IS ANTI-SEMITISM OR
ISLAMOPHOBIA, LET THERE BE NO
PLACE FOR SUCH BIGOTRY IN OUR COUNTRY. OH, GOD, YOU ARE THE LIGHT OF THE HEAVENS AND THE EARTH. NEITHER EASTERN NOR WESTERN,
SHINE YOUR GUIDING LIGHT ON THIS
DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL CONVENTION. SHINE YOUR GUIDING LIGHT INTO THE HEARTS OF OUR POLITICAL LEADERS, AND SHINE YOUR GUIDING LIGHT UPON THE PEOPLE OF THE
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.
