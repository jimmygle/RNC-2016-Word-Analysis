<strong>Jimmy Carter</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> GOOD EVENING, DEMOCRATS. 46 YEARS AGO, I STOOD BEFORE YOU TO ACCEPT YOUR NOMINATION AS
PRESIDENT. WE WISH WE COULD BE THERE
TONIGHT TO HELP PREPARE<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> FOR WHAT WILL BE AN EXTREMELY IMPORTANT ELECTION, ONE THAT WILL DEFINE FOR A GENERATION WHO WE ARE AS A
NATION AND A PEOPLE.
I FEEL PROUD THAT OUR TWO DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES, WHO
COMPETED THROUGHOUT A LONG PRIMARY SEASON, COMPORTED THEMSELVES WITH MIDI, TALKED ABOUT ISSUES THAT MATTER, AND
PRESENTED A VISION -- WITH DIGNITY, TALKED ABOUT ISSUES
THAT MATTER, AND PRESENTED A
VISION FOR OUR NATION.
YOUNG AMERICANS, STAY ENGAGED, THEY INVOLVED, AND BE SURE TO
VOTE THIS NOVEMBER. IT HAS BECOME MORE IMPORTANT
THAN EVER TO LIFT PEOPLE UP TO A BRIGHTER FUTURE. INSTEAD, WE SEE A REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE WHO SEEMS TO REJECT THE MORAL AND ETHICAL
PRINCIPLES ON WHICH OUR NATION
WAS FOUNDED.
WE CAN AND MUST DO BETTER. WE WILL SOON BE CHOOSING
BETWEEN STARK CONTRASTS IN STYLE
AND EXPERIENCE.
I HAVE KNOWN HILLARY CLINTON FOR DECADES. WHEN SHE WAS A YOUNG ATTORNEY, I
APPOINTED HER TO THE LEGAL
SERVICES CORPORATION, WHERE SHE
BECAME THE FIRST WOMAN CHAIR. THERE, HILLARY FOUGHT TO MAKE
SURE THAT IN OUR COURTS, THOSE
WITH THE LEAST WERE TREATED THE
SAME AS THOSE WITH THE MOST. SINCE THEN, HILLARY HAS ALWAYS DEMONSTRATED A WILLINGNESS TO TAKE ON DIFFICULT CHALLENGES AND TO GET THINGS DONE.
HER LIFE HAS BEEN DEDICATED TO
ADVANCING HUMAN RIGHTS ACROSS THE GLOBE, ESPECIALLY FOR WOMEN
AND CHILDREN. THESE ARE PERILOUS TIMES, THAT NEED SOMEONE WITH A STRONG
HEART, A DEEP UNDERSTANDING OF ISSUES, AND A STRONG HAND.
-- AND A STEADY HAND. HILLARY CLINTON HAS MY SUPPORT,
AND I KNOW SHE HAS YOURS. THANK YOU ALL, AND GOD BLESS THE
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.
>> PLEASE WELCOME SENATOR CHUCK SCHUMER FROM NEW YORK.
