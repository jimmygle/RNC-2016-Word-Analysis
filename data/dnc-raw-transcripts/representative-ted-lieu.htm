<p class='short_transcript'> >> GOOD EVENING.
[CHEERS] I WAS NOT BORN IN AMERICA, BUT I SERVED THIS GREAT COUNTRY EVERY
DAY.
AS A CURRENT MEMBER OF THE UNITED STATES AIR FORCE RESERVE,<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> AND MEMBER OF CONGRESS AND AN
IMMIGRANT WHOSE PARENTS CHOSE
THIS GREAT NATION, I CARE DEEPLY ABOUT WHO SERVES AS OUR
COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF. I CAN'T WAIT UNTIL HER 20TH WHEN
THAT PERSON IS -- JANUARY 20
WHEN THAT PERSON IS HILLARY
CLINTON.
[CHEERS] YOU DON'T HAVE TO SERVE IN
CONGRESS OR SERVE IN THE MILITARY TO BE -- DEMAND THAT
THE PERSON WE ENTRUST WITH THE
SAFETY OF OUR COUNTRY, THE LIVES
OF OUR TROOPS AND THE LAUNCH
CODES FOR NUCLEAR WEAPONS HAS A
STEADY HAND.
ALL YOU HAVE TO BE IS A VOTER. THE SERIES PART OF DONALD TRUMP'S SPEECH, THE APOCALYPTIC
VISION OF AMERICA, IT IS THAT HE
SAID, I ALONE CAN FIX THIS. EVERY MILITARY COMMANDER I'VE EVER MET NOTE THAT YOU CAN'T DO
IT ALONE. YOU CAN'T BE BRASH AND YOU OF
LOVE.
-- CAN'T MAKE STUFF UP. WHEN YOU IGNORE THE FACT, PEOPLE
WILL DIE. HILLARY CLINTON THOSE THAT EACH OF US MAKE A STRONGER. SMART DIPLOMACY, A POWERFUL
ECONOMY COME EDUCATION CHILDREN
-- EDUCATED CHILDREN, WE ARE
STRONGER TOGETHER. DONALD TRUMP SAID, AND I'M NOT
MAKING THIS UP, I KNOW MORE ABOUT ISIS THEN THE GENERALS DO. PLEASE WELCOME TO THE STAGE THE FOUR-STAR GENERAL WHO KNOWS MORE ABOUT ISIS THAN ANYONE. THE PRESIDENT SPECIAL ENVOY AND COMMANDER OF INTERNATIONAL SECURITY ASSISTANCE FORCE IS, RETIRED GENERAL JOHN ALLEN.
