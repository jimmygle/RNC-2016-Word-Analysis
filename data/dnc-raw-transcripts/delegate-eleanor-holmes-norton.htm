<strong>Eleanor Holmes Norton</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> REP. NORTON: THANK YOU. THANK YOU.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THANK YOU FELLOW AMERICANS, FELLOW DELEGATES. I AM PRIVILEGED TO REPRESENT THE
700,000 AMERICAN<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> CITIZENS
GROWING BY 1000 EVERY MONTH IN
YOUR NATION'S CAPITAL. WE ARE SO PROUD OF OUR CITY,
WITH A BUDGET LARGER THAN THAT OF 13 STATES, THAT WE WANT TO BECOME THE 51ST STATE OF THE UNITED STATES.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WE ARE HOME TO OUR MOST POWERFUL INSTITUTIONS, YET WE HAVE BEEN
DENIED OUR POWER AS AMERICAN CITIZENS. THE POWER WE SEEK IS ORDINARY, NOT LOFTY. IT IS THE DEMOCRATIC POWER OF EQUAL CITIZENSHIP.
[APPLAUSE] IT IS THE POWER OF LAWFUL
CONTROL OVER $4 BILLION IN
LOCALLY RAISED FUNDS. 30 STATES RELY MORE ON FEDERAL FUNDS TO REPLACE THEIR ANNUAL
BUDGET THAN D.C. DOES. IT IS THE POWER OF LOCAL CONTROL OVER PURELY LOCAL LAWS, LIKE OUR
GUN SAFETY LAWS.
[APPLAUSE] THAT REPUBLICANS TRY TO
ELIMINATE EVERY SINGLE YEAR. AND YES, IT IS ALSO THE DEMOCRATIC POWER THAT GAVE BIRTH
TO THE NATION ITSELF, THE QUID
PRO QUO POWER OF THE VOTE IN THE
HOUSE AND SENATE IN RETURN FOR
THE TAXES WE PAY TO SUPPORT THE
UNITED STATES. FOR D.C. RESIDENCE NOT ONLY PAY TAXES FOR OUR REPRESENTATION, WE PAY THE HIGHEST FEDERAL TAXES PER CAPITA IN THE UNITED STATES,
WITH NO VOTE IN THE HOUSE AND S ENATE TO SHOW FOR THOSE TAXES. THE LACK OF VOTING RIGHTS, THE
NATION'S FOUNDERS DECLARED THEIR INDEPENDENCE AND DARED THEIR
OPPONENTS TO STOP THEM. D.C. RESIDENTS ARE NOT DECLARING
INDEPENDENCE FROM OUR COUNTRY, WE ARE DECLARING OUR INTENTION TO JOIN OUR COUNTRY AS THE 51ST STATE.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] REPUBLICANS SAY WE WANT TOO
MUCH, THAT OUR TAXPAYING CITIZENS ARE A SPECIAL RESPONSIBILITY OF THE
GOVERNMENT, AND UNDERMINING THIS LOCAL 73.
-- LOCAL SOVEREIGNTY. OUR DEMOCRATIC PLATFORMS IS
RESTORING DEMOCRACY MEANS
REPRESENTATION FOR THE DISTRICT
OF COLUMBIA. OUR NOMINEE HILLARY CLINTON SAYS AS PRESIDENT, I WILL BE A VOCAL CHAMPION FOR D.C. STATEHOOD. NEVER BEFORE HAS A PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEE TAKEN OFFICE WITH SO SOLID A PROMISE FOR FULL AND
EQUAL CITIZENSHIP FOR D.C. RESIDENCE. AND LISTEN UP, AMERICA. A NOMINEE WHO WILL STAND UP FOR D.C. WILL STAND UP FOR YOU, TOO. HILLARY FOR PRESIDENT, STATEHOOD FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA.
