<strong>Unidentified Speaker</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> I LOVE YOU, TOO, SOUTH CAROLINA. TONIGHT, I JOIN YOU, I CAME FROM DENMARK, SOUTH CAROLINA, WHERE
WE HAVE THREE STOPLIGHTS AND A BLINKING LIGHT. TO<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> STAND HERE AT THIS CROSSROADS
IN OUR NATIONS HISTORY IS PROOF
THAT ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE. TO JOIN YOU TONIGHT, BORN OUT OF STRUGGLE, A PRODUCT OF THE CIVIL
RIGHTS MOVEMENT, THE SON OF THOSE WHO MISSED THE BIRTH OF
HIS OLDEST CHILD BECAUSE HE WAS IN PRISON, FIGHTING FOR WHAT HE
BELIEVED IN. THEY TAUGHT ME NOT ONLY THE
WORDS OF FREDERICK DOUGLASS,
"WITHOUT STRUGGLE THERE IS NO PROGRESS," BUT ALSO THE WORDS OF
OUR STATE MOTTO, "DON SPIRO,
SPIRO."
"WHILE I BREATHE, I HOPE.
" I AM A PRODUCT OF THEIR STRUGGLE.
I AM A PRODUCT OF THAT HOPE. AND I AM NOT THE ONLY ONE. THE TRUTH IS, EVERY SINGLE ONE OF US IS A PRODUCT OF STRUGGLE.
OUR LIVES WERE MADE POSSIBLE
THROUGH STRUGGLE AND HOPE.
AND NOW, DEMOCRATS MORE THAN EVER, WE MUST CONTINUE TO
EMBRACE OUR HISTORY. RECOGNIZING THAT THE PARTY OF
BARACK OBAMA WAS FIRST THE PARTY
OF FANNIE LOU HAMER AND THE MISSISSIPPI FREEDOM DEMOCRATIC PARTY. THAT BEFORE THERE WAS A HILLARY CLINTON, THERE WAS A SHIRLEY
CHISHOLM.</span><span class='hidden-full-transcript-ellipses'>...</span></p><a href='#' class='hidden-full-transcript-link'><i class='icon-chevron-down'></i> <span class='link-show-full-text'>Show Full Text</span><i class='icon-chevron-up'></i> <span class='link-show-less-text'>Show Less Text</span></a>

IT'S<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> AN UNLIKELY STORY OF STRUGGLE AND HOPE THAT JOINS US TOGETHER AS WE DARE TO MARCH FORWARD. AND I'M HERE TO TELL YOU THAT
HILLARY CLINTON KNOWS THAT,
