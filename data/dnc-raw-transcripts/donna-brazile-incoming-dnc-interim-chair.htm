<strong>Donna Brazile</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> GROWING UP, I WAS ALWAYS TOLD
THAT A LADY SHOULD NEVER REVEAL
HER AGE. SO I WILL SIMPLY SAY THIS -- I'M
NO SPRING CHICKEN.
I'VE SEEN SOME THINGS IN<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> MY
TIME. AND AS A CHILD, I LIVED THROUGH AND SURVIVED THE SEGREGATED SOUTH. I SAT AT THE BACK OF THE BUS AT
A TIME WHEN AMERICA WASN'T AS
GREAT AS IT COULD BE, AS A GROWN WOMAN, I SAW THE FIRST BLACK PRESIDENT, REACH OUT A HAND, AND TOUCH THE FACE OF A CHILD LIKE I WAS, LOOK IN HIS EYES TOWARD A
BETTER FUTURE.
I HAVE NEVER, EVER IN ALL MY YEARS SEEN A LEADER SO COMMITTED TO DELIVERING THAT BETTER FUTURE
TO AMERICA'S CHILDREN AS HILLARY
CLINTON.
[APPLAUSE] LET ME TELL YOU WHEN I FIRST MET HILLARY CLINTON, WHEN HILLARY GRADUATED FROM LAW SCHOOL, SHE
COULD HAVE GONE TO WORK FOR A CORPORATION OR BIG LAW FIRM. INSTEAD, SHE WENT TO WORK FOR
THE CHILDREN DEFENSE FUND. SHE DIDN'T SIT IN THE OFFICE, SHE WENT UNDERCOVER GOING DOOR TO DOOR, INVESTIGATING DISCRIMINATION. DURING THAT SAME TIME, DONALD TRUMP WAS FACING A FEDERAL DISCRIMINATION LAWSUIT FOR
REFUSING TO RENT TO MINORITY
FAMILIES. HILLARY CLINTON RAISED HER OWN SAFETY TO SEEK OUT THE TRUTH AND
COMFORT THE AFFLICTED AND TO MAKE JUSTICE WEATHER WAS NONE. IT WAS AT THE CHILDREN'S DEFENSE
FUND THAT I MET HILLARY CLINTON. I WAS 22, FEISTY, AND READY TO
FIGHT.
I REMEMBER THINKING HERE IS A
WOMAN WHO DOESN'T MESS AROUND. AS A SOUTHERN GIRLS DON'T MESS
AROUND. HILLARY DIDN'T WANT TO TALK
ABOUT ANYTHING OTHER THAN HOW TO
MAKE CHILDREN'S LIVES BETTER. THAT IS THE HILLARY I KNOW, THAT
IS WHO SHE IS. SHE QUIETLY FOUGHT AND FOUGHT HARD. THAT HAS NEVER CHANGED. FOR STANDING UP FOR WOMEN HERE
AT HOME AND GIRLS AROUND THE WORLD AS SECRETARY OF STATE. HILLARY HAS NEVER FORGOTTEN WHAT
SHE LEARNED IN THAT VERY FIRST
JOB. THE BELIEVE THAT EVERY CHILD,
BLACK OR WHITE, NATIVEBORN,
IMMIGRANT, OR UNDOCUMENTED, THEY
DESERVE TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO LIVE UP TO THEIR GOD-GIVEN
POTENTIAL. AS A CHILD WHEN I SAT IN THE
BACK OF THE BUS, I WAS TOLD TIME
AND TIME AGAIN THAT GOD'S
POTENTIAL DOES NOT EXIST AND PEOPLE LIKE ME.
I SPEND MY LIFE FIGHTING TO CHANGE THAT AND FROM THE FIRST DAY I MET HILLARY CLINTON, I HAVE KNOWN SHE IS SOMEONE WHO CARES JUST AS MUCH AND WILL FIGHT JUST AS HARD FOR CHILDREN EVERYWHERE. YOU HAVE GOT A CHAMPION. KIDS WHO NEED HOPE, YOU'VE GOT A CHAMPION. AS LONG AS SHE'S IN CHARGE, WE
ARE NEVER GOING BACK AND THAT IS
WHY I'M WITH HER.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND LET ME SAY THIS, AS VICE
CHAIR OF THE DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL COMMITTEE, I PROMISE YOU MY FRIENDS, I COMMIT TO ALL AMERICANS THAT WE WILL HAVE A
PARTY THAT YOU CAN BE PROUD OF. WE WILL CELEBRATE TOGETHER THE INAUGURATION OF PRESIDENT HILLARY CLINTON IN JANUARY 2017. GOD BLESS YOU AND GOD BLESS
AMERICA.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
>> 75% OF THE STATE PRISON POPULATION CAME FROM SEVEN
NEIGHBORHOODS IN NEW YORK CITY. WE SAW THIS AS A CRISIS SO WE
CREATED A SCHOOL JUST FOR YOUNG
MEN OF COLOR SO WE COULD BRING A
LEVEL OF HOPE BACK INTO THOSE COMMUNITIES.
IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE THIS WAY. IF A YOUNG AND MY BELIEVE HE MAY
BE A SENATOR OR PRESIDENT, YOU
DON'T HAVE TO TELL HIM NOT TO DO IT.</span><span class='hidden-full-transcript-ellipses'>...</span></p><a href='#' class='hidden-full-transcript-link'><i class='icon-chevron-down'></i> <span class='link-show-full-text'>Show Full Text</span><i class='icon-chevron-up'></i> <span class='link-show-less-text'>Show Less Text</span></a>
