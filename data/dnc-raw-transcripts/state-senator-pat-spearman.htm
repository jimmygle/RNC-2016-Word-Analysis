<p class='short_transcript'> >> LGBT AMERICANS ARE OUR
COLLEAGUES, TEACHERS, SOLDIERS,
FRIENDS, OUR LOVED ONES. THEY ARE FULL AND EQUAL CITIZENS AND DESERVE THE RIGHTS OF
CITIZENSHIP.<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> TO DENY OPPORTUNITY TO ANY OF
OUR DAUGHTERS AND SONS, SOLELY
ON THE BASIS OF WHO THEY ARE AND
WHO THEY LOVE IS TO DENY THEM THE CHANCE TO LIVE UP TO THEIR
OWN GOD-GIVEN POTENTIAL. FROM STONEWALL TO LARAMIE AND NOW ORLANDO, WE HAVE SEEN TOO MANY EXAMPLES OF HOW THE
STRUGGLE TO LIVE FREELY, OPENLY
AND WITHOUT FEAR HAS BEEN MET BY VIOLENCE. WE HAVE TO STAND TOGETHER, BE PROUD TOGETHER, THERE IS NO BETTER REBUKE TO THE TERRORISTS
AND ALL THOSE WHO HATE. THE STAKES IN THIS ELECTION ARE
HIGH. I THINK ABOUT ALL THOSE MILLIONS OF WORRIES LARGE AND SMALL THAT SAME-SEX PARENTS AND LGBT
AMERICANS THINK ABOUT EVERY DAY. I'M GOING TO KEEP AS I HAVE
THROUGHOUT MY LIFE FIGHTING FOR
YOU, HE WRITES, YOUR CHILDREN AND YOUR FUTURES. I AM PROUD TO BE FIGHTING RIGHT
ALONGSIDE YOU.
[CHEERING] LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, PLEASE
WELCOME STATE SENATOR PAT

<p class='short_transcript'> >> GOOD EVENING, DEMOCRATS.
[CHEERING] I'M A VETERAN, A MINISTER, AN AFRICAN-AMERICAN AND I'M A PROUD MEMBER OF THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY. WHEN I JOINED OUR<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> MILITARY IN 1977, I LIVED IN FEAR OF BEING DISCHARGED. BUT TODAY, LGBTQ MEMBERS OF THE
MILITARY CONCERT OPENLY AND
PROUDLY.
-- CAN SERVE OPENLY AND PROUDLY.
[CHEERING] WHEN I WAS ELECTED TO THE STATE
LEGISLATURE IN 2012, I WAS ONE
OF ONLY TWO WHO WERE OPENLY GAY
AND TODAY I AM ONE OF FIVE.
[CHEERING] WHEN NEVADA STARTED RECOGNIZING SAME-SEX MARRIAGE IN 2014, WE
WERE ONE OF 26 STATES. AND TODAY, MARY G -- MARRIAGE
EQUALITY IS NATIONWIDE.
THAT IS PROGRESS.
[CHEERING] WE CAN'T STOP NOW. WE HAVE HEARD DONALD TRUMP SAY THAT HE WOULD PROTECT THE LGBTQ
COMMUNITY. BUT HE IS AGAINST MARRIAGE EQUALITY AND HAS SAID HE IS ALL
FOR OVERTURNING IT.
>> BOO!
>> DONALD TRUMP SAYS THAT ANYONE CAN USE ANY BATHROOM AND TRUMP TOWER BUT HE STILL SUPPORTS
HEINOUS, BATHROOM BILLS AND HE
WOULD STRIP AWAY THE RIGHTS OF
TRANSGENDER AMERICANS.
>> BOO!
>> BUT HIS WORST ATTACK ON US
WAS HIS VICE PRESIDENTIAL PICK. INDIANA GOVERNOR MIKE PENCE.
>> BOO!
>> GOVERNOR PENCE SON-IN-LAW
THAT LET INDIVIDUALS AND BUSINESSES AND I SERVICES TO
LGBTQ AMERICANS AND HE USED RELIGION AS A WEAPON TO
DISCRIMINATE. AND THE STATE LOST MILLIONS OF
DOLLARS AS A RESULT. AS A LESBIAN, THAT HURTS ME. AS A PERSON OF FAITH, THAT
OFFENDS ME. AS A LEGISLATOR WORKING HARD TO CREATE JOBS, THAT BAFFLES ME.
[CHEERING] NO BATTER THE -- THE MATTER THE COST OF THE COUNTRY, DONALD
TRUMP AND MIKE PENCE WILL STRIP
AWAY THE PROGRESS WE HAVE BOUGHT
SO HARD TO WIN.
WHY? BECAUSE THEY FEAR DIVERSITY. WE CELEBRATED. THEY FEAR PROGRESS, WE BUILD ON IT. THEY FEAR IN QUALITY, WE WILL
KEEP FIGHTING FOR IT.
-- EQUALITY, WE WILL KEEP
FIGHTING FOR IT. DEMOCRATS, ARE WE GOING TO
RETREAT?
>> NO!
>> WILL WE KEEP WALKING FORWARD?
>> YES!
>> HILLARY CLINTON'S BATTLE
TESTED AND SHE WILL FIGHT ALONGSIDE US FOR INEQUALITY IN OUR SCHOOLS, COMMUNICATE,
WORKPLACES AND OUR NATION. SHE WILL MAKE THE EQUALITY ACT LEGALLY AND MAKE IT ILLEGAL TO DISCRIMINATE ON THE BASIS OF WHO YOU LOVE, WHO YOU ARE, WHEREVER YOU ARE OR WHERE EVER YOU WORK ONCE AND FOR ALL.
[CHEERING] THIS ELECTION, THIS ELECTION,
MAKE NO MISTAKE ABOUT IT WILL
NOT BE EASY. I KNOW THAT WE ARE READY. IN THE WORDS OF THE OLD NEGRO SPIRITUAL, LET'S WALK TOGETHER DEMOCRATS, DON'T GET WEARY,
LET'S WORK TOGETHER DEMOCRATS,
DON'T GET WEARY, LET'S TALK TOGETHER DEMOCRATS, DON'T GET WEARY. THERE IS A GREAT MEETING IN THE
PROMISED LAND OF EQUALITY. THANK YOU AND GOD BLESS YOU ALL.
