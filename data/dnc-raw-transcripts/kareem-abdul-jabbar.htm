<p class='short_transcript'> >> HELLO, EVERYONE.
[CHEERS] MICHAEL JORDAN AND I'M HERE WITH
HILLARY.
[LAUGHTER] I SAID THAT BECAUSE I KNOW THAT
DONALD TRUMP COULD NOT TELL THE
DIFFERENCE.
[LAUGHTER]<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> GOOD EVENING, EVERYONE. I'M KAREEM ABDUL-JABBAR.
[CHEERS] AND I'M HERE TO TELL YOU ABOUT THE CAPTAIN OF MANKIND, ONE OF
14 AMERICAN MUSLIM SOLDIERS WHO
HAVE DIED IN COMBAT SERVING THE
UNITED STATES SINCE 9/11. HIS FAMILY IMMIGRATED TO THE UNITED STATES FROM THE UNITED
ARAB AND A RITZ -- ARAB
EMIRATES.
THE FIRST IS THEY VISITED WAS
THE JEFFERSON MEMORIAL. THE WORDS AND GREAT THERE READ I HAVE SWORN UPON GOD ETERNAL,
HOSTILITY AGAINST EVERY FORM OF TYRANNY OVER THE MIND OF MAN. DONALD TRUMP'S IDEA TO REGISTER
MUSLIMS AND PREVENT THEM FROM
ENTERING OUR COUNTRY IS THE VERY TYRANNY JEFFERSON ABOARD -- A BHORRED.
[CHEERS] IN 1777, JEFFERSON DRAFTED THE VIRGINIA STATUTE FOR A LEGIT FREEDOM WHICH LATER BECAME A MODEL FOR THE FIRST AMENDMENT.
[CHEERS] TODAY, SO-CALLED RELIGIOUS FREEDOM ACT, LIKE THE ONE SIGNED BY GOVERNOR MIKE PENCE OF
INDIANA --</span><span class='hidden-full-transcript-ellipses'>...</span></p><a href='#' class='hidden-full-transcript-link'><i class='icon-chevron-down'></i> <span class='link-show-full-text'>Show Full Text</span><i class='icon-chevron-up'></i> <span class='link-show-less-text'>Show Less Text</span></a>

JEFFERSON WANTED BECAUSE THEY
ALLOW DISCRIMINATION.
[CHEERS] AT ITS CORE, DISCRIMINATION IS
THE RESULT OF FEAR. THOSE<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> WHO THINK AMERICAN SCARE
EASILY, ENOUGH TO ABANDON OUR
COUNTRY'S IDEALS IN EXCHANGE FOR
A FALSE SENSE OF SECURITY, UNDERESTIMATE OUR RESOLVE.
[CHEERS] TO THEM, WE SAY, ONLY DOES. NOT HERE, NOT EVER.

<p class='short_transcript'> >> YOU WANT TO SEE THE BEST OF AMERICA, YOU NEED LOOK NO FURTHER THAN ARMY CAPTAIN KHIZR KHAN. HE MOVED TO MARYLAND AS A SMALL
CHILD.
HE GRADUATED FROM<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> THE UNIVERSITY
OF VIRGINIA. BEFORE ENLISTING IN THE UNITED
STATES ARMY. IN JUNE 2004, HE WAS SERVING IN
IRAQ. ONE DAY WHILE HIS INFANTRY UNIT
WAS GUARDING THE GATES OF THE BASE, A SUSPICIOUS BIG OLD
APPEARED. CAPTAIN KHAN TOLD HIS TRIP TO
GET BACK. BUT HE WENT FORWARD. HE TOOK 10 STEPS TOWARD THE CAR
BEFORE IT EXPLODED. CAPTAIN KHAN WAS KILLED BUT HIS
UNIT WAS SAVED BY HIS COURAGEOUS
ACT. CAPTAIN KHAN WAS POSTHUMOUSLY
AWARDED THE BRONZE STAR AND
PURPLE HEART. HE WAS JUST 27 YEARS OLD. WE STILL WONDER WHAT MADE HIM
TAKE THOSE 10 STEPS. KHAN'S FATHER SAID IN A RECENT
INTERVIEW. MAYBE THAT IS THE POINT. ALL THE VALUES, ALTHOUGH SERVICE TO COUNTRY, ALL THE THINGS HE
LEARNED IN THIS COUNTRY KICKED
IN. IT WAS THOSE VALUES THAT MADE HIM TAKE THOSE 10 STEPS. THOSE 10 STEPS TOLD US WE DID
NOT MAKE A MISTAKE IN MOVING TO THIS COUNTRY, HIS FATHER FINISHED. HE STOOD UP AND SAID WE ARE
AMERICANS, WE WILL NOT TURN ON
EACH OTHER AND TURN ON
PRINCIPLES.
THAT IS WHAT WE DO HERE.
THAT IS WHO WE ARE.
THAT IS HOW WE WILL WIN.
THAT IS THE AMERICA THAT I KNOW ACCESS ALL SO PROUD TO BE A PART
OF IT. THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH.
