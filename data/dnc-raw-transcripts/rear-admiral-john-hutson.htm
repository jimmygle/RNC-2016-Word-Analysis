<strong>John D. Hutson</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> THANK YOU. GOOD EVENING. MY NAME IS JOHN HUDSON. UNLIKE DONALD TRUMP, THERE ARE TWO THINGS THAT I KNOW AN AWFUL
LOT ABOUT. LAW AND ORDER.
[CHEERS]<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> FOR 11 YEARS, I WAS A LAW SCHOOL DEAN.
FOR 30 YEARS I SERVED PROUDLY IN THE UNITED STATES NAVY INCLUDING AS THE JUDGE ADVOCATE GENERAL.
[CHEERS] GO NAVY.
[CHEERS] DONALD TRUMP CALLS HIMSELF THE
LAW AND ORDER CANDIDATE. BUT HE WILL HIGHLIGHT INTERNATIONAL LAW.
IN HIS WORD, HE ENDORSES TORTURE
AT A MINIMUM. HE WILL ORDER OUR TROOPS TO
COMMIT WAR CRIMES LIKE KILLING
CIVILIANS AND ASK THEY SAID YOU
HAVE TO TAKE OUT THEIR FAMILIES. WHAT DID HE SAY WHEN HE WAS TOLD
THAT WAS ILLEGAL? HE SAID, OUR TROOPS WILL NOT
REFUSE. BELIEVE ME. THIS MORNING, THIS VERY MORNING, HE PERSONALLY INVITED RUSSIA TO
HACK US.
>> BOO! THAT IS NOT LAW AND ORDER. THAT IS CRIMINAL INTENT.
[CHEERS] DONALD TRUMP WOULD ABANDON OUR ALLIES AND LET MORE COUNTRIES
GET NUCLEAR WEAPONS. HE LIED ABOUT DONATING TO
VETERANS. AND HE CALLED THE MILITARY THAT
I SERVED IN A DISASTER. IT IS EMBARRASSING ENOUGH THAT
HE IS THE FACE OF ONE OF OUR
POLITICAL PARTIES. THE REAL DISASTER WOULD BE IF WE
LET DONALD TRUMP BECOME THE FACE OF THE COUNTRY THAT WE LOVE.
[CHEERS] MORE THAN 120 REPUBLICANS,
NATIONAL SECURITY LEADERS,
REPUBLICAN NATIONAL SECURITY LEADERS RECENTLY WARNED THAT
DONALD TRUMP WOULD, IN THEIR WORDS, MAKE AMERICA LESS SAFE. HE EVEN MOCKED POWS LIKE JOHN MCCAIN. I SERVED IN THE SAME NAVY AS
JOHN MCCAIN. I USED TO VOTE IN THE SAME PARTY
AS JOHN MCCAIN. DONALD, YOU ARE NOT FIT TO POLISH JOHN MCCAIN'S BOOTS.
[CHEERS] BUT, AMERICA, WE HAVE A BETTER
CHOICE. HILLARY CLINTON IS THE ONLY
CANDIDATE WHO KNOWS HOW TO WORK
WITH OUR ALLIES, WHO HAS A SPECIFIC PLAN TO DEFEAT ISIS,
SHE IS SMART AND A STEADY.
SHE HAS THE EXPERIENCE, THE TEMPERAMENT AND THE SPINE TO BE
A SUPERB COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF.
[CHEERS] SHE KNOWS WHAT MAKES US BE ENVY
OF THE WORLD.
NOT OUR ABUNDANT NATURAL
RESOURCES OR OUR RESILIENT ECONOMY, OR EVEN THAT WE HAVE THE STRONGEST MILITARY HONORS, OUR STRENGTH COMES FROM WHO WE ARE AND WHO WE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN. OUR COMMUNITY.
-- HUMANITY.
[CHEERS] IF WE LOSE OUR HUMANITY, WE LOSE THE BATTLE AND THE WAR. ISIS AND OTHER RADICAL GROUPS
HAVE NO HUMANITY. THAT IS THEIR WEAKEST -- WEAKNESS. OUR ENEMY CANNOT DEFEAT US
MILITARILY. VICTORY FOR THEM WILL NOT BE FOUND ON THE BATTLEFIELD. FOR THEM, VICTOR IS TO MAKE US
-- VICTORY IS TO MAKE US MORE
LIKE THEM. PEOPLE WHO TORTURE. PEOPLE WHO DO STABILIZE THE
INTERNATIONAL ORDER.
WHO TARGET INNOCENTS BECAUSE THEY DO NOT LOOK OR PRAY LIKE THEM. DONALD TRUMP IS A WALKING, TALKING, RECRUITING POSTER FOR
TERRORISTS.
[CHEERS] THAT IS NOT HYPERBOLE. ISIS LITERALLY USED TRUMP IN A
COMMERCIAL. YOU CAN TELL A LOT A PERSON -- ABOUT A PERSON BY WHO THEY ADMIRE.
ELEANOR ROOSEVELT.
NELSON MANDELA. DOROTHY RODHAM. THESE ARE HILLARY CLINTON'S
HEROES. DONALD TRUMP: DONALD TRUMP
ADMIRES DONALD TRUMP. AND SADDAM HUSSEIN AND KIM JONG-IL AND AND -- VLADIMIR PUTIN, HE SAYS IN TERMS OF LEADERSHIP, HE IS GETTING AN A.
>> BOO.
>> I TAUGHT NATIONAL SECURITY LAW. PRAISING DICTATORS WAS AN AUTOMATIC PATH -- F IN MY CLASS.
[CHEERS] LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING, IN 2008, AT THE DEAN OF THE
UNIVERSITY OF NEW HAMPSHIRE
SCHOOL OF LAW, I INVITED EACH PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE TO TALK ABOUT TERRORISM. TO TALK ABOUT TERRORISM WITH ME
AND OTHER RETIRED ADMIRALS AND
GENERALS. OF ALL THE CANDIDATES WE MET WITH, HILLARY CLINTON WAS BY FAR
THE BEST PREPARED AND MOST
KNOWLEDGEABLE. SHE LISTEN CAREFULLY TO OUR ARGUMENTS. SHE TESTED US.
WE HAD MORE THAN 500 YEARS OF COLLECTIVE EXPERIENCE AND WE
LEARNED FROM HER. THIS IS BEFORE SHE SERVED AS OUR
SECRETARY OF STATE. BEFORE SHE BROKERED A PEACE FIRE IN GAZA.
BEFORE SHE RALLIED THE WORLD TO SECTION IRAN -- SANCTION IRAN AND ADVISED OBAMA TO TAKE OUT
OSAMA BIN LADEN.
AND SHE RESTORED OUR REPUTATION
IN THE WORLD.
[CHEERS] ANYONE WHO SERVED WITH THE YOUNG
MEN AND WOMEN IN OUR ARMED
FORCES KNOWS HOW SERIOUS IT IS
TO SEND THEM TO HARM'S WAY. WHEN YOU ARE A SOLDIER, SERMON
-- SAILOR, RING, HE DON'T GET TO
CHOOSE YOUR COMMANDERS. WHEN YOU ARE A CITIZEN, TO HAVE
THE RESPONSIBILITY TO CHOOSE A COMMANDER WHO WILL KEEP US SAFE, STRONG, AND SECURE. CHOOSE HILLARY.
[CHEERS] THANK YOU.
[CHEERS]
>> PLEASE WELCOME KRISTEN CAVANAUGH FROM SAN DIEGO,
CALIFORNIA.
