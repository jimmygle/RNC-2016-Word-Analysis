<strong>GOVERNOR CUOMO</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> GOVERNOR CUOMO: HE WAS A 12-YEAR GOVERNOR OF THE GREAT STATE OF NEW YORK, MARIO CUOMO. HE GAVE A KEYNOTE SPEECH AT THE 1984 HIM ACCREDIT CONVENTION THAT<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> FOR MANY PEOPLE DEFINED THE VALUES AND THE PRINCIPLES OF THE
DEMOCRATIC PARTY AND INSTRUCTED
ME ON HOW TO LEAD MY
PROFESSIONAL LIFE AS AN ELECTED OFFICIAL, AND HE LOVED BEING A
DEMOCRAT.
[APPLAUSE] HE SPOKE ABOUT THE 1984 ELECTION, AND THE 1984 ELECTION WAS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT WAS ABOUT TWO OPPOSING PHILOSOPHIES
MORE THAN TWO PEOPLE. EVEN MORE PROFOUNDLY THIS
NOVEMBER IS NOT WHICH PERSONAL PARTY WINS OR LOSES. AT STAKE IN THIS ELECTION, MY FRIENDS, IS THE VERY SOUL OF
AMERICA. LAST WEEK, WE HEARD REPUBLICANS
LAY OUT THEIR STRATEGY. UNFORTUNATELY, IT OFFERED NO NEW
SOLUTIONS.
BUT IT'S CLEAR THAT THEIR PLAN IS TO FAN THE FLAMES OF FEAR AND
TO OFFER A SCAPEGOAT FOR ALL OUR PROBLEMS.
THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN IS MARKETING
A GREAT DISTRACTION USING
PEOPLE'S FEAR AND ANXIETY TO
DRIVE HIS RATINGS. THEIR MESSAGE COMES DOWN TO THIS
-- THE AFRAID OF PEOPLE WHO ARE DIFFERENT. BE AFRAID OF DIFFERENT RELIGIONS AND DIFFERENT COLORS AND DIFFERENT LANGUAGES. STOP IMMIGRATION.
THEY BELIEVE THE NATION WILL AUTOMATICALLY RISE. IT'S NOT RIGHT. IT'S DIVISIVE. IT'S DELUSIONAL, AND WE MUST
EXPOSE THE TRUTH TO THE PEOPLE
OF THIS NATION. NOW, REPUBLICANS ARE SUFFERING
FROM SHORT-TERM MEMORY LOSS. UNLESS REPUBLICANS ARE ALL NATIVE AMERICANS, THEN THEY ARE
IMMIGRANTS, TOO.

<strong>GOVERNOR CUOMO</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> GOVERNOR CUOMO: IF WE LISTEN TO
THE REPUBLICANS, THEY WOULD CUT
THIS NATION IN HALF AND TURN ONE AGAINST THE OTHER.
IT WOULD TAKE OUR GREATEST STRENGTH,<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> WHICH IS OUR
DIVERSITY, AND IT WOULD MAKE IT
A WEAKNESS, AND WE ARE NOT GOING
TO LET THAT HAPPEN TO OUR
AMERICA.
[APPLAUSE] NOW, MY FRIENDS, FEAR IS A POWERFUL WEAPON. IT CAN EXCITE AND MOTIVATE, AND
IT CAN GET PEOPLE TO YELL AND TO SCREAM.
FEAR CAN EVEN BRING YOU INTO
POWER, BUT FEAR HAS NEVER
CREATED A JOB, AND FEAR HAS
NEVER EDUCATED A CHILD, AND HERE HAS NEVER BUILT A HOME AND FEAR
HAS NEVER BUILT A COMMUNITY, AND FEAR WILL NEVER BUILD A NATION.
[APPLAUSE] AND LET THEM REMEMBER -- WHEN THEY SELL FEAR, FEAR IS NOT STRENGTH. FEAR IS WEAKNESS. NO MATTER HOW LOUD YOU YELL, OUR
AMERICA IS NEVER WEEK.
-- NEVER WEAK.
[APPLAUSE] GOVERNOR CUOMO REPUBLICANS SAY
THEY WANT TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT
AGAIN.
THEY SAY THEY WANT TO TAKE US
BACK TO THE OLD DAYS, THE GOOD
OLD DAYS. I WANT TO KNOW WHAT GOOD OLD
DAYS THEY WANT TO TAKE US BACK
TO.
DO THEY WANT TO TAKE US BACK BEFORE THE CIVIL RIGHTS ACT? DO THEY

OR DO THEY WANT TO TAKE US BACK
BEFORE ROE V WADE? WE HAVE A DIFFERENT VISION.
WE ARE NOT GOING BACK. WE ARE GOING FORWARD. THEY SAID THEY WANT TO MAKE
AMERICA GREATER THAN EVER
BEFORE. WE SAY, YOU HAVEN'T SEEN
ANYTHING YET.
[CHEERS] YOU WATCH WHAT WE DO WITH AMERICA. YOU THINK AMERICA IS GREAT NOW, IMAGINE HOW GREAT AMERICA COULD BE WHEN EVERY CHILD RICH AND POOR IS FULLY EDUCATED TO THEIR GOD-GIVEN TALENT.
[CHEERS] LET'S BE HONEST, RIGHT NOW IN
THIS COUNTRY WE HAVE TWO
EDUCATION SYSTEMS. NOT PUBLIC AND PRIVATE, BUT RICH
AND POOR. AND YOU GET TO A SCHOOL ON THE
RICH SIDE OF TOWN AND THEY WILL SHOW YOU HOW IN THE FIRST GRADE ALL THE CHILDREN ARE ON LAPTOP
COMPUTERS.
AND YOU GO TO A SCHOOL ON THE
POOR SIDE OF TOWN, AND YOU WILL SEE THE MOST SOPHISTICATED PIECE
OF ELECTRONIC EQUIPMENT IS THE
METAL DETECTOR YOU WALK THROUGH
ON THE WAY TO THE CLASSROOM.
THAT IS NOT EDUCATING EVERY
CHILD EQUALLY.
[CHEERS] YOU THINK AMERICA IS STRONG. IMAGINE HOW STRONG WE WILL BE
WHEN WE TRULY HEED MARLEE THE KINGS WISDOM AND JUST PEOPLE BY
CONTENT OF CHARACTER AND NOT
COLOR OF SKIN.
[CHEERS] IMAGINE HOW STRONG WE WILL BE WHEN WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE GREATEST FEAT IS THE ONE ENJOYED
BY THE MOST PEOPLE AT THE TABLE. IMAGINE HOW STRONG WE WILL BE WHEN OUR GOVERNMENT HAS THE
STRENGTH TO FIGHT FOR FREEDOM, BUT THE INTELLIGENCE TO KNOW
THAT THE STRONGEST FOUR LETTER
WORD IS NOT HATE, BUT LOVE.
[CHEERS] WE KNOW WHAT THE REPUBLICANS WILL SAY, REPUBLICANS WILL SAY THOSE DEMOCRATS, THEY ARE JUST DREAMERS. THEY CAN MAKE IT HAPPEN. WELL MAYBE WE ARE DREAMERS, BUT
WE ARE ALSO DOERS.
FDR LIFTED A NATION FROM DEPRESSION, JFK LAUNCHED OUR MISSION TO THE MOON, LBJ AND VOTING RIGHTS, PRESIDENT OBAMA DELIVERED HEALTH CARE COVERAGE FOR 20 MILLION UNINSURED AMERICANS.
[CHEERS] AND MARIO, WAS A DREAMER, TOO. OUR PROGRESSIVE GOVERNMENT IS
WORKING IN NEW YORK.
WE RAISE THE MINIMUM WAGE TO
$15. THE HIGHEST IN THE NATION.
[CHEERS] WE INSIST ON ECONOMIC JUSTICE.
[CHEERS] WE DID NOT GET PAID FAMILY LEAVE BECAUSE ALL WORKERS DESERVE DIGNITY.
[CHEERS] WE ARE REBUILDING OUR MIDDLE
CLASS AND WE ARE WORKING
HAND-IN-HAND WITH ORGANIZED LABOR BECAUSE THE MIDDLE CLASS IS THE BACKBONE OF THE SOCIETY.
[CHEERS] WE ARE PROTECTING THE ENVIRONMENT BANNING FRACKING PEOPLE.
THIS IS THE ONLY PLANET WE HAVE.
[CHEERS] WE THOUGHT THE NRA AND WE WON
AND WE OUTLAWED ASSAULT WEAPONS
TO KEEP THEM FROM THE HANDS OF MAD MEN WHO WORK KILLING INNOCENT.
[CHEERS] AND WE PASSED MARRIAGE EQUALITY AND GENDER AND WE DID IT NOT
BECAUSE THE SUPREME COURT SAID
WE MUST LEGALLY, BUT BECAUSE PEOPLE BELIEVED WE SHOULD MORALLY.
[CHEERS] NOW, THESE ARE NOT JUST. THESE ARE REALITIES. PROGRESSIVE GOVERNMENT WORKS AND WE HAVE PROVED PROGRESSIVE GOVERNMENT WORKS AND WE DID IT TOGETHER WITHOUT LEAVING ANYONE BEHIND AND WITHOUT LEAVING
ANYONE OUT. BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THAT WE ARE ALL INTERCONNECTED AND ALL
INTERRELATED. WE ARE ONE. WE SAY THAT THERE IS A COURT THAT YOU TO YOU AND ME. THAT CORD IS FABRIC.
WHEN ONE OF US IS LOWERED WE ARE
ALL LOWERED. THE REPUBLICAN SENATE OUR VISION
OF COMMUNITY CAN'T WORK. BUT WE KNOW IT CAN AND WE KNOW
IT WILL. WE HAVE SEEN IT HAPPEN. WE HAVE SEEN IT UP CLOSE. 15 YEARS AGO, ON SEPTEMBER 11,
WE SAW DEATH AND WE SAW
DESTRUCTION. AND WE SAW UNIMAGINABLE HORROR
AND CRUELTY.
WE ALSO SAW SOMETHING ELSE. WE SAW THIS NATION COME TOGETHER LIKE IT HAD NEVER COME TOGETHER BEFORE. WE WERE NOT TEXANS OR
CALIFORNIANS ARE NEW YORKERS, WE
WERE AMERICANS. WE WERE NOT DEMOCRATS OR REPUBLICANS, WE WERE AMERICANS. WE WERE NOT MUSLIMS AND
CHRISTIANS OR JEWS, WE WERE
AMERICANS. WE WEREN'T LACK OR WHITE OR BROWN, WE WERE READ AND WHITE
AND BLUE. THOSE ARE THE ONLY COLORS THAT
MATTER IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.
[CHEERS] IN THAT MOMENT WE WERE ONE AND WE ACHIEVED COMMUNITY AND WE
WERE THERE FOR EACH OTHER. WE WERE THERE THE WAY A FAMILY IS THERE. WE CRIED TOGETHER, WE MOURNS TOGETHER AND WE GOT UP AND WE REBUILT TOGETHER AND THAT WAS
AMERICA AT ITS BEST.
[CHEERS] TODAY, THE FREEDOM TOWER STAND TALLER THAN EVER BEFORE.
IT IS A MONUMENT TO THE FACT THAT WHEN THIS COUNTRY COMES
TOGETHER, THERE IS NOTHING WE
CANNOT ACCOUNT WHICH -- ACCOMPLISH AND NOTHING WE CAN
DO.
-- CAN'T DO.
[CHEERS] OUT OF MANY, ONE. THAT IS OUR FOUNDING PREMISE. IT IS OUR ENDURING PROMISE. THAT IS OUR GOAL FOR THIS NATION
AND HILLARY CLINTON IS THE
PERSON TO MAKE IT A REALITY.
[CHEERS] NOW, I SPENT EIGHT YEARS IN THE
CLINTON ADMINISTRATION. I WORKED WITH HILLARY CLINTON
EVERY DAY. I'VE BEEN ALL OVER THE WORLD
WITH HER.
I'VE SEEN HER IN THE TRENCHES
AND THE GOOD DAYS AND THE BAD DAYS, SHE STOOD ON THE WORLD STAGE AND DECLARED THAT HUMAN
RIGHTS ARE WOMEN RIGHTS AND
WOMEN RIGHTS ARE HUMAN RIGHTS.
[CHEERS] SHE THOUGHT THE HEALTH CARE -- FOUGHT FOR HEALTH CARE FOR ALL
AMERICANS. SHE REPAIRED AMERICA'S REPUTATION WORLDWIDE AS
SECRETARY OF STATE.
AND MY FRIENDS, SHE WON'T JUST
SHATTERED THE GLASS CEILING, FOR MY DAUGHTERS AND YOUR DAUGHTERS, SHE WILL PROVIDE A NEW ROLE MODEL FOR AN ENTIRE NEW
GENERATION OF WOMEN. SHE ALSO HAS THE VISION AND QUALIFICATIONS TO BE A
TRANSFORMATIVE FORCE FOR THIS
NATION.
[CHEERS] SHE WILL UNIFY, NOT DIVIDE YOUR SHE WILL MOVE US FORWARD TOGETHER AS ONE. THAT IS WHY WE MUST MAKE HILLARY CLINTON THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THESE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.
[CHEERS] AND LAST POINT, MY FRIENDS, THAT WAS THE ACCENT OF MY FATHER'S
MESSAGE IN 1984.
AND THAT MESSAGE IS TIMELESS. MY FATHER WAS A KEYNOTE SPEAKER
FOR THIS NATION'S BETTER ANGELS AND HE WAS BEAUTIFUL. AND TONIGHT, DAD, WHEREVER YOU ARE, AND I THINK I KNOW WHERE,
AT THIS TIME OF FEAR, PLEASE
HELP THIS COUNTRY REMEMBER WHAT
TRULY MAKES A GREAT THAT WE ARE ONE NATION UNDER GOD, INDIVISIBLE WITH LIBERTY AND JUSTICE FOR ALL. THANK YOU AND GOD BLESS YOU.
