GENERATION? WILL YOU JOIN ME AND SUPPORT A LEADER WHO UNDERSTANDS THAT THE DEEP RACIAL WOUNDS OF OUR
COUNTRY HAVE NOT YET HEALED, BUT TOGETHER, WE CAN WORK TO BE THE CHANGE WE WISH TO SEE IN THE
WORLD? WILL YOU STAND WITH THE LEADER WHO HAS TO FIND HER LIFE BY HELPING THE LEAST AMONG US? WHO, GOING DOWN TO SEGREGATED ALABAMA AS A LAW STUDENT, TO
WORKING WITH THE CHILDREN'S
DEFENSE FUND, TO FIGHTING FOR HEALTH CARE FOR CHILDREN ACROSS THIS NATION, AND TO STAND UP AND PROUDLY PROCLAIM TO WOMEN EVERYWHERE FOR CLAIMING THAT WOMEN'S RIGHTS ARE HUMAN RIGHTS, AND HUMAN RIGHTS ARE WOMEN'S
RIGHT. COME ON, Y'ALL. THE STAKES ARE TOO HIGH. THE CONSEQUENCES ARE TOO SEVERE. IN CLEVELAND LAST WEEK, THE RNC
NOMINATED A MAN WHO HAS DEFINED
HIS CAMPAIGN ON WORDS THAT DIVIDE US AND WALLS THAT DIVIDE US, AND THEY APPROVED A PARTY PLATFORM THAT ENSHRINES INTOLERANCE. WITHIN, WHETHER YOU -- LISTEN,
WHETHER YOU ARE A REPUBLICAN, OR
DEMOCRAT, AN INDEPENDENT,
WHETHER YOU ARE BLACK, WHITE,
LATINO, OR ASIAN, WHETHER YOU
ARE GAY, STRAIGHT, OR TRANSGENDERED, WHETHER YOU RUN A RANCH, A FARM, A CHURCH, OR A
BEAUTY STOP DOWN IN MEMPHIS, TENNESSEE, SECRETARY CLINTON IS
A FIGHTER FOR US ALL. Y'ALL, THESE NEXT FEW MONTHS WOULD BE EASY, BUT WHEN HAS
FIGHTING FOR WHAT'S RIGHT EVER BEEN EASY? WE ARE MORE POWERFUL THAN WE CARE THINK IF WE ARE WILLING TO
WORK TOGETHER. WE ARE STRONGER TOGETHER.</span><span class='hidden-full-transcript-ellipses'>...</span></p><a href='#' class='hidden-full-transcript-link'><i class='icon-chevron-down'></i> <span class='link-show-full-text'>Show Full Text</span><i class='icon-chevron-up'></i> <span class='link-show-less-text'>Show Less Text</span></a>
