<p class='short_transcript'> >> IN 1935, I JOINED IN PASSING IN CONGRESS. TWO YEARS LATER WE WERE JOINED
BY THREE OTHERS. WE MADE A DIFFERENCE FOR
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE IN OUR
COUNTRY.<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> RELATED THE EFFORT ON THE
PASSAGE OF TITLE IX WHICH OPENED
DOORS TO WOMEN BY LIMITING SEX
DISCRIMINATION IN EDUCATION. WE LED THE EFFORTS FOR THE PASSAGE OF THE BILL THAT APOLOGIZED TO JAPANESE-AMERICANS INCARCERATED DURING WORLD WAR II
AND PROVIDED REDRESS. DANIEL AKAKA LED THE APOLOGY RESOLUTION FOR THE U.S.
OVERTHREW THE KINGDOM OF HAWAII. WE FORMED A CAUCUS WITH A GROWING NUMBER OF ASIAN HAWAII
AND PACIFIC ISLANDER MEMBERS OF
CONGRESS. WE LAID THE GROUNDWORK FOR OUR GOVERNMENT, SO TODAY THE NUMBER
IN OFFICE ARE GOING, AND SO IS
THEIR LEADERSHIP. JUDY CHU WAS ABLE TO PASS THE RESOLUTION OF REDRESS FOR THE CHINESE EXCLUSION ACT OF 1882. IN THIS PAST YEAR, WE PASSED LEGISLATION ELIMINATING DEROGATORY LAWS RELATING TO
MINORITIES. WE CAME TOGETHER TO HAVE A
GREATER VOICE IN D.C. AND THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY. WE LEARNED FROM THE LESSONS OF THE PAST TO FIGHT FOR A BETTER
FUTURE. WHEN THOSE MAKING THE DECISIONS LOOK LIKE AMERICA, EVERYBODY IN
AMERICA BENEFITS.</span><span class='hidden-full-transcript-ellipses'>...</span></p><a href='#' class='hidden-full-transcript-link'><i class='icon-chevron-down'></i> <span class='link-show-full-text'>Show Full Text</span><i class='icon-chevron-up'></i> <span class='link-show-less-text'>Show Less Text</span></a>
