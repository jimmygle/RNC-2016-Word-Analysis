<strong>Unidentified Speaker</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> ON TONY GOLDWYN.
I'M HERE IN PHILADELPHIA STANDING IN THE SMB RIM OF
INDEPENDENCE HALL. IT IS HARD TO BELIEVE, THIS
RELATIVELY SMALL ROOM IS THE BIRTHPLACE<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> OF OUR GREAT NATION. THE YEAR WAS 1776. IT WAS HOT. NOT JUST THE WEATHER. THE PATRIOTS HAD ALREADY STARTED FIGHTING THE MIGHTY EMPIRE IN
THE WORLD.
THIS IS WHERE THEY GATHER TO
FINALLY WRITE FREE AND DECLARE
BREAK FREE AND DECLARE THAT HERE
IN AMERICA WE MUST BE IN CONTROL
OF OUR DESTINY. WE HAVE AN UNALIENABLE RIGHT TO
LIFE, LIBERTY AND THE PURSUIT OF
HAPPINESS. A FEW YEARS LATER, RIGHT HERE IN THIS ROOM, OUR YOUNG COUNTRY
THROUGHOUT THE CONSTITUTION, A BLUEPRINT FOR THE DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT WHICH MAY BE UNITED STATES THE GREATEST COUNTRY ON
EARTH. THE WORDS WRITTEN HERE CENTURIES AGO GIVE US THE FREEDOM TO SPEAK
OUR MIND, WORSHIP AS WE CHOOSE
AND TO SELECT OUR OWN
GOVERNMENT. WHY FOUND IN GOVERNMENT -- DOCUMENTS WERE POWERFUL, THEY
WERE NOT PERFECT. WOMEN AND AFRICAN-AMERICANS CANNOT VOTE. NOT ONE OF THE GUYS DEBITED.
IT BACK THEN COULD HAVE IMAGINED
WHAT YOU ARE DOING THIS WEEK,
NONE OF THEM. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA OR A
PRESIDENT HILLARY CLINTON. HOWEVER, THE FRAMERS KNEW THAT
LIFE IN THEIR TIME SHOULD NOT DETERMINE LIFE FOR ALL TIME.
THE FUTURE OF THE COUNTRY WOULD
BE UP TO US.
IN EACH GENERATION, AMERICANS
FROM ALL WALKS OF LIFE AND ALL AGES HAS TO TO PERFECT THE UNION
ARE FROM RESTRICTED. FREDERICK DOUGLAS, LEANNE WOOD GARRISON -- WILLIAM LLOYD GARRISON, THE 200 WOMAN WHO
GATHERED AT SENECA FALLS, A
SEAMSTRESS NAMED ROSA PARKS WHO
BY SETTING DOWN STOOD UP. LATINO FARMWORKERS WHO CAME TOGETHER TO SECURE BASIC DIGNITY
FOR HARD WORK. AND OUR LGBT BROTHERS AND
SISTERS WHO TOOK A STAND AT STONEWALL SO THEY COULD BE WHO THEY ARE AND LOVE WHO THEY WANT. BECAUSE OF WHAT THEY DID, WE ARE STRONGER AS A NATION. WE HAD THE TALENT OF ALL OF PEOPLE. IT IS ONLY BY WORKING TOGETHER
AND LOOKING OUT FOR EACH OTHER
THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO SEE THE
PROMISE OF OUR FOUNDERS. ORDINARY PEOPLE OUGHT TO BE OFFICE OF AMERICA'S EXTRA NICE
STORY.
-- EXTRAORDINARY STORY. A STORY OF PROGRESS AND
POSSIBILITY.
WHAT BECOMES OF THE NEXT CHAPTER
IS IN YOUR HANDS.
OUR NATION FACES A LOT OF BIG TOWNS IS -- CHALLENGES AND
HISTORY HAS SHOWN WE WILL MEET
THEM IF WE ARE ACTIVE, ENGAGED
AND INVOLVED. I WANT TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING. THIS IS THE CHAIR WHERE GEORGE
WASHINGTON SAT DURING THE DISCUSSION. ONE OF THE FEATURES IS THE SON
-- SUN.AND AFTER THE
PRESENTATION WAS FINISHED
, A BEN FRANKLIN TURNED TO HIS
DELICATE AND SAID I'VE OFTEN
LOOKED UP AT BEHIND THE PRESIDENT WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO TELL WHETHER IT WAS RISING OR
SETTING, NOW I KNOW, IT IS A RISING SUN. THAT IS THE STORY OF AMERICA. AND I ASK ALL OF YOU TO DO YOUR
PART AND MAKE SURE THAT IN ALL
THE DAYS THAT DON ON THIS, THE PRINCIPAL AND VALUES HERE, FREEDOM, EQUALITY, COMMUNITY, OPPORTUNITY ARE PROMISES KEPT
FOR EVERY AMERICAN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
