<strong>Jesse Lipson</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> I DON'T KNOW ABOUT YOU, BUT DONALD TRUMP'S ACCEPTANCE SPEECH LEFT ME WITH A LOT OF QUESTIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, WHERE IS THIS
LOSING COUNTRY HE KEEPS TALKING<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> ABOUT?
THE AMERICAN I LIVE IN, THE NORTH CAROLINA I LIVE IN IS A CREATIVE ENGINE WHERE THE
INNOVATIVE SPIRIT IS ALIVE AND
WELL. WHERE NEARLY WE ALL HAVE -- ALL
NEW JOBS ARE GREETED BY
STARTUPS. YOU CAN STILL MAKE SOMETHING FROM NOTHING LIKE I DID. I TAUGHT MYSELF HOW TO BUILD
SOFTWARE ON NIGHTS AND WEEKENDS.
WHEN I WAS 26, I STARTED MY COMPANY WITH $100 IN ADVERTISING. TODAY, WE ARE IN MORE THAN 100
COUNTRIES AND WE HAVE CREATED A
HUNDRED JOBS AND RALLY -- IN RALEIGH.
[CHEERING] DONNA, I'M ALSO A BUSINESSMAN.
-- DONALD, I'M ALSO A
BUSINESSMAN. YOU BUILD SKYSCRAPERS, I BUILD
IN THE CLOUD. IT IS CLEAR THAT YOU DO NOT
UNDERSTAND SOMETHING SIMPLE
ABOUT BUSINESS. NOTHING SCARES AWAY INVESTMENT LIKE KATE.
-- HATE.
[CHEERING] DISCUSSING LAWS LIKE NORTH
CAROLINA'S ATTACK ON LGBT
AMERICANS ARE CAUSED IN MY STATE
-- COSTING MY STATE HUNDREDS OF
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS.
A CAUSE OF THE NBA ALL-STAR GAME AND IT IS ALSO COSTING US
TALENTED PROGRAMMERS WHO ARE READY TO BUILD THE FUTURE. I HAVE SEEN VENTURE CAPITALISTS
WHO REFUSE TO INVEST IN OUR STATE. REPUBLICANS MAY THINK THEY ARE TELLING PEOPLE WHICH BATHROOM TO
GO INTO, BUT THEY'RE ACTUALLY TELLING PEOPLE WHICH MARKET TO
STAY OUT OF.
[CHEERING] WHEN I TRAVEL ABROAD, I HEAR
PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT LEGALIZING
-- LEGALIZE DETERMINATION IN AMERICA. BIGOTRY DOES NOT JUST HURT MY
STATE, IT HURTS OUR ENTIRE COUNTRY. IT IS NOT JUST NORTH CAROLINA, IN INDIANA, MIKE PENCE APPROVED
DISCRIMINATION AGAINST LGBT
AMERICANS.
>> BOO!
>> I GUESS YOU COULD SAY THAT
THE TREE HAS CREATED ONE JOB -- BIGOTRY HAS GRADED ONE JOB, THE POSITION OF DONALD TRUMP'S
RUNNING MATE. HILLARY CLINTON IS THAT EVERY GREAT CEO KNOWS.
WE ARE STRONGER TOGETHER. THAT IS WHY SHE SUPPORTS A
FEDERAL LAW AFFECTING WORKERS IN THE WORKPLACE. NO MATTER WHO THEY LOVE OR WHO
THEY ARE. SHE WILL CUT TAXES AND REGULATIONS FOR STARTUPS AND SMALL BUSINESSES SO THAT THEY
CAN HIRE AND GROW. HE WILL INVEST IN BREAKTHROUGH TECHNOLOGIES OF THE INDUSTRY AND
JOBS OF THE FUTURE ARE CREATED
HERE IN AMERICA.
[CHEERING] SHE WILL HELP LIFT THE BURDEN OF COLLEGE DEBT SO YOUNG PEOPLE CAN
TAKE THEIR DREAMS.
[CHEERING] I TELL MY EMPLOYS ALL THE TIME, FOCUS ON SOLUTIONS, NOT PROBLEM. ALL DONALD TRUMP OFFERS ARE PROBLEMS. HE OFFERS REAL SOLUTIONS. AMERICA, THERE IS NO QUESTION THAT HILLARY CLINTON MUST BE OUR
NEXT PRESIDENT.
[CHEERING] THANK YOU.

<strong>Unidentified Speaker</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> LGBT AMERICANS ARE OUR
COLLEAGUES, TEACHERS, SOLDIERS,
FRIENDS, OUR LOVED ONES. THEY ARE FULL AND EQUAL CITIZENS AND DESERVE THE RIGHTS OF
CITIZENSHIP.<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> TO DENY OPPORTUNITY TO ANY OF
OUR DAUGHTERS AND SONS, SOLELY
ON THE BASIS OF WHO THEY ARE AND
WHO THEY LOVE IS TO DENY THEM THE CHANCE TO LIVE UP TO THEIR
OWN GOD-GIVEN POTENTIAL. FROM STONEWALL TO LARAMIE AND NOW ORLANDO, WE HAVE SEEN TOO MANY EXAMPLES OF HOW THE
STRUGGLE TO LIVE FREELY, OPENLY
AND WITHOUT FEAR HAS BEEN MET BY VIOLENCE. WE HAVE TO STAND TOGETHER, BE PROUD TOGETHER, THERE IS NO BETTER REBUKE TO THE TERRORISTS
AND ALL THOSE WHO HATE. THE STAKES IN THIS ELECTION ARE
HIGH. I THINK ABOUT ALL THOSE MILLIONS OF WORRIES LARGE AND SMALL THAT SAME-SEX PARENTS AND LGBT
AMERICANS THINK ABOUT EVERY DAY. I'M GOING TO KEEP AS I HAVE
THROUGHOUT MY LIFE FIGHTING FOR
YOU, HE WRITES, YOUR CHILDREN AND YOUR FUTURES. I AM PROUD TO BE FIGHTING RIGHT
ALONGSIDE YOU.
[CHEERING] LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, PLEASE
WELCOME STATE SENATOR PAT
SPEARMAN FROM NEVADA.
