<strong>Raul Grijalva</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> MR. GRIJALVA: GOOD EVENING. I STAND HERE IN SUPPORT OF HILLARY CLINTON. ON BEHALF OF OUR FUTURE AND IN
RECOGNITION OF OUR PROUD PAST, I
AM REMINDED TODAY<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> OF ALL THE
IMPORTANT FIGHTS OF THE PAST 50 YEARS, FOUGHT AND WON BY
PROGRESSIVE LEADERS OF OUR
PARTY. I CAME OF AGE -- FOR WOMEN'S RIGHTS, FOR CLEAN AIR, CLEAN
WATER, AND FOR PEACE, AND THE MANY OTHER GREAT -- IN THIS COUNTRY THAT MADE IT A BETTER
PLACE. I CAME OF AGE WITH A PARTY THAT BELIEVED THE PUBLIC GOOD, NOT
THE SIZE OF A DONOR'S CHECK, WAS THE TRUE MEASURE OF AN IDEA. AND, MY FRIENDS, A NEW GENERATION IS COMING OF AGE
TODAY. MILLIONS OF YOUNG PEOPLE, ALL ETHNICITIES, ALL BACKGROUNDS,
ALL INCOME LEVELS, ARE LOOKING
FOR US TO STAY TRUE TO THE PARTY'S GREAT IDEALS.
THEY LOOK TO OUR HOPE THAT WE
WILL PUT THEIR NEEDS ABOVE THOSE OF THE ALREADY RICH AND
POWERFUL. THEIR IDEALISM, THEIR OPTIMISM,
THEIR BELIEF IN AMERICA, THEY
ARE NO DIFFERENT THAN THE IDEALISM THAT BUILT THIS NATION
OR THE IDEALISM THAT WON PROGRESSIVE FIGHTS OF A
GENERATION AGO. THEIR IDEALISM IS JUST AS POWERFUL AND, YES, JUST AS FRAGILE. IN THIS ELECTION AND IN EVERYTHING WE DO, WE MUST REMEMBER THAT AND BE WORTHY OF IT.
I WOULD NOT BE HERE TODAY
SUPPORTING OUR NOMINEE IF THE
DEMOCRATS OF 50 YEARS HAD NOT
HAD THEIR CURRENT. I WOULD NOT BE HERE IF OUR PARTY
WAS BUILT IN THE LIKES OF DONALD
TRUMP WHO IS TRYING TO MAKE OUR
COUNTRY MEET HER, APRIL, MORE
DIVIDED, AND MORE FEARFUL. I AM PROUD TO BE PART OF A
MOVEMENT THAT IS GOING TO BEAT
RONALD TRUMP.
-- DONALD TRUMP, THAT IS GOING
TO HELP ELECT HILLARY CLINTON. THAT IDEALISM IS A GOVERNING PHILOSOPHY WE SHOULD BE PROUD
OF.
NOW IT IS TIME. LET'S GO WIN THIS.
LET'S WIN IT FOR OUR PEOPLE. AND LET'S WIN IT FOR OUR NATION. THANK YOU.</span><span class='hidden-full-transcript-ellipses'>...</span></p><a href='#' class='hidden-full-transcript-link'><i class='icon-chevron-down'></i> <span class='link-show-full-text'>Show Full Text</span><i class='icon-chevron-up'></i> <span class='link-show-less-text'>Show Less Text</span></a>
