<p class='short_transcript'> >> GOOD EVENING. I'M PROUD TO BE HERE IN MY HOMETOWN OF PHILADELPHIA. AND I'M EVEN PROUDER TO
REPRESENT THE 3 MILLION MEMBERS
OF THE NORTH AMERICAN BUILDING
TRADE<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> UNION. TRADE UNION MEMBERS HAVE HELPED
OF THIS GREAT NATION.
THE SUPER DOWN, THE GOLDING GATE BRIDGE, THE FREEDOM TOWERS, IRINA WE ARE IN TONIGHT. YOU NAME IT, WE BUILD IT. WE ARE PROUD OF OUR WORK. BUT WITH COLLAPSED BRIDGES,
COMING ROADS AND STRESS ENERGY
SYSTEMS, WE NOTICED HAVE TIME TO
REBUILD OUR NATION'S INFRASTRUCTURE. BUILDING TRADE NUMBERS ARE READY
TO DO THEIR PART. HILLARY CLINTON HAS THE BOLDEST
INFRASTRUCTURE PLAN WE HAVE SEEN
IN GENERATIONS. SHE WILL HELP US REPAIR ROADS
AND BRIDGES AND MAKE BROADBAND UNIVERSAL.
BUILD NEW AIRPORTS AND MODERNIZE THE ENERGY GRID.
SHE WILL DO IT ALL WHILE CREATING GOOD, FAIR PAINT JOBS WITH STANDARDS THAT SUPPORT REAL PARTNERSHIP PROGRAMS WHICH THE
BUILDING TRADES PIONEER. SO WORKERS GET THE SKILLS THEY
NEED TO SUCCEED. LET ME BE VERY CLEAR, WE CANNOT REBUILD AMERICA UNLESS WE TREAT AMERICAN WORKERS WITH RESPECT.
[CHEERING] DONALD TRUMP JOSIE RUNNING MATE
THAT DOES NOT RESPECT WORKERS.
AS GOVERNOR, MIKE PENCE GAVE CORPORATIONS LICENSE TO PAY CONSTRUCTION WORKERS MUST BY REPEALING THE PREVAILING WAGE LAW THAT HAS BEEN IN PLACE FOR
EIGHT YEARS. THAT WAS A BAD DEAL FOR INDIANA
AND A BAD DEAL FOR AMERICA. THAT IS WHY HARDHATS, ALL ACROSS AMERICA SUPPORT HILLARY CLINTON, AND HONORARY IRONWORKER TIM
KAINE.
[CHEERING] THEY HAVE OUR PARKS -- BACKS AND
WE HAVE THEIRS.
[CHEERING] LET'S GET THEM ELECTED.

<strong>Randi Weingarten</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> BROTHERS AND SISTERS. I'M PROUD TO BE HERE REPRESENTING THE 1.6 MILLION MEMBERS OF THE OF THE AST.
-- AFT.LAST WEEK WE SAW A
FESTIVAL OF FEAR. EVERY<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> DAY WAS FULL OF HATE. WHY? TO HIDE THAT TRUMPS PLAN LIKE
MANY OF HIS BUSINESSES ARE COMPLETELY BANKRUPT. DONALD MADE MILLIONS WHILE HE
RIPPED OFF WORKERS AND SMALL BUSINESSES WITH HIS UNFAIR
BUSINESS PRACTICES. REMEMBER, HE ENDED UP BANKRUPTING NOT ONE, NOT TWO, NOT THREE, BUT FOR OF HIS COMPANIES -- BUT FOUR OF HIS COMPANIES.
AND HIS ECONOMIC IDEAS WILL MAKE MILLIONAIRES LIKE HIM RICHER AT THE EXPENSE OF THE MIDDLE CLASS. JUST LOOK AT TRUMP UNIVERSITY TO SEE HOW HE OPERATES. SALESPEOPLE WERE TOLD TO EXPLOIT PEOPLE'S FEARS. AND I QUOTE, A SINGLE PARENT
THAT MAY NEED MONEY FOR FOOD INTO USELESS HIGH COST SEMINARS. INSTEAD OF AN EDUCATION, STUDENTS LOST THOUSANDS OF
DOLLARS AND GOT NOTHING IN
RETURN. THAT IS TRUMP IN A NUTSHELL. MANIPULATING PEOPLE'S FEARS TO ENRICH HIMSELF. HE IS COMPLETELY UNQUALIFIED TO BE IN THE OVAL OFFICE.
[CHEERING] THANKFULLY, WE HAVE A DIFFERENT CHOICE AND IT IS A GREAT ONE.
HILLARY CLINTON.
[CHEERING] SHE HAS WORKED HER ENTIRE LIFE
TO LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD FOR
WORKING FAMILIES. THAT'S US OF PUBLIC EDUCATION FROM PRE-K TO COLLEGE. A PLAN FOR UNIVERSAL EARLY
CHILDHOOD EDUCATION. SHE WILL READ SET EDUCATION
POLICIES THAT FOCUS ON CREATING CREATIVITY AND CRITICAL THINKING, NOT TOO MUCH TESTING.
[CHEERING] AND SHE WILL MAKE PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES FREE FOR WORKING
FAMILIES. A STARK CONTRAST FROM DONALD TRUMP'S FOR PROFIT SCAM.
HELLER IS THE MOST QUALIFIED CANDIDATE -- HILLARY IS THE MOST QUALIFIED CANDIDATE TO RUN IN MY
LIFETIME. THE TOYS COULD NOT BE CLEAR. WE MUST ELECT HILLARY CLINTON
AND TIM KAINE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
