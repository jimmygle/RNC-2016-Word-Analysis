<p class='short_transcript'> >> WHEN YOU LOSE A SPOUSE, YOU
KNOW YOUR LIFE WILL CHANGE
FOREVER.
YOU KNOW IT WILL NOT BE EASY. BUT I DID NOT EXPECT THAT ON TOP OF READING THE LOSS<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> OF MY
HUSBAND AND TRYING TO TAKE CARE OF MY BABY, I WOULD ALSO BE THE VICTIM OF A SCAM. YOU JUST SAW WHAT HAPPENED TO
ME. HOW TRUMP UNIVERSITY CHEATED ME
OUT OF THE MONEY I RECEIVED
AFTER MY HUSBAND'S DEATH. HOW THEY BROKE PROMISES, STOPPED
TAKING MY CALLS, HOW THE WHOLE
THING WAS A LIE. BY CONNING ME OUT OF THE MONEY
THE MILITARY GAVE ME AFTER MY
HUSBAND DIED,

I WAS.
. FRIGHTENED, AND THE TRUTH IS, I
WAS EMBARRASSED. THE WORST PART, I WAS NOT THE
ONLY VICTIM OF DONALD TRUMP. FAR FROM IT. HE CRADLED VULNERABLE PEOPLE LIKE MILITARY WIDOWS, AND THE
UTTERLY.
WBAL TV 11 NEWS ELDERLY.
-- HE MADE NOISE OF DOLLARS OFF
OF PEOPLE LIKE ME. HE CHEATED MORE THAN 5000 STUDENTS. HARD-WORKING MIDDLE-CLASS VOTERS. TEACHERS, POLICE OFFICERS, EVEN
VETERANS. THESE ARE FOLKS JUST LIKE ME WHO DID NOT HAVE A LOT. WHO WERE TOLD THAT IF THEY PAY
FOR DONALD COMES PROGRAMS, THEY
MIGHT BE OF TO MAKE IT BETTER LIVING HERE IS A GUY WHO WAS BORN RICH AND HAS ALL THE MONEY
IN THE WORLD AND THERE'S NOTHING
WRONG WITH THAT.
I SIGNED UP FOR TRUMP UNIVERSITY BECAUSE I THOUGHT I COULD LEARN
FROM BEEN SOME HIM BUT THEN HE DECIDED TO MAKE HIMSELF EVEN
RICHER. BY TEACHING OF WORKING PEOPLE
WHO HAD NOTHING TO SPARE.
WHAT KIND OF MAN DOES THAT? IT IS NOT EASY FOR ME TO GET UP
AND TELL MY STORY. FOR A LONG TIME, I DID NOT TELL ANYBODY. BUT EVEN MY FAMILY OR MY
FRIENDS. BUT I'M HERE BECAUSE AMERICA DESERVES TO KNOW THE TRUTH.
[CHEERING] THIS ELECTION IS NOT ABOUT
DEMOCRAT OR REPUBLICAN.
IT IS ABOUT RIGHT VERSUS WRONG. SOMEONE WHO HELPS ORDINARY PEOPLE NO MATTER WHAT IT TAKES. VERSUS SOMEONE WHO HELPS
HIMSELF, NO MATTER WHO IT HURTS.
[CHEERING] DONALD TRUMP MAKE BIG PROMISES
ABOUT TRUMP UNIVERSITY. I WAS PULLED INTO BELIEVING HIM. NOW HE IS MAKING BIG PROMISES
ABOUT AMERICA. PLEASE, DON'T MAKE THAT SAME
MISTAKE.
