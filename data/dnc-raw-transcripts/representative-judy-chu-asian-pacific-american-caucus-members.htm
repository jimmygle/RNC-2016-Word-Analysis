<strong>Judy Chu</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> REP. CHU: AND I AM PROUD TO BE
THE FIRST CHINESE-AMERICAN WOMAN
EVER ELECTED TO CONGRESS.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] STANDING WITH ME OR MY FELLOW
ASIAN-AMERICAN<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> AND PACIFIC
ISLANDER, OR AAPI MEMBERS OF
CONGRESS. MANY OF THEM TOO OUR
TRAILBLAZERS IN THEIR OWN RIGHT. AND WE ARE ALL PROUD TO SUPPORT HILLARY CLINTON FOR PRESIDENT OF
THE UNITED STATES.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] IT WASN'T TOO LONG AGO THAT IF
YOU SAW AN ASIAN PACIFIC AMERICAN WALKING IN THE U.S. CAPITOL, YOU HAD TO STOP TO DO A
DOUBLE TAKE. BUT HOW THINGS HAVE CHANGED. WE NOW HAVE A RECORD NUMBER OF
THE API MEMBERS OF CONGRESS. MOST IMPORTANTLY, WE ARE ORGANIZING AND MAKING OUR VOICES
HEARD. WE HAVE GONE FROM BEING MARGINALIZED TO BECOMING THE
MARGIN OF VICTORY IN KEY SWING STATES AND DISTRICTS ALL ACROSS OUR NATION. AMERICA NEEDS A PRESIDENT WHO
WILL FIGHT FOR US. SOMEWHAT WHO REJECTS THE HATEFUL RHETORIC TOO OFTEN USED TO DIVIDE US AND BELIEVES THAT AMERICA'S DIVERSITY IS OUR
GREATEST STRENGTH. THAT IS WHY WE STOPPED TO ELECT HILLARY CLINTON AS OUR NEXT
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. WHEN IT COMES TO THE ISSUES MOST
IMPORTANT TO US, HILLARY CLINTON
GETS IT. ON IMMIGRATION REFORM, SHE GETS
IT. SO MANY FAMILIES HAVE BEEN KEPT
APART FOR DECADES BY AN INCREDIBLY LONG FAMILY VISA BACKLOG. HILLARY WILL FIGHT TO CLEAR THAT
BACKLOG SO MANY MILLIONS OF
AMERICAN FAMILIES CAN FINALLY BE REUNITED WITH THEIR LOVED ONES. WE ARE WITH HILLARY BECAUSE SHE IS COMMITTED TO COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM.
[APPLAUSE] ON EDUCATION, SHE GETS IT. MANY OF OUR PARENTS AND GRANDPARENTS SACRIFICED TO COME
TO THE U.S. BECAUSE THEY WANTED
THEIR CHILDREN TO GET A BETTER
EDUCATION AND LIVE THE AMERICAN
DREAM. WE ARE WITH HILLARY BECAUSE SHE
WILL MAKE DEBT-FREE COLORS
AVAILABLE FOR ALL AMERICANS.
ON VOTING RIGHTS, SHE GETS IT. TODAY ALMOST 70% OF AAPI RESULTS
ARE FOREIGN-BORN. ACCESS TO BALANCE IS CRITICAL. WE ARE WITH HILLARY BECAUSE SHE
WILL WORK WITH CONGRESS TO
RESTORE THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT
AND ENSURE FAIR ACCESS TO THE BALLOT BOX.
[APPLAUSE] ON MAKING SURE WE HAVE A DIVERSE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, SHE GETS IT. WE ARE WITH HILLARY BECAUSE SHE WILL APPOINT AN ADMINISTRATION THAT LOOKS LIKE AMERICA.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND ON SAFEGUARDING OUR CIVIL
LIBERTIES, SHE GETS IT. I AM SO PROUD TO HAVE CONGRESSWOMAN DORIS MATSUI AND
CONGRESSMAN MIKE HONDA AS
MEMBERS OF OUR CONGRESS.
-- OF OUR CAUCUS. DURING WORLD WAR II, BOTH DORIS AND MIKE WERE IMPRISONED IN INTERNMENT CAMP FOR NO OTHER
REASON THAN THEIR ETHNICITY. DONALD TRUMP DOESN'T SEEM TO
HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THIS PART OF
OUR HISTORY.
WHEN HILLARY CLINTON, WE KNOW
THE CIVIL AND CONSTITUTIONAL
RIGHTS OF ALL AMERICANS WILL BE PROTECTED.
[APPLAUSE] TONIGHT WE ARE ALSO READING FOR
MARK TAKAI FROM HAWAII, WHO PASSED AWAY LAST WEEK AT THE AGE OF 49 AFTER A HARD-FOUGHT BATTLE WITH PANCREATIC CANCER. MARK TRULY HAD THE ALOHA SPIRIT AND WAS DEEPLY COMMITTED TO ADVANCING THE PRIORITIES OF THE PEOPLE OF HAWAII AND OUR
VETERANS. I WILL NEVER FORGET THE TEARS IN
HIS EYES WHEN HE LEARNED ABOUT
THE CANCER MOONSHOT INITIATIVE.
IT SAVED HIM AND MILLIONS OF
AMERICANS HOPE THAT THEY WILL
FINALLY FIND IT OR FRANCE OR -- FINALLY FIND A CURE FOR CANCER.
WE HAVE TO KEEP HOPING AND
FIGHTING. HILLARY CLINTON IS THE BEST
CHOICE FOR ALL AMERICANS TO MOVE
OUR COUNTRY FORWARD.
OUR CAUCUS MEMBERS REFLECT THE
DIVERSITY OF AMERICA, AND THAT
IS WHY WE ARE PROUD TO STAND WITH HER.
