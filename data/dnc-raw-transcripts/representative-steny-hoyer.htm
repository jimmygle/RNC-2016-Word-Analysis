<strong>Steny Hoyer</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> MR. HOYER: THANK YOU, MARYLAND. GOOD EVENING. FELLOW DEMOCRATS AND FELLOW
AMERICANS. I'M SO PROUD TO BE ADDRESSING YOU HERE IN AMERICA'S FIRST CAPITAL,<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> THE HOME OF INDEPENDENCE HALL, THE LIBERTY BELL AND THE BIRTHPLACE OF OUR CONSTITUTION. I'M PROUD TO SERVE AS THE PARLIAMENTARIAN OF THIS
CONVENTION AND PROUD TO BE HERE WITH THE DELEGATION I JUST
REFERENCED. MY FRIENDS FROM MARYLAND, ALL OF
MY FRIENDS FROM MARYLAND.
[CROWD CHANTING "STENY"] I LOVE YOU, TOO. WE ARE HERE TO NOMINATE HILLARY CLINTON BECAUSE OF HER --
[APPLAUSE] BECAUSE, BECAUSE OF HER ABILITY, HER EXPERIENCE AND HER VISION
FOR OUR COUNTRY. WE ARE ALSO HERE TO SHOW ON
AMERICA WHY DEMOCRATS UP AND DOWN THE TICKET ARE READY TO
LEAD. OVER THE PAST EIGHT YEARS, PRESIDENT OBAMA AND VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN WORKED HARD TO
HELP AMERICANS EMERGE FROM THE
ECONOMIC COLLAPSE USHERED IN BY REPUBLICAN POLICIES. FOR THE FIRST TWO YEARS OF THE
PRESIDENT'S ADMINISTRATION, HE HAD A DEMOCRATIC CONGRESS THAT WAS COMMITTED TO DOING THE JOB AND RESCUING OUR GOVERNMENT. THANK YOU. MILLIONS OF AMERICANS, MILLIONS
OF AMERICANS WORK HARD TIGHTENING THEIR BELTS, THEY PERSEVERED AND NEVER, NEVER,
NEVER GAVE UP. AND WITH THE HELP OF THE
RECOVERY PROGRAM, WE ENACTED,
AMERICA HAS COME BACK. WE KNOW, WE KNOW HOWEVER, UNTIL OPPORTUNITIES COME BACK FOR EVERY AMERICAN, THERE IS A LOT
MORE WORK TO BE DONE. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, LET ME
TELL YOU SINCE THE REPUBLICANS
TOOK CONTROL OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES IN 2011, THEY
HAVE HAD A MESSAGE FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN. HARD-WORKING IMMIGRANTS AND DREAMERS, TO LGBTQ CITIZENS, TO WOMEN DEMANDING EQUAL PAY, TO PARENTS ASKING FOR AFFORDABLE
CHILDCARE AND PAID FAMILY LEAVE, TO MILLIONS WHO HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE TODAY FOR THE FIRST TIME THROUGH THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT --
[APPLAUSE] AND THE REPUBLICAN PARTY HAS SAID TO ALL OF THEM, YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN. BUT WE SAY, YOU'RE NOT ON YOUR OWN.
WE ARE IN THIS TOGETHER. HILLARY CLINTON AND TIM KAINE,
AND DEMOCRATS IN CONGRESS, WILL
ALWAYS BE ON YOUR SIDE.
[APPLAUSE] ON YOUR SIDE BECAUSE WE BELIEVE
THAT WE ARE STRONGER TOGETHER.
[APPLAUSE] AND WE ARE RUNNING TOGETHER. AS THE PREVIOUS SPEAKER POINTED
OUT, TO RENEW FAITH IN GOVERNMENT AND HELP AL LOUR
PEOPLE -- ALL OUR PEOPLE MAKE IT
IN AMERICA. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, AT A SPEECH AT THE REPUBLICAN
CONVENTION LAST WEEK, SPEAKER RYAN SAID THIS ELECTION COMES
DOWN TO A CONTEST OF IDEAS. HE'S RIGHT. BUT, WE HAVE SEEN THE DISASTROUS RESULTS OF REPUBLICAN IDEAS. AND WE HAVE SEEN WHAT THEY CAN
DO TO OUR ECONOMY AND TO OUR
SECURITY. THAT IS WHY, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, ALL OF US, THOSE WHO SUPPORTED SANDERS, THOSE WHO
SUPPORTED CLINTON, THOSE WHO SUPPORTED MY GOVERNOR O'MALLEY, ALL OF US MUST BIND TOGETHER FOR
OUR COUNTRY AND ELECT HILLARY CLINTON PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.
