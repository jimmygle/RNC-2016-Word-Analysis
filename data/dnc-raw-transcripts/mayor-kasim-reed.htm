<strong>Kasim Reed</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> HELLO, GOVERNOR!
[CHEERS] GOOD EVENING.
[CHEERS] AS THE MAYOR OF ATLANTA, THE
CITY THAT BURNED TO THE GROUND
AND ROSE AGAIN FROM THE ASHES,
THE BIRTHPLACE<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> OF DR. MARTIN
LUTHER KING JR. AND THE HOME OF
THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT, AND BECAUSE WE WERE A CITY TOO BUSY
TO HATE, WE ARE NOW AT THE ECONOMIC CENTER OF THE SOUTHEAST. I'M HERE TODAY BECAUSE I BELIEVE
IN OUR FUTURE, I BELIEVE WE HAVE
A RESPONSIBILITY TO ONE ANOTHER, AND TO THE NEXT GENERATION TO
ENSURE THAT OUR OPPORTUNITIES ARE LIMITED ONLY BY OUR IMAGINATION. I SHARE THIS BELIEF WITH HILLARY
CLINTON. THAT OUR ACHIEVEMENTS ARE ONLY
LIMITED BY WHAT WE CAN DREAM AND DO. YOU SEE, ATLANTA IS A CITY OF DREAMERS. BUT WHEN I BECAME MAYOR OF THE
CITY, THE CITY WAS STRUGGLING.
THE WORST RECESSION IN 80 YEARS.
WE WERE DOWN, CRIME WITHOUT, BUT
I LOOKED -- CRIME WAS UP, I
LOOKED AROUND OUR CITY AND I SAW
THE WAY FORWARD WAS TO LEAN ON ONE ANOTHER, TO TURN TO ONE ANOTHER AND TO MAKE AN
UNSHAKABLE AGREEMENT THAT IF A YOUNG PERSON WAS WILLING TO
LEARN, WE WOULD PUT A BOOK IN HER HANDS.
IF A YOUNG MAN WAS WILLING TO WORK, WE WOULD PUT A JOB IN A
PAYCHECK IN HIS HANDS. AND IF YOU ARE WILLING TO STEP UP AND WE WILL MEET YOU HALFWAY
AND TOGETHER WE CAN PUT YOUR
FUTURE BACK IN YOUR HANDS.
PEOPLE WANT TO DREAM AGAIN.
[CHEERS] WE TURNED OUR CITY AROUND.
AT THE SAME TIME, PRESIDENT
BARACK OBAMA AND VICE PRESIDENT
JOE BIDEN WERE TURNING AMERICA
AROUND. TODAY, WE ARE STRONGER, AND WE
WILL GROW STRONGER STILL, WHEN
PRESIDENT HILLARY CLINTON BUILDS AN ECONOMY THAT WORKS FOR EVERYONE.
[APPLAUSE] MAYOR REED: MY FELLOW DEMOCRATS,
TONIGHT, WE CHOOSE DIVERSITY
OVER DIVISION.
WE CHOOSE A STEADY HANDED
COMMANDER IN CHIEF OVER A LOOSE
CANNON. WE CHOOSE A LEADER WHO WOULD
RATHER BE IN THE TRENCHES,
SECURING HEALTH CARE FOR 8 MILLION CHILDREN, THEN IN A
SWEET PUTTING HIS NAME ON A
TOWER THAT HE PROBABLY DOESN'T
OWN. WE CHOOSE SOMETHING DIFFERENT
TONIGHT.
[APPLAUSE] MAYOR REED: I BELIEVE AMERICANS
ARE READY TO GET TO WORK.
TO MAKE THE POSSIBLE, REAL. HILLARY CLINTON IS THE LEADER TO
TAKE US THERE. PRESIDENT HARRY TRUMAN ONCE SAID, "THERE ARE A SMALL NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN AMERICA WHO HAVE THE POWER, AND THE PRESTIGE, AND
THE CONNECTIONS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEIR INTERESTS ARE LOOKED AFTER." BUT HE SAID, "FOR
EVERYBODY ELSE, THERE IS THE
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES."
AND THAT IS WHY WE NEED HILLARY
CLINTON.
[APPLAUSE] MAYOR REED: MORE THAN 60 YEARS LATER, HIS STATEMENT HOLDS TRUE
TONIGHT. AND TONIGHT, WE HAVE SOMEONE WHO
WILL LOOK OUT FOR ALL AMERICANS,
AND WHO WILL DO SO EVERY DAY OF HER PRESIDENCY, WITH ALL OF HER
HEART.
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WE HAVE
OUR CHAMPION, HILLARY CLINTON.
LET ME HEAR YOU.
[APPLAUSE] MAYOR REED: AND NOW, I AM HONORED TO INTRODUCE SOMEONE WHO HAS BEEN A FRIEND AND MENTOR TO
ME DURING MY TIME AS MAYOR. MICHAEL BLOOMBERG HAS ARTICULATED AND OPTIMISTIC PERFORMANCE, A UNIVERSAL VISION THAT HAS BUILT NEW YORK CITY AND HAS ALSO HELPED OTHER CITIES
AROUND THE WORLD.
THANKS TO HIS PERFECT -- HIS PHILANTHROPY, HE HAS DONE SO MUCH.
PLEASE JOIN ME IN WELCOMING A MAN WHOSE COMMITMENT TO AMERICA TRANSCENDS POLITICS. THE THREE-TIME MAYOR OF THE CITY
OF NEW YORK, MICHAEL BLOOMBERG.
[APPLAUSE]
