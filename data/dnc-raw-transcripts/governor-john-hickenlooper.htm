<strong>Unidentified Speaker</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> 30 YEARS AGO, ALMOST TO THE DAY I LOST MY JOB. WHETHER IT IS BEING LAID OFF OR
DOWNSIZED WERE FIRED, IT IS NOT FUNNY AND NOT A REALITY SHOW PUNCHLINE<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> WHAT HAPPENS TO YOU. IT WAS NOT JUST ME, A HOLD GENERATION LOST THEIR CAREERS IN THE RECESSION. IT IS HARD WHEN YOU FEEL THAT
YOU ARE NOT WANTED ANYMORE. AFTER MANY MONTHS, LOOKING FOR
WORK WAS HARDLY -- DIFFICULT. ANYBODY I DECIDED TO START THE
FIRST GROUP HUG IN COLORADO.
[CHEERS] WE HAD NO MONEY. EVEN MY OWN MOTHER WOULD NOT INVEST. FINALLY, IF YOU MONTHS LATER, WE
OPENED AN ABANDONED WAREHOUSE DICTIONARY -- DISTRICT. WE HAD 34, AND LOVE FROM THE
CITY, A LOAN FROM THE SCA.
WE OPENED. SLOWLY BUT SURELY, WE GREW AND EXPANDED. I NEVER HOSTED A REALITY TV SHOW, THAT I KNOW THAT THE TRUE
MARK OF A SUCCESSFUL BUSINESSMAN
IF NOT THE NUMBER OF TIMES YOU
SAY YOU'RE FIRED, IT IS THE
NUMBER OF TIMES YOU SAY YOU'RE HIRED.
[CHEERS] THAT IS RIGHT. ON THE BUSINESS GUY, UNLIKE TRUMP, MY BUSINESS TO BACK UP BITE DROPPED -- BUSINESS DID NOT GO BANKRUPT SIX TIMES. SUCCESS IS SWEETER WHEN IT IS
SHARED. THAT IS JUST AS TRUE IN BUSINESS
AS IT IS IN LIFE. AND ON NEIGHBORHOOD, THERE WERE
A HANDFUL OF OTHER ENTREPRENEURS TRY TO DEVELOP BUSINESSES.
TOGETHER WE WORKED WITH THE
DOWNTOWN DENVER PARTNERSHIP TO
CREATE A SENSE OF PLACE. MORE ENTREPRENEURS ARRIVED HIS
ARMOR BUSINESSES AND THE
NEIGHBORHOODS TOOK OFF.
SO DID DENVER. IT WAS MY BUDDY AND I THAT TOOK THE REST, BUT AS HILLARY CLINTON
SAID, IT TAKES A VILLAGE. BUSINESSES, GOVERNMENT,
NONPROFITS, WORKING TOGETHER TO
CREATE OPPORTUNITY. SHE UNDERSTANDS THAT EVEN IN COLORADO, LAND OF RUGGED INDIVIDUALISM, OUR ECONOMY IS STRONGER TOGETHER. AS A SMALL BUSINESSMAN, THE
MERIT OF NERD AND NOW GOVERNOR,
-- MAYOR OF DENVER, AND NOW
GOVERNOR, I SEE A PARTNERSHIPS DRIVE ECONOMIES.
DENVER IS THE FASTEST-GROWING BIG CITY IN AMERICA AND COLORADO HAS A SECOND STRONGEST ECONOMY IN THE COUNTRY.
[CHEERS] COMPARE THAT TO DONALD TRUMP TRICKLE DOWN ECONOMICS WHERE HE DOES NOT PAY HIS BILLS IN SMALL BUSINESSES GO OUT OF BUSINESS. I SPENT SOME TIME WITH GOING AND
I CAN TELL YOU FROM A SMALL BUSINESS PERSPECTIVE, HE GETS IT. PEOPLE FEEL THAT THEY ARE NOT
WANTED ANYMORE. I REMEMBER THAT FEELING. MANY OF THE SKILLS THAT WOULD
HAVE BEEN TICKETS TO THE MIDDLE
CLASS ARE NO LONGER NEEDED.
THAT IS WHY WE DISCUSS THAT ONLY
THE IMPORTANCE OF EDUCATION TRAINING, BUT STREAMLINING
REGULATION, EXPANDING ACCESS TO LOANS, INCENTIVIZING INNOVATION AND HOW TO SUPPORT THE TRANSPORTATION -- TRANSFORMATION
OF NEW IDEAS AND JOB.
I TOLD THEM ABOUT COLORADO'S
INITIATIVES THAT ALLOW KIDS TO GO TO WORK AND TAKE CLASSES TO
BE MORE SUCCESSFUL IN THEIR
JOBS. HILLARY CLINTON UNDERSTANDS IN
THESE ECONOMIC TIMES, PARTNERSHIP CAN LEAD TO
OPPORTUNITY. WHICH IS WHY SHE WANTS TO OFFER TAX INCENTIVES TO COMPANIES THAT OFFER APPRENTICESHIPS IN
UNDERSERVED AREAS. SHE'S GOING TO MAKE THE LARGEST SINGLE INVESTMENT AND JOBS SINCE
WORLD WAR II.
[CHEERS] AND SHE WILL CUT RED TAPE AND TAXES SO IT IS EASIER TO START
AND GROW A SMALL BUSINESS. HILLARY CLINTON IS GOING TO WORK
FOR THE YOUNG ENTREPRENEUR WHO WANT TO START A GROUP HUG OR START A STARTUP OR CREATE A
BUSINESS JUST LIKE HER DAD. ALL THOSE YEARS AGO IN CHICAGO. TONIGHT, HILLARY CLINTON ACCEPTS THE NOMINATION FOR PRESIDENT OF
THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.
[CHEERS] TOMORROW, WE ARE GOING TO GET
DATABASES. I SAY TO YOU, PUT DOWN YOUR POKEMON GO FOR JUST A SECOND AND GO TO HILLARY CLINTON.COM. IF YOU SIGN UP BEFORE MIDNIGHT, YOU CAN HAVE A CHANCE TO WIN OPPORTUNITY TO BE WITH HER ON
THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL. WE ALL HAVE A JOB TO DO. ELECTING HILLY COUNTRY OF LET'S GO TO WORK.
[CHEERS] GOD BLESS YOU.
[CHEERS]
