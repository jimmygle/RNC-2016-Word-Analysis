<strong>Maxine Waters</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> REP. WATERS: HELLO DEMOCRATS. I AM MAXINE WATERS AND I AM A PROUD DEMOCRAT FROM THE
PROGRESSIVE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THE PRIMARY<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> SEASON HAS ENDED, AND WE HAVE SO MUCH TO BE PROUD
OF. AS A MEMBER OF THE PLATFORM
COMMITTEE, I HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH GIVING BERNIE SANDERS CREDIT FOR CONTRIBUTING TO OUR
HISTORIC PROGRESSIVE PLATFORM.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] AND I AM THRILLED TO A KNOWLEDGE SECRETARY HILLARY CLINTON'S WORK
TO UNITE AND STRENGTHEN OUR
DEMOCRATIC PARTY.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] SO TOMORROW NIGHT, HILLARY CLINTON WILL ACCEPT THE PARTY NOMINATION.
AND WE MUST LEAVE THIS CONVENTION ENERGIZED, UNITED, AND COMMITTED TO WINNING IN
NOVEMBER.
[APPLAUSE] AMERICA, WE HAVE A WINNER IN WAITING. THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I AM SO PROUD TO SUPPORT A WOMAN WHO HAS THE SKILLS TO MEET WITH WORLD LEADERS, CAME AND QUEENS,
AND WHO COMMANDS RESPECT FROM OUR FRIENDS AND OUR FOES ALIKE.
I AM ELATED TO HAVE A CANDIDATE
WHO REALLY UNDERSTANDS DIPLOMACY, GLOBAL SECURITY, AND
THE IMPORTANCE OF CLIMATE
PROTECTION. I AM SO THANKFUL WE HAVE HILLARY CLINTON, WHOSE LIFE OF PUBLIC
SERVICE IS NOT MYTHICAL, BUT REAL AND PROFOUND. HILLARY CLINTON WILL HAVE THE TRUST OF OUR DISABLED AMERICANS. SHE WILL NEVER MOCK OR DISRESPECT THEM. SHE WILL WORK TO IMPROVE THEIR
LIVES. AND SHE WILL NOT ALLOW OUR
VETERANS TO BE PATRONIZED OR FORGOTTEN. I KNOW HILLARY CLINTON WILL
CREATE A PLACE AT THE TABLE FOR
ALL. AFRICAN-AMERICANS, LATINOS,
AGENTS, THE LGBT COMMUNITY, NATIVE AMERICANS, JEWS, MUSLIMS, BAPTISTS, PENTECOSTALS -- EVERYONE WILL BE WELCOMED IN
HILLARY CLINTON'S WHITE HOUSE. NOW YOU KNOW THE NRA HAS INTIMIDATED A LOT OF MEMBERS OF
CONGRESS. BUT HILLARY CLINTON IS NOT
INTIMIDATED BY THE NRA.
GUN VIOLENCE MUST STOP IN THIS
COUNTRY. SHE WILL NOT ROLL WITH FEAR AND
PREDICTIONS OF FAILURE. AND SHE WILL WORK TO SUPPORT OUR BELIEFS, SHE WILL ALSO SUPPORT
FAIR AND JUST POLICE POLICY. THE LOST LIVES OF UNARMED
CITIZENS MUST STOP. BLACK LIVES MATTER.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] OH YES, WOMEN OF AMERICA, WOMEN
OF THE WORLD, WE ARE GOING TO BE TREATED WITH DIGNITY AND
RESPECT. WE WILL NOT BE JUDGED BY OUR APPEARANCE OR OUR SIZE OR OUR ACCENT. WE WILL NOT BE DENIED FREEDOM OF
CHOICE. WE WILL DEMONSTRATE OUR TALENTS
AND WE WILL PROSPER. HILLARY'S EXPERIENCE AS THE FIRST LADY, AS THE U.S. SENATOR, AS THE BEST SECRETARY OF STATE
WE EVER HAD, UNIQUELY QUALIFIES HER TO BE THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF
THE UNITED STATES. THANK YOU.
