<strong>Cameron McLay</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> GREETINGS, GREETINGS. ALL ACROSS THIS COUNTRY, MY
BROTHERS AND SISTERS IN BLUE ARE DOING WHAT I ARGUE IS
POTENTIALLY THE HARDEST TO JOB
IN THIS NATION<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> TODAY. AT THE START OF EVERY SHIFT, THEY GO TO WORK NEVER KNOWING FOR SURE WHAT DANGERS THEY MIGHT
FACE.
AND THERE IS A CRISIS, ESPECIALLY IN THE EYES OF MANY
OF THE COMMUNITIES WE SERVE, PARTICULARLY WITH OUR
COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. THERE IS A CRISIS OF TRUST IN THE POLICE AND THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. IRONICALLY, CRIME RATES HAVE BEEN FALLING FOR DECADES THAT
RESEARCH SHOWS THE PUBLIC TRUST IS ERODING AND FAR TOO MANY
PLACES. DR. MARTIN LUTHER KING SAID IT
BEAUTIFULLY "TRUE PEACE IS NOT THE ABSENCE OF TENSION, IT IS
THE PRESENCE OF JUSTICE."
[APPLAUSE] IRONICALLY, OUR COMMUNITIES ARE
ARGUABLY SAFER THAN EVER BEFORE. HOWEVER, LESS CRIME IN YOUR
NEIGHBORHOOD IS AT BEST A HOLLOW
VICTORY. THE CONTROVERSIAL
OFFICER-INVOLVED SHOOTING'S THAT
HAVE OCCURRED SINCE FERGUSON
HAVE CREATED A LEVEL OF TENSION
BETWEEN POLICE IN OUR
COMMUNITIES WHILE AT THE SAME
TIME, THERE HAS BEEN A GREAT
DEAL OF WORK GOING ON TO IMPROVE
THOSE RELATIONSHIPS. IN PITTSBURGH, WE ARE DOING THIS IMPORTANT WORK.
WE RECOGNIZE OUR INTERDEPENDENCY AND WE ARE WORKING CLOSELY
TOGETHER TO REDUCE THE VIOLENCE AND MAKE SURE THAT OUR RESIDENTS FEEL BOTH SAFE AND RESPECTED.
[APPLAUSE] BUT THINGS ARE FRAGILE. TWO CONTROVERSIAL POLICE SHOOTINGS IN TWO CONSECUTIVE
DAYS IN MINNESOTA AND LOUISIANA LEFT MANY OUTRAGE. THE ASSASSINATION OF EIGHT POLICE OFFICERS IN 10 DAYS HAVE
LEFT MANY OF US IN THE
LAW-ENFORCEMENT COMMUNITY UNDER
SIEGE. BOTH OF THESE CONCERNS ARE VERY,
VERY REAL. WITHOUT QUESTION, THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM HAS HAD AN IMPACT
ON OUR COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. AND YET SOCIETY IS ASKING AT THE SAME TIME FAR MORE OF OUR POLICE OFFICERS THAN EVER BEFORE. DECLINING ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES
, DISINVESTMENT IN MENTAL HEALTH, AND THE ABSENCE OF EFFECTIVE DRUG TREATMENT OPTIONS FOR THOSE ADDICTED. AS A POLICE OFFICER WHO HAS SERVED MORE THAN 30 YEARS, LET ME SAY THIS -- WE CAN RESPECT AND SUPPORT OUR POLICE OFFICERS
WHILE AT THE SAME TIME PUSHING
FOR THESE IMPORTANT CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORMS.
[APPLAUSE] WE CAN DO BOTH AND WE WILL DO BOTH. I PROMISE YOU THERE ARE MANY,
MANY MORE POLICE LEADERS JUST LIKE ME WHO ARE FULLY CONVINCED
AND FULLY COMMITTED THAT WE NEED TO IMPROVE BUT WE CANNOT SUCCEED
UNLESS WE COME TOGETHER WITH THE
COMMUNITIES WE SERVE. WE MUST EACH AS HUMAN BEINGS FIGHT OUR NATURAL TENDENCY TO
HIDE INSIDE OUR OWN NARROW WORK
OF YOU.
INSTEAD, WE MUST SEEK COMMON
GROUND WITH THE OBJECTIVE OF
CREATING AN AMERICA THAT TRULY
IS AND TRULY PROVIDES A SOURCE
OF LIBERTY AND JUSTICE FOR ALL. I THANK YOU.
[APPLAUSE]</span><span class='hidden-full-transcript-ellipses'>...</span></p><a href='#' class='hidden-full-transcript-link'><i class='icon-chevron-down'></i> <span class='link-show-full-text'>Show Full Text</span><i class='icon-chevron-up'></i> <span class='link-show-less-text'>Show Less Text</span></a>
