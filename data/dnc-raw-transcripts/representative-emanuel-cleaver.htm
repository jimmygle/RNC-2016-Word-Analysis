<p class='short_transcript'> >> THANK YOU. THANK YOU. LET ME BEGIN BY ISSUING A HEARTFELT INVITATION TO OUR REPUBLICAN FRIENDS. IF YOUR PARTY IS NO LONGER BE COMING TO YOU THEN YOU<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> SHOULD BE
COMING TO US.
NEXT YEAR'S BILLI HAVE KNOWN HILLARY CLINTON FOR
MORE THAN 25 YEARS, AND LET ME TELL YOU, SHE WON'T LET YOU
DOWN. IN SPITE OF WHAT YOU HEARD LAST WEEK, IT IS NOT MIDNIGHT IN
AMERICA. MIDNIGHT CAN THE COLD AND CRIPPLING, AND PRESIDENT OBAMA DID NOT LEAVE US IN THE COLD, AND WE ARE CERTAINLY NOT
CRIPPLING. IN REALITY, THE SUN HAS BARELY RISEN OVER THE VASTNESS OF THESE
UNITED STATES.
IT IS DAWN IN AMERICA, AND WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF BECOMING. YES, IF YOU WANT TO SAY WHAT THE BIBLE SAYS, WE ARE NOT YET WHAT
WE SHALL BECOME. AT A TIME WHEN THE CITIZENS OF THIS AMAZING COUNTRY ARE SPREADING OVER A MULTITUDE OF
FEARS AND HEARTACHES, WE NEED A
LEADER WHO WILL BECOME A
TRAFFICKER AND OPTIMISM AND A
PIECE PEDDLER. HILLARY WILL BUILD THE FUTURE WE
CAN ALL BE PART OF AND PROUD OF. THERE'S AN OLD STORY ABOUT
ANDREW JACKSON AS A CHILD.
HE LOOKS LIKE ANYTHING BUT A
FUTURE GENERAL OR PRESIDENT. IN FACT, ONE OF HIS BOYHOOD
FRIENDS SAYS THAT JIM BROWN, WHO
LIVED IN THE SAME AREA, COULD THROW INJURED TO THE GROUND THREE TIMES OUT OF FOUR IN WRESTLING MATCHES. A WRITER WOULD LATER ASK, WHY
WERE THERE FOUR MATCHES? SURELY IF A PERSON IS THROWN
THREE TIMES, THEY ARE ALL OVER.
HE SAYS, HE WOULD THROW OLD ANDY, BUT HE WOULD GET RIGHT UP, BECAUSE ANDY JUST WOULDN'T STAY THROWED. HE WITHIN STATE WANTED TO STAY THROWED. THE FIRST PRESIDENT WHO WOULDN'T STAY THROWED WAS A BABY WHO GREW
IN BETHLEHEM. THEY PUT HIM IN A GRAVE, AND
THREE DAYS LATER, THE WORLD NEW
HE WOULDN'T STAY THROWED. HERE'S A WARNING FOR THOSE WHO
MIGHT BE TEMPTED TO SPEND THE
NEXT FOUR YEARS TRYING TO KNOCK
HILLARY CLINTON DOWN -- YOU
BETTER GET READY FOR A WOMAN WHO
WON'T STAY THROWED.</span><span class='hidden-full-transcript-ellipses'>...</span></p><a href='#' class='hidden-full-transcript-link'><i class='icon-chevron-down'></i> <span class='link-show-full-text'>Show Full Text</span><i class='icon-chevron-up'></i> <span class='link-show-less-text'>Show Less Text</span></a>
