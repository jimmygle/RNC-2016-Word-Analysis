<strong>Shirley Franklin</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> MS. FRANKLIN: I AM PROUD TO
PRESENT THE PLATFORM COMMITTEE
REPORT. AS A DEMOCRAT, I AM PRIVILEGED
TO BE HERE AT THIS MOMENTUS
OCCASION, HONORING OUR PARTY'S<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> LEGACY AND STANDING ON THE
SHOULDERS OF GIANTS. I CANNOT HELP BUT BE REMINDED OF BARBARA JORDAN, THE FIRST BLACK WOMAN TO GIVE A KEYNOTE ADDRESS
AT THE DEMOCRATIC CONVENTION. IN 1996, SHE ASKED, ARE WE TO BE ONE PEOPLE BOUND TOGETHER BY COMMON SPIRIT, SHARING IN COMMON ENDEAVORS, OR WILL WE BECOME A DIVIDED NATION? I BELIEVE WE ARE FACED WITH THE SAME QUESTIONS TODAY. AND I BELIEVE WE AND HILLARY CLINTON HAVE THE ANSWERS. THREE WEEKS AGO, 187 MEMBERS HEARD TESTIMONY FROM 144
WITNESSES. WE DELIBERATED FOR HOURS. WE TOOK COMMENTS FROM EXPERTS, ADVOCATES, ELECTED OFFICIALS, AND NEIGHBORS, COWORKERS, AND IN
THE MOST OPEN AND TRANSPARENT PROCESS IN OUR PARTY'S HISTORY,
WE DRAFTED THE MOST PROGRESSIVE
PLATFORM EVER. IT IS A BOLD VISION FOR WORKING FAMILIES -- SOCIAL JUSTICE AND
THE CONTINUED PROSPERITY AND
SECURITY OF OUR COUNTRY. AND IT IS REFLECTIVE OF OUR
VALUES AS DEMOCRATS, THE PARTY OF INCLUSION. WE KNOW THAT THE COMMON ENDEAVOR THAT BARBARA JORDAN CALLED FOR
40 YEARS AGO IS JUST AS POWERFUL AND PROFOUND TODAY. AND WE KNOW THAT OUR PARTY, OUR COUNTRY IS STRONGER TOGETHER.
THANK YOU.</span><span class='hidden-full-transcript-ellipses'>...</span></p><a href='#' class='hidden-full-transcript-link'><i class='icon-chevron-down'></i> <span class='link-show-full-text'>Show Full Text</span><i class='icon-chevron-up'></i> <span class='link-show-less-text'>Show Less Text</span></a>

ADOPT<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> THESE HARD-FIVE AGREEMENTS, I AM -- HARD-THOUGHT AGREEMENTS, I AM PROUD TO PUT FORTH THE MOST AMBITIOUS
PLATFORM THAT DEMOCRATIC PARTY
HAS EVER OFFERED. DEMOCRATS OF EVERY STRIPE CAME TOGETHER TO CREATE THIS BOLD PLAN FOR PROGRESS AND MAKE NO
MISTAKE, IT IS A WIN FOR MIDDLE-CLASS FAMILIES AND ALL
THOSE TRYING TO GET THERE.
IT AND ASK THE CIRCLE INVESTMENTS IN INFRASTRUCTURE
THAT WILL MAKE OUR COUNTRY MORE
COMPETITIVE IN THE 21ST CENTURY. IT HAS A DECLARATION TO INCREASE THE MINIMUM WAGE TO AT LEAST $15 AN HOUR. IT HAS SUPPORT FOR THE PUBLIC SERVICES, THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS,
AND THE PUBLIC WORKERS WHO ARE
THE BACKBONE OF OUR COUNTRY AND
KEEP OUR NEIGHBORHOODS STRONG,
SAFE, AND THRIVING. AND IT HAS PROGRESSIVE AND HIGH
STANDARDS ON TRADE TO PROTECT AMERICAN WORKERS. AND IT COMETH US TO TAKE -- AND IT COMMITS US TO TAKE FORCEFULLY THE CHALLENGES OF SYSTEMIC RACISM IN AMERICA. THIS PLATFORM FIGHTS FOR SOCIAL JUSTICE, FOR EQUAL PAY AND HIGHER PAY, FOR SAFE AND SECURE RETIREMENT, AND FOR THE RIGHT TO
ORGANIZE LABOR UNIONS. TO AMERICANS WHO ARE HAVING IT
ROUGH TRUNK TO MAKE ENDS MEET,
TO THOSE WHO HAVE SEEN HEARTBREAKING VIOLENCE, TO THOSE
WHO THINK THE AMERICAN DREAM IS
SLIPPING OUT OF REACH OR THAT CLIMATE CHANGE IS HOPELESSLY IRREVERSIBLE, WE HAVE DONE OUR
BEST TO PAVE A HOPEFUL PATH FORWARD. OUR PLATFORM IS NOT A BUNCH OF SLOGANS. WE OFFER PLANS, NOT EMPTY PROMISES, AND WE NEED LEADERS
CAPABLE OF DELIVERING THOSE PLANS, AND THAT IS EXACTLY WHO
WE ARE NOMINATING, HILLARY CLINTON AND TIM KAINE. WHO AGREE AND WILL CARRY OUT OUR VISIONS. THE REPUBLICAN PLATFORM --

<strong>Paul Booth</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> MR. BOOTH: THE REPUBLICAN PLATFORM WOULD NOT MAKE AMERICA GREAT. LEGALIZING DISCRIMINATION, CUTTING HOLES IN THE SAFETY THAT, AUSTERITY FOR YOU AND ME
WHILE<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> THE CORPORATE ELITES AND MILLIONAIRES GET SPECIAL
PRIVILEGES, AND MORE DEREGULATION, MORE PRIVATIZATION. THAT WOULD NOT MAKE AMERICA
GREAT. AND NEITHER WILL THE GRIDLOCK WE
HAVE BEEN LIVING WITH. AMERICANS NEED A BETTER OPTION, AND THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT THIS BOLD AGENDA REPRESENTS. BUT WORDS ALONE ARE NOT ENOUGH. THIS PLATFORM NEEDS A MANDATE
FROM THE VOTERS OF AMERICA, AND THAT DEMANDS THAT WE COME TOGETHER AND WORK TOGETHER AND ORGANIZE TOGETHER AND MOBILIZE TOGETHER ANYWHERE AND EVERYWHERE TO WIN THIS NOVEMBER AND BEYOND. BROTHERS AND SISTERS, NONE OF
THE VISIONARY PROPOSALS THAT WE
HAVE COMMITTED TO, THE POLICIES
THAT BROUGHT MILLIONS OF US INTO ACTIVIST ENGAGEMENT IN THE PRIMARIES, NONE CAN BE ACHIEVED WITHOUT THAT MANDATE FROM THE VOTER. LET'S FACE IT, AMERICANS ARE
SKEPTICAL. THEY HAVE SEEN REPUBLICAN PARTNERSHIP BLOCKING PEOPLE FROM
MEDICAID. THEY HAVE EVEN SHUT DOWN THE GOVERNMENT, SO THEY ASK, CAN WE
DELIVER FOR WORKING MEN AND WOMEN? OUR ANSWER,OUR ANSWER, YES, WE CAN. WE CAN BE PROUD OF WHAT WE HAD
WRITTEN TOGETHER.
WE SHOULD BE. THE SOLUTIONS AMERICAN WANT AND NEED ARE IN THIS PLATFORM. SO LET'S RATIFY IT TOGETHER. LET'S TAKE IT OUT ON THE ROAD TO TOGETHER, AND WITH THESE
PROGRESSIVE PRINCIPLES GUIDING
US, LET'S LET DEMOCRATS FROM THE WHITE HOUSE TO THE 50 STATE HOUSES TOGETHER.

<strong>Benjamin Jealous</strong>

TO TAKE BACK THE SENATE, I LEFT LOCAL -- ELECT CHANGEMAKERS, DEFEAT STRUMP, AND MAKE
HILLARY CLINTON THE PRESIDENT OF
THE UNITED STATE. AND I AM PROUD -- THIS. FORM,
THE MOST PROGRESSIVE PLATFORM IN
THE HISTORY OF OUR PARTY. IT EMPOWERS US ALL TO PULL TOGETHER AND WIN THE BALLOT BOX
AND BEYOND. YOU SEE, I HAIL FROM THE GREAT STATE OF MARYLAND, WHERE WE ARE
-- WHERE DEMOCRATS HAVE SHOWN WHEN WE ALL COME TOGETHER AS ONE, WE WIN MORE, BIGGER VICTORIES AFTER. FOUR YEARS AGO, WHEN A REACTIONARY REPUBLICAN WERE EVERYBODY'S RIGHTS EVERYWHERE, ALL AT ONCE, WE IN MARYLAND ADOPTED THE MOTTO OF THE THREE MUSKETEERS -- ALL FOR ONE AND
ONE FOR ALL. IN THE YEAR THAT FOLLOWED, WE
ABOLISHED THE DEATH PENALTY,
PAST MARRIAGE EQUALITY, DECRIMINALIZED THE PROTECTION OF MARIJUANA, PAST THE DREAM ACT -- PASSED THE DREAM ACT AND PASSED
SENSIBLE GUN SAFETY REFORM. AND IT IS IN THAT SAME SPIRIT
THAT WE PRESENT THIS PLATFORM
TONIGHT AND SAY TO THE STUDENTS AND GRADUATES WHO ARE DROWNING IN DEBT, JOIN US AT THE BALLOT
BOX THIS FALL AND TOGETHER WE WILL MAKE COLLEGE RADICALLY MORE
AFFORDABLE. TO COMMUNITIES DEVASTATED BY
MASS INCARCERATION AND MURDER, JOIN US AT THE BALLOT BOX AND
TOGETHER WE WILL SHIFT OUR NATION'S PRIORITIES AWAY FROM
THE FAILED WAR ON DRUGS AND TOWARDS REHABILITATION AND A
REINCORPORATION OF MEN AND WOMEN
RETURNING FROM PRISON INTO OUR
ECONOMY. AND PUBLIC SAFETY STRATEGY THAT
ACTUALLY MAKES US SAFER. TO THE HARD-WORKING PARENTS WHO
BEAR THAT SPECIAL PAIN THAT
COMES WHEN YOU REALIZE YOUR
FAMILY JUST CANNOT SURVIVE ON
$7.25, WE SAY JOIN US AT THE
BALLOT BOX AND WE WILL WIN THE FIGHT FOR $15 AND RAISE THE MINIMUM WAGE, FROM COAST TO COAST, TO $15 PER HOUR. AND TO RESIDENTS OF WORLD COMMUNITIES AND URBAN AREAS RAVAGED BY THE POISONING OF THEIR WELLS AND THE WATER SUPPLY, WE SAY JOIN US AT THE BALLOT BOX AND WE WILL ENSURE
THAT YOUR VOICE IS HEARD AND YOUR WATER IS MADE CLEAN AND OUR NATION SHIFTS AWAY FROM GAS AND COAL AND TOWARD WIND AND SOLAR. AND TO PEOPLE OF GOOD CONSCIENCE EVERYWHERE WHO ARE TIRED OF
BEING SCAPEGOATED AND KILLED BECAUSE OF RACISM, TRANS PHOBIA,
HOMOPHOBIA, AND XENOPHOBIA WE SAY JOIN US AT THE BALLOT BOX
AND TOGETHER WE WILL MOVE AMERICA FORWARD TO BECOME THE
MOST PERFECT EXAMPLE OF THE UNITY AND DIGNITY OF THE HUMAN FAMILY THAT THE WORLD HAS EVER
SEEN. AND TO ALL AMERICANS, WE SAY WE ARE THE PARTY OF FDR, JFK, MLK, SHIRLEY CHISHOLM, BARBARA MIKULSKI, BARACK OBAMA, AND HILLARY CLINTON. WE BROKE THE GENDER BARRIER AT THE SENATE AND THE COLOR BARRIER
AT THE WHITE HOUSE. JOIN US AT THE BALLOT BOX AND WE
WILL ELECT HILLARY CLINTON PRESIDENT OF THESE UNITED STATES, DEFEAT DONALD TRUMP, AND
BUILD A BETTER AMERICA FOR ALL
OUR DOLLARS AND SON.
