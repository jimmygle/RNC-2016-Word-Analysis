<strong>Elizabeth Banks</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> IT'S CERTAINLY AN INCONVENIENCE FOR A BUSINESS.
(music)
>> I DON'T USUALLY SAY THIS
ABOUT DONALD TRUMP, BUT THAT WAS OVER THE TOP. I CONFIRMED IT JUST<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> NOW. CITRON -- I JUST BOUGHT THAT FOG
MACHINE ON EBAY FOR $30. I DON'T FEEL GOOD ABOUT IT, I
DON'T. WHO IS PUMPED UP?
[CHEERS] WHO IS EXCITED TO POUND A DOZEN CHEESESTEAKS WITH ME AFTER THIS?
[CHEERS] LET'S TRY THAT AGAIN. WHO IS READY TO ELECT HILLARY
CLINTON THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF
THE UNITED STATES?
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] ME TOO. I'M ELIZABETH BANKS. SOME OF YOU KNOW ME FROM THE
HUNGER GAMES IN WHICH I PLAY ETSIE TRINKET, A CRUEL, OUT OF
TOUCH REALITY TV STAR WHO WEARS INSANE WAKES WHILE LIVING IN A
VIOLENT DYSTOPIA. WHEN I WENT TO CLEVELAND LAST
WEEK I WAS LIKE HEY, THAT'S MY
ACT.
[APPLAUSE] PART OF ME REALLY LIKES BEING A
PEER AND JOKING AROUND BUT THE
OTHER PART OF ME KNOWS THIS
ELECTION IS TOO IMPORTANT FOR JOKES BECAUSE WHEN I THINK ABOUT
WHAT THIS ELECTION MEANS FOR
AMERICA I INC. ABOUT MY FAMILY. MY FATHER, THE VIETNAM VET,
MAYBE I CAN AND THIRD SHIFTS IN PITTSFIELD, MASSACHUSETTS. MY MOTHER WORKED AT THE LIBRARY AND LOCAL BANK AND THEY WORKED HARD.
THEY STRUGGLED BECAUSE LIKE
MILLIONS OF AMERICAN PARENTS, THEY WANTED TO GIVE THEIR KIDS,
FOUR OF US, A GOOD LIFE WITH
BOUNDLESS OPPORTUNITIES. AND IT IS BECAUSE OF WHAT
DEMOCRATS BUILT, GOOD PUBLIC SCHOOLS, AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE,
HELP IN THE HARDEST TIMES, THAT THEY WERE ABLE TO DO THAT.
THEIR DREAMS TOOK ME HERE TO
PHILADELPHIA, REALLY. THROUGH SCHOLARSHIPS AND FINANCIAL AID, I WORKED MY WAY TO THE UNIVERSITY OF
PENNSYLVANIA. I GOT A WORLD-CLASS EDUCATION
AND I MET MY WONDERFUL HUSBAND AND PARTNER, MAX.
I WILL NEVER FORGET THAT DAY IN
1992 WHEN WE WENT ON A BIG, ROMANTIC DATE, A RALLY FOR BILL
CLINTON. AND IT WAS THERE THAT I LEARNED SOMETHING REALLY IMPORTANT ABOUT
SHOW BUSINESS. THE HEADLINER SHOULD ALWAYS
WATCH OUT FOR SOMEONE STEALING
THE SHOW. HILLARY CLINTON ROCKED MY WORLD. A SMART, COMMITTED, SUCCESSFUL WOMEN AND NOT FOR HER OWN BENEFIT BUT A FIGHTER FOR WOMEN AND CHILDREN, COPS AND FIRST RESPONDERS, HEALTH CARE AND
GIRLS AROUND THE WORLD, THAT IS
HILLARY CLINTON AND THAT IS WHAT
TONIGHT IS ALL ABOUT, THE FIGHTS
OF HER LIFE. DID YOU KNOW THAT WHEN HILLARY CLINTON GRADUATED LAW SCHOOL, SHE DIDN'T JUST SELL OUT AND
WORK FOR SOME FANCY LAW FIRM, SHE WENT TO WORK ADVOCATING FOR CHILDREN AND FAMILIES.
IT WAS ONE OF HER FIRST FIGHTS AND SINCE THEN, SHE HAS NEVER LET UP.

<strong>Thaddeus Desmond</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> IN HER EARLY 20'S, HILLARY CLINTON SPENT TIME AT THE HOSPITAL RESEARCHING CHILD ABUSE
, SHE SAW CHILDREN WHO HAD BEEN
BEATEN, BURNED, NEGLECTED. THE<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> EXPERIENCE TURNED HER INTO A LIFELONG CHAMPION FOR KIDS IN
NEED.
AS A CHILD ADVOCATE SOCIAL
WORKER, I TOO AM A CHAMPION FOR CHILDREN AND I AM LUCKY TO WORK
WITH A TEAM OF CHAMPIONS, SOCIAL WORKERS, CASE MANAGERS,
ATTORNEYS, OTHER INDIVIDUALS AS
LIFELONG WORK IS TO ENSURE ALL
CHILDREN HAVE A CHANCE AT
GREATNESS. CHILD ADVOCACY HAS MADE
SIGNIFICANT STRIDES IN THE RIGHT
DIRECTION BUT OUR WORK IS FAR
FROM FINISHED. EVERY CHILD DESERVES AN ADVOCATE
WHO TRULY CARES FOR THEM AND
THEY HAVE ONE IN HILLARY CLINTON
.
HILLARY KNOWS THAT WHEN YOU
FIGHT FOR OUR KIDS, YOU ARE
FIGHTING FOR OUR FUTURE AND THAT
IS WHY I'M WITH HER.
