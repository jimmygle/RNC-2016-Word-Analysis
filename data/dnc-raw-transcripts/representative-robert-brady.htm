<strong>Robert A. Brady</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> MR. BRADY: WELCOME TO MY DISTRICT, AND WELCOME TO PHILADELPHIA, THE CITY THAT HAS
MADE AMERICA FREE TO DATE MAKES STREET AGAIN.
-- MAKES HISTORY AGAIN.<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> THIS IS THE HOME OF THE LIBERTY,
BUT INDEPENDENCE AND LIBERTY
HAVE NEVER BEEN GIVEN. WE HAVE TO FIGHT AND DEFEND THESE PRINCIPLES EACH
GENERATION. THAT HAS BEEN THE WORK OF THE
BRAVE MEN AND WOMEN OF THE ARMED SERVICES. TO ALL OF YOU WHO HAVE LOVED ONES SERVING, THANK YOU. TO ALL WHO HAVE DEFENDED OUR FREEDOM BUT NEVER CAME HOME,
THOSE MISSING IN ACTION, WE REMEMBERED YOU. YOU ARE NOT FORGOTTEN. AS AMERICANS LIVING IN FREEDOM,
EACH OF US HAS A RESPONSIBILITY
TO ALWAYS REMEMBER THE SACRIFICES OF THOSE THAT DID NOT COME HOME AND THOSE WHOSE SAFE RETURN WE'RE STILL WAITING FOR. WE HOLD THEM IN OUR HEARTS EVERY
SINGLE DAY. ACROSS THIS GREAT LAND AND
THROUGHOUT GREATER PHILADELPHIA,
IN VENUES FROM CITY HALL'S TO SPORTS ARENAS, AN EMPTY CHAIR
HONORS OUR MISSING HERE IS.
I WAS PROUD TO PASS ALONG AND PLACED SUCH A PLACE IN THE
UNITED STATES CAPITOL AS WELL, AND IN THIS CONVENTION, AND FTC
WILL SERVE AS A REMINDER OF
THOSE MEMBERS AND THOSE P.O.W.'S
AND WHAT THEY DID FOR OUR
COUNTRY.
WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO
REMEMBER. PLEASE TALK TO THE PENNSYLVANIA
DELEGATION WHERE WE KEEP THIS
MEMORIAL, THE POW-MIA NATIONAL
CHAIR OF HONOR RIGHT HERE IN THE
PENNSYLVANIA DELEGATION. NOW I ASK ALL OF YOU TO STAND
AND OBSERVE A MOMENT OF SILENCE FOR P.O.W.-,M.I.A. AMERICANS. PLEASE STAND. THANK YOU, AND THANK YOU FOR HONORING OUR GREAT COMMUNITY. LET'S GIVE THEM ONE MORE ROUND OF APPLAUSE, TO OUR VETERANS. I CANNOT HEAR YOU. HOW ABOUT PENNSYLVANIA? LET'S BREAK IT UP FOR OUR VETERANS.
THANK YOU FOR ALL YOU DO, AND TO
KEEP DONALD TRUMP OUT OF THE WHITE HOUSE, SOMEONE WHO
DISRESPECTS OUR P.O.W.'S LIKE JOHN MCCAIN, AND DO ALL WE CAN
DO TO AF ELECTRONIC SPREAD, HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON.
THANK YOU. GOD BLESS AMERICA.
THANK YOU.</span><span class='hidden-full-transcript-ellipses'>...</span></p><a href='#' class='hidden-full-transcript-link'><i class='icon-chevron-down'></i> <span class='link-show-full-text'>Show Full Text</span><i class='icon-chevron-up'></i> <span class='link-show-less-text'>Show Less Text</span></a>
