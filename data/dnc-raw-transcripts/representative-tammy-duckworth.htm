<p class='short_transcript'> >> 12 YEARS AGO, I WAS CO-PILOTING A BLACK HAWK
HELICOPTER OVER IRAQ. A ROCKET PROPELLED GRENADE RIPPED THROUGH OUR COCKPIT, AND
I AM ONLY HERE TONIGHT<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> BECAUSE
OF THE MIRACLES THAT FOLLOWED. SEMI-CAN EXPLAIN, LIKE THE
BRAVERY OF MY CREW, -- SOME, I CAN EXPLAIN, LIKE THE BRAVERY OF MY CREW, DETERMINED NOT TO LEAVE
ME BEHIND.
SOME I CANNOT, LIKE SHRAPNEL
PASSING THROUGH OUR SPINNING ROTOR BLADES WITHOUT DESTROYING
THEM, ALLOWING US TO LAND.
WHAT I DO KNOW IS THAT I STARTED
THAT DAY DOING WHAT I LOVE. I ENDED IT KNOCKED IT DOWN, SURVIVING ONLY BECAUSE MY
BUDDIES WOULD NOT LEAVE ME AND
WOULD NOT STOP, EVEN AS THEY
STRUGGLE TO CARRY MY BODY.
11 DAYS LATER, I WOKE UP WITH A
DEBT I CAN NEVER REPAY, AND I STILL WAKE UP EVERY MORNING
WORKING TO BE WORTHY OF THEIR
STRUGGLE AND THIS MIRACULOUS
SECOND CHANCE. MY DAD, A PROUD MARINE, LOST HIS JOB IN TH HIS 50'S. HE DID JOBS. MY MOM TOOK IN SEWING.
I TOOK A MINIMUM WAGE JOB. WE RELIED ON FOOD STAMPS TO GET BY. THE SUMMER BEFORE MY COLLEGE STARTED, MY PARENTS WALKED
EVERYWHERE INSTEAD OF TAKING THE BUS.
ONCE A WEEK, THEY HANDED OVER THE SAVED US MONEY, $10, TO THE
UNIVERSITY HOUSING AS A DEPOSIT
WHY COULD MOVE INTO THE DORMS IN THE FALL. THANKS TO TELL GRANTS AND A LOT
OF WAITRESSING, I'VE FULFILLED
MY DREAMS OF COLLEGE. I WORKED HARD, BUT I HAD A LOT OF HELP FROM MY COMMUNITY AND MY
COUNTRY, AND MY STORY IS NOT
UNIQUE. IT IS A STORY ABOUT WHY THIS IS
THE GREATEST NATION ON EARTH, A NATION THAT SO MANY ARE WILLING
TO DIE DEFENDING, A NATION THAT SAYS IF YOU KEEP WORKING HARD, WE WON'T ABANDON YOU. OF COURSE, IN DONALD TRUMP'S AMERICA, IF YOU GET LOCKED --
KNOCKED DOWN, YOU STAY DOWN. BY THE WAY, DONALD TRUMP, I DIDN'T PUT MY LIFE ON THE LINE
DEFENDING OUR DEMOCRACY SO THAT
YOU COULD INVITE RUSSIA TO
INTERFERE WITH IT. YOU ARE NOT FIT TO BE THE
COMMANDER IN CHIEF. MY FELLOW AMERICANS, WE CAN CHOOSE A DIFFERENT PATH. 10 YEARS AFTER MY HELICOPTER WAS
SHOT DOWN, ALMOST TO THE DAY, I GOT MY MOST IMPORTANT JOB. I BECAME A MOM. AND WE NAMED OUR LITTLE GIRL
AFTER ABIGAIL ADAMS, WHO URGED HER HUSBAND TO REMEMBER THE LADIES AS HE AND HIS COLLEAGUES FIRST DECLARED OUR RIGHTS TO LIFE, LIBERTY, AND THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS JUST A FEW MILES
FROM THIS VERY SPOT. OUR ABIGAIL KNOWS THAT WOMEN CAN
FLY HELICOPTERS IN COMBAT. AND MY DAUGHTER'S FIRST MEMORY
OF A PRESIDENT WILL BE OF A
WOMAN. DEMOCRATS. TONIGHT, LET'S GO FORWARD WITH CONFIDENCE AND PRIDE IN WHO WE ARE AND WHAT WE BELIEVE.
WE ARE DEMOCRATS BECAUSE WE
STAND UP FOR THE MOST VULNERABLE
AMONG US.
WE EMBRACE THE NOTION THAT
LIFTING EACH OTHER UP DOESN'T
COST NEARLY AS MUCH AS LEAVING
OTHERS BEHIND. WE STAND UP FOR IMMIGRANTS AND
PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES, AND WE
DEFEND THE BASIC VALUES THAT
HAVE MADE AND WILL KEEP AMERICA THE GREATEST COUNTRY IN THE WORLD.
MAY GOD BLESS EACH AND EVERY ONE
OF YOU AND MAY GOD BLESS OUR TROOPS OV, AND ALWAYS, MAY GOD
BLESS THE UNITED STATES OF
AMERICA. QUAKES HI, LITTLE ONE. IT IS ME. IT'S YOUR DAD.
YOU ARE NOT BORN YET.
I CAN'T WAIT TO MEET YOU.</span><span class='hidden-full-transcript-ellipses'>...</span></p><a href='#' class='hidden-full-transcript-link'><i class='icon-chevron-down'></i> <span class='link-show-full-text'>Show Full Text</span><i class='icon-chevron-up'></i> <span class='link-show-less-text'>Show Less Text</span></a>
