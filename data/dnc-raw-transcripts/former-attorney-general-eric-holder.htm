<strong>Eric H. Holder Jr.</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> THANK YOU. THANK YOU. I HAVE KNOWN HILLARY CLINTON FOR
ALMOST 25 YEARS AS A FRIEND, A COLLEAGUE, AND A LEADER OF COURAGE AND CONVICTION AND TODAY,<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> I'M PROUD TO SAY I STAND WITH HER.
[CHEERS] I HAVE SEEN THAT SHE HAS THE
SKILLS TO SERVE AS COMMANDER IN CHIEF AND THE STRENGTH TO LEAD
OUR ALREADY GREAT NATION IN THIS
HOUR OF CHALLENGE.
DID YOU HEAR WHAT I JUST SAID
? ALREADY GREAT NATION.
DONALD, DID YOU HEAR ME?
" ALREADY GREAT NATION." AT A TIME WHEN THE BONDS OF LAW-ENFORCEMENT AND COMMUNITIES OF COLORS HAVE FRAYED. WHEN PEACEFUL CITIZENS HAVE TO QUESTION WHETHER BLACK LIGHT
TRULY MATTER, AND THEY DO.
[APPLAUSE] WE NEED A PRESIDENT WHO
UNDERSTANDS THE REALITY I SAW IN
MY TRAVELS ACROSS THE COUNTRY AS
OUR NATION'S 82ND ATTORNEY GENERAL, THAT THERE SHOULD BE NO
TENSION IN PROTECTING THOSE WHO
RISK THEIR LIVES TO SERVE AND ENSURING EVERYONE IS TREATED
FAIRLY BY THE POLICE. AS THE BROTHER OF A RETIRED POLICE OFFICER, I AM PROFOUNDLY
AWARE THAT AN ATTACK ON A POLICE
OFFICER ANYWHERE IS AN ATTACK ON OUR ENTIRE SOCIETY.
[APPLAUSE] IT IS NOT ENOUGH, IT IS NOT
ENOUGH FOR US TO PRAISE LAW-ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS AFTER
THEY ARE KILLED. WE MUST PROTECT THEM, VALUE THEM, AND EQUIP THEM WITH THE
RIGHT TOOLS, TACTICS, TRAINING
WHILE THEY ARE STILL ALIVE.
[APPLAUSE] WE MUST ALSO COME TO REALIZE THAT KEEPING OUR OFFICERS SAFE
IS NOT INCONSISTENT WITH
ENSURING THOSE IN LAW ENFORCEMENT TREAT THE PEOPLE
THEY ARE SWORN TO SERVE WITH DIGNITY, RESPECT, AND FAIRNESS. WE MUST COMMIT OURSELVES TO BOTH THOSE. HILLARY UNDERSTANDS THAT THE
GOALS WE SHARE ARE THE SAME.
SAFER COMMUNITIES WITH LESS
CRIME, WHERE ALL OF OUR LOVED
ONES -- POLICE AND COMMUNITY
RESIDENTS -- GET THE CHANCE TO
COME HOME AT NIGHT.
SHE WILL CONTINUE THE WORK THAT
NEEDS TO BE DONE TO REBUILD TRUST BECAUSE SHE KNOWS THAT WE
ARE STRONGER TOGETHER.
[APPLAUSE] BUT LET US THE HONEST, AT A TIME
WHEN OUR JUSTICE SYSTEM IS OUT OF BALANCE, WHEN ONE AND THREE BLACK MEN WILL BE INCARCERATED IN THEIR LIFETIMES, AND WHEN BLACK DEFENDANTS IN THE JUSTICE
SYSTEM WITH SENTENCES 20% LONGER
THAN THEIR WHITE PEERS, WE NEED
A PRESIDENT WHO WILL END THIS POLICY OF OVER INCARCERATION.
[APPLAUSE] AS ATTORNEY GENERAL, I LAUNCHED
SWEEPING REFORMS OF OUR FEDERAL CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM AND REDUCED ITS RELIANCE ON
MANDATORY MINIMUM SENTENCES. AS A RESULT, WE CUT THE FEDERAL
PRISON POPULATION AND THE CRIME
RATE TOGETHER FOR THE FIRST TIME
IN MORE THAN 40 YEARS.
THAT'S RIGHT. THAT'S RIGHT.
[APPLAUSE] DESPITE THE FICTION AND THE FEAR MONGERING YOU HAVE HEARD FROM
THE OTHER PARTY'S NOMINEE, VIOLENT CRIME HAS GONE DOWN
SINCE PRESIDENT OBAMA TOOK
OFFICE. AS PRESIDENT, HILLARY WILL GO EVEN FURTHER. SHE FOUGHT AS A SENATOR AGAINST
SENTENCING DISPARITIES AND RACIAL PROFILING. SHE USED HER FACE -- FIRST MAJOR SPEECH AS A CANDIDATE TO ROLL OUT A BOLD VISION FOR CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM.
SHE HAS TALKED ABOUT SYSTEMIC
RACISM IN A WAY NO ONE ELSE HAS AND SHE WILL HELP OUR NATION
SUMMONED THE COURAGE TO CONFRONT RACIAL INJUSTICE AND FACE DOWN
THE LEGACIES OF OUR DARKEST
PAST. FINALLY, AT A TIME WHEN REPUBLICANS BRAZENLY ASSAULT THE
MOST FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTS OF OUR
DEMOCRACY, LOST TO -- WHERE PEOPLE GET THE DOCUMENTS THEY NEED TO VOTE, WE NEED A
PRESIDENT SENSITIVE TO THE ECHO
OF JIM CROW.
[APPLAUSE] MY FELLOW AMERICANS, HILLARY
CLINTON WILL BE THAT PRESIDENT. SHE WILL SET A NEW STANDARD FOR
EARLY VOTING. SHE WILL CHAMPION UNIVERSAL AUTOMATIC REGISTRATION. YOU TURN 18, YOU ARE REGISTERED
TO VOTE. BECAUSE SHE KNOWS, SHE KNOWS,
AND EVERYBODY IN THIS ARENA HAS
TO KNOW THIS, THE BEST WAY TO
DEFEND THE RIGHT TO VOTE IS BY
EXERCISING IT.
[APPLAUSE] THROUGHOUT HISTORY, TOO MANY PEOPLE HAVE SACRIFICED TOO MUCH, FIVE WARS, -- FIGHT WARS FOR
THIS GENERATION TO SIT ON THE
SIDELINES. NEVER FORGET THAT WE ARE HEIRS TO A REVOLUTION THAT BEGAN JUST
FIVE MILES FROM WHERE WE GATHER
THIS WEEKEND IT'S A CHOICE WE FACE IN THIS PIVOTAL ELECTION IS
ABOUT MORE THAN POLITICS, IT IS
ABOUT THE ARC WE ARE ON AS A
NATION, THE COMPOSITION OF OUR
CHARACTER AS A PEOPLE, AND THE
IDEALS OF EQUALITY, OPPORTUNITY, JUSTICE THAT HAVE ALWAYS MADE
AMERICA GREAT. THESE ARE THE IDEALS FOR WHICH HILLARY CLINTON HAS FOUGHT HER ENTIRE LIFE.
THIS IS THE FIGHT SHE WILL
CONTINUE WHEN WE MAKE HISTORY BY
ELECTING HER THE 45TH PRESIDENT
OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THANK YOU.
