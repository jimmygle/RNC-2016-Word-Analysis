<strong>Unidentified Speaker</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> MY WEDDING WAS ON THE LEFT
THINK THAT PLAN WITH MY MOM. IT WAS A VERY BITTERSWEET DAY.
ONE BIG REMINDER OF THE GIANT HOLE WHERE SHE USED TO BE. MY<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> MOM WAS A BEST FRIEND. SHE WAS THE TYPE OF PRINCIPAL WHO KNEW THE NAME OF EVERY CHILD
IN HER SCHOOL. SHE KNEW THE SIBLINGS, COULD PROBABLY TAKE HOW MANY DOGS AND WHAT BREED THEY WERE. ON THE MORNING OF DECEMBER 14, I
GOT AN EMERGENCY ALERT THAT SAID THERE IS A SHOOTING AT SANDY H OOK. I GRABBED MY PURSE AND I GOT MY
KIDS AND WENT STORMING TO THE
CAR. I KEPT THINKING, THIS ISN'T
REAL. I KNEW I WAS GOING TO WAKE UP
FROM ABOUT.
-- A BAD DREAM. WE WAITED AND WAITED. THEY TOLD US IF YOU ARE IN THIS ROOM, IT IS BECAUSE YOUR FAMILY
MEMBER IS NOT COMING OUT. IT WASN'T UNTIL THE FIRST TIME I
SAW IN WRITING, AGE 47, FEMALE,
DECEASED.
CAUSE OF DEATH, MULTIPLE GUNSHOT WOUNDS. DID -- I REALIZE MY MOM DID NOT
DIE, SHE WAS MURDERED. AND THAT MADE ME ANGRY. THAT MADE ME ACT. HILLARY CLINTON IS THE ONLY CANDIDATE THAT HAS WHAT IT TAKES TO TAKE ON THE GUN LOBBY. NO ONE IS BITING HARDER T -- F IGHTING HARDER TO REFORM THE LAWS.
REMINDS ME OF MY MOTHER. I BELIEVE IN HER. MILLIONS OF OTHER AMERICANS
BELIEVE HER. THERE IS FINALLY SOMEONE WHO CAN
CHANGE THINGS.

<p class='short_transcript'> >> PLEASE WELCOME ERICA SMEGIELSKI FROM PROSPECT,
CONNECTICUT.
[CHEERS]
(music)
>> I SHOULD NOT BE HERE TONIGHT. I DON'T WANT TO BE HERE TONIGHT. I SHOULD<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> BE HOME, LIKE SO MANY
AMERICANS WATCHING ON TV WITH MY MOTHER AS WE NOMINATE THE FIRST
WOMAN TO BE PRESIDENT OF THE
UNITED STATES.
[CHEERS] BUT, MY MOM WAS MURDERED. SO I'M HERE. I'M HERE FOR THE MOTHERS AND DAUGHTERS WHO ARE PLANNING WEDDINGS SO THAT YOU GET TO
WATCH YOUR DAUGHTERS WALKED DOWN THE AISLE. I'M HERE FOR THOSE LIVES CUT SHORT IN A SCHOOL, AND A MOVIE THEATER, AND A CHURCH, AT WORK,
IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OR HOMES,
BECAUSE THE VOICES SHOULD NEVER BE SILENT.
[CHEERS] I'M HERE ALONE WITHOUT MY
MOTHER. TOO MANY POLITICIANS POWER BEHIND THE GUN LOBBY INSTEAD OF STANDING WITH AMERICANS.
[CHEERS] WE DON'T NEED ANOTHER CHARLESTON OR SAN BERNARDINO OR DALLAS OR COUNTLESS OTHER ACTS OF EVERYDAY
GUN VIOLENCE THAT DON'T MAKE THE GUN VIOLENCE HEADLINES.
WE DON'T NEED OUR TEACHERS AND
KIDS WAS GOING TO WORK IN FEAR.
WHAT WE NEED IS ANOTHER MOTHER
WHO IS WILLING TO DO WHAT IS RIGHT.
[CHEERS] WHOSE BRAVERY CAN LIVE UP IN
EQUAL MEASURE TO MY MOMS. WHAT WE NEED IS TO ELECT HILLARY
CLINTON AT THE 45TH PRESIDENT OF
THE UNITED STATES AMATEUR SO
THAT NO OTHER DAUGHTER HAS TO SAY I WOULD GIVE EVERY SINGLE DAY THAT I HAVE LEFT FOR JUST
ONE MORE DAY WITH MY MOM.
