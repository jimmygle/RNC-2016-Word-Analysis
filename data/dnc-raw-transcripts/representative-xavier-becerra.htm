<strong>Unidentified Speaker</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> GOOD EVENING, BUENAS NOCHES,
THANK YOU. HOW ABOUT WE THANK ALL OF THE VOLUNTEERS, THE POLICE OFFICERS
AND THE SECURITY THAT WERE SET UP, FIEND US --<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> FED US, MADE
THIS CONVENTION A SUCCESS? 
[APPLAUSE] NOW ANYONE HERE A DEMOCRAT OR
CHILD OR GRANDCHILDREN OF IMMIGRANTS? ANYONE THE FIRST IN YOUR FAMILY
TO GO TO COLLEGE? 
WHO HERE MAKES A LIVING WORKING WITH YOUR HANDS, MAKING THIS COUNTRY BETTER? THIS IS WHAT A GREAT AMERICA
LOOKS LIKE. SO WHEN I HEAR SOMEONE SAY,
AMERICA IS NOT GREAT, IT HITS
ME.
WHEN I HEAR SOMEONE SAY YOUR
FATHER WAS JUST A DITCH DIGGER,
YOUR MOTHER WAS NOT EVEN BORN HERE, THIS ELECTION IS ABOUT US. IT IS PERSONAL.
IT IS ABOUT TELLING EVERY LITTLE BOY AND EVERY LITTLE GIRL YOU
CAN BE A PRESIDENT OF UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.
[APPLAUSE] WHEN SHE WAS 18, MY MOM CAME
FROM OUT OF THE HARDER -- GUADELAJARA, JALISCO, MEXICO.
SHE JUGGLED HER WORK AT HOME.
AND MY FATHER HAD TO LEAVE
SCHOOL BY THE SIXTH GRADE TO
HELP SUPPORT THE FAMILY. I REMEMBER HE WOULD LEAVE FOR WORK LONG BEFORE MY THREE SISTERS AND I WOULD GET UP FOR
SCHOOL. YOU WORK IN THE FIELDS AND IN
CONSTRUCTION, YOU RISE WITH THE
SUN. IN WINTER, WHEN SACRAMENTO
TURNED COLD AND RAINY AND
CONSTRUCTION JOBS DISAPPEARED,
MY DAD WOULD FIND OTHER WORK,
LAYING A TILE FLOOR, CANNING
TOMATOES OR HAULING SOMEONE'S TRASH. MY PARENTS DID NOT GO TO COLLEGE, BUT THEY ENCOURAGED US. AND LIKE SO MANY OF YOU, I BEGIN
THE FIRST IN MY FAMILY TO
GRADUATE WITH A FOUR YEAR
DEGREE.
[APPLAUSE] I KNOW THAT EDUCATIONAL STORY.
HILLARY CLINTON GETS THAT. SHE UNDERSTANDS THAT EVERY CHILD DESERVES A GREAT EDUCATION, NO
MATTER THEIR ZIP CODE. AS FIRST LADY OF ARKANSAS, HILLARY HAD WHAT SHE CALLED THE CHELSEA TEST.
IF A SCHOOL WAS NOT GOOD ENOUGH
FOR HER DAUGHTER, IT WAS NOT
GOOD ENOUGH FOR ANYONE'S CHILD.
THAT IS WHY AS PRESIDENT, SHE WILL BRING PRESCHOOL TO EVERY FOUR-YEAR-OLD IN AMERICA.
SHE WILL REBUILD OUR CRUMBLING SCHOOLS.
SHE WILL REBUILD OUR TEACHERS
AND GIVE THEM THE SUPPORT AND
TOOLS THEY NEED AND THE THINGS
THEY DESERVE.
-- THE PAY A DESERVE. HOW MANY OF YOU HAVE STUDENT
DEBT? HILLARY WILL FIGHT FOR DEBT FREE COLLEGE TUITION, BECAUSE NOBODY
SHOULD BE PRICED OUT OF COLLEGE. AND SHE WILL ENSURE FOLKS AND REAGAN FINDS -- AND REFINANCE
LOANS, BECAUSE NO ONE SHOULD BE CRUNCHED DOWN BY STUDENT DEBT. I RECENTLY WENT WITH CAROLINA MY WIFE TO WITNESS OUR YOUNGEST
DAUGHTER GRADUATE FROM HIGH SCHOOL. NATALIA ROSE, THE SKY IS THE
LIMIT. HILLARY ONCE FOR ALL CHILDREN WHAT WE GIVE TO OUR CHILDREN -- WANTS FOR OUR CHILDREN WHAT WE
GIVE TO OUR CHILDREN.
SHE WANTS TO BUILD SCHOOLS. TRUMP WANTS TO BUILD WALLS. HIS EDUCATION IDEA, TRUMP
UNIVERSITY. HE ONCE DEMANDED THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA RELEASE HIS COLLEGE
TRANSCRIPTS BECAUSE IT WOULD BE
"VERY REVEALING." YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK? I THINK IT WOULD BE VERY REVEALING FOR DONALD TRUMP TO
RELEASE HIS COLLEGE TRANSCRIPT.
[APPLAUSE] WHO HERE THINKS HE DID AS WELL
AS HE SAID HE DID? AT EVERY STAGE IN HIS LIFE, DONALD TRUMP HAS EXPLOITED
AMERICA'S LAWS TO PUT HIMSELF
FIRST.
HE USED HIS LAWSUITS TO WIN MY MOM -- THE WAY MY MOTHER USES COUPONS TO BUY A PRODUCT.
HE USES BANKRUPTCIES, SIX OF THEM, LIKE A WEALTHY MAN'S GET
OUT OF JAIL FREE CARD. I CAN'T TELL YOU IF HE HAS EVER HAD A CALLOUS ON HIS HANDS.
DOES HE KNOW THE PRICE OF A
GALLON OF MILK, A LOBE OF BREAD?

-- LOAF OF BREAD.
WHY WANT THE RELEASE HIS TAX RETURNS? WHAT IS HE HIDING? WHY WILL HE SHOW THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WHO HE IS? 
-- WHY WON'T HE SHOW THE
AMERICAN PEOPLE WHO HE IS? LETTER TO YOU ABOUT HILLARY
CLINTON. SHE CAME TO MY CITY OF LOS ANGELES AND SAT DOWN WITH PEOPLE
LIKE MY PARENTS, GRANDMOTHERS, DREAMERS, AND MEN WHO WORK ALL
DAY IN THE SUN BUT REMAIN IN THE
SHADOWS.
AS THE MEETING ENDED, THE CROWD
SWELLED ALL AROUND HER. SHE TOOK EVERY PHOTO REQUESTED WITH FAMILIES WHO HAD NEVER BEEN
CLOSE TO A FUTURE PRESIDENT. PEOPLE WHO COULD NOT EVEN VOTE.
SHE EMBRACED THEM. SHE LISTENED TO THEM. AND GUESS WHAT? SHE PROVED THAT SHE CARES. IT IS THESE MOMENTS THAT MAKE
THIS ELECTION PERSONAL, THAT
DEFINE WHO OF PRESIDENT WILL BE,
THAT HILLARY CLINTON FOR 24 YEARS HAS ALWAYS LISTENED TO
THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN SILENT. OUR NEXT VICE PRESIDENT TIM KAINE [SPEAKING SPANISH] HE
LISTENS TO US TOO. WE HAVE COME A LONG WAYS WHEN MY DAD COULD NOT WALK INTO A
RESTAURANT BECAUSE OF THE SIGNS
THAT READ NO DOGS OR MEXICANS ALLOWED. NOW IS NOT THE TIME TO TURN BACK. THERE IS A SAYING IN SPANISH, [ SPEAKING SPANISH] TELL ME WITH
WHOM YOU WALK, AND I WILL TELL
YOU WHO YOU ARE. HILLARY CLINTON HAS WALKED WITH US ALL HER LIFE. NO MATTER WHO WE ARE OR WHERE WE COME FROM OR WHAT WE LOOK LIKE
OR HOW MUCH MONEY WE HAVE OR WHO WE LOVE, HILLARY CLINTON WALKS
WITH US. SO NOW, THE QUESTION IS, ARE WE
READY TO WALK WITH HER? ARE WE GOING TO FIGHT WERE A NATION WHERE LOVE TRUMPS HATE? 
AN AMERICA THAT IS STRONGER TOGETHER? THEN LET'S ELECT THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, HILLARY CLINTON. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
