<strong>Unidentified Speaker</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> IF I HAD TO DESCRIBE PAT IN ONE WORD, IT WOULD BE LOVING. WE GREW UP AND GOT MARRIED AND
WE WERE 21.
HE WAS A FAMILY MAN. WHATEVER TIME HE WAS ABLE<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> TO
SPEND WITH US, HE WAS THERE.
WHATEVER HE CAN DO TO HELP THEM PROTECT, THAT IS WHAT HE
WANTED TO DO. IT'S ONE OF THE REASONS I FELL
IN LOVE WITH HIM.
HE REALIZED HE COULD DO THAT AND FLY IF HE JOINED THE ARMY. HE TOOK THE JOB VERY SERIOUSLY. ANY TIME HE WAS HOME HE ANSWERED
TO THAT LITTLE GIRL.
WE WERE HIS WORLD. PATRICK WAS IN IRAQ IN TWO DOZEN FOR.
HIS UNIT WAS CALLED OUT TO DO A
SEARCH AND RESCUE. PATRICK CRASHED TRYING TO SAVE
THE LIVES OF OTHERS. THAT WAS THE KIND OF PERSON HE WAS. I WAS NUMB. I LOST MY HUSBAND, MY BEST FRIEND, AND MY DAUGHTER LOST HER DAD. LOSING PAT SHOOK OUR FOUNDATION. IT WAS LIKE, OK, WHAT DO WE DO NEXT? HILLARY CLINTON RELEASED SOME OF
THE FINANCIAL STRESS. Y -- IT ALLOWED ME TO FOCUS ON ME AND MY DAUGHTER, TO HEAL,
TO GIVE HER A STABLE HOME. WHAT HILLARY HAS DONE FOR OUR FAMILY AND OTHER MILITARY FAMILIES, WORDS CAN'T EVEN DESCRIBE IT. SHE UNDERSTANDS WHAT OUR COUNTRY
NEEDS. 12 YEARS AGO SHE UNDERSTOOD WHAT
OUR FAMILY NEEDED. SHE HAVE THE GUMPTION TO GET
THINGS DONE. THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT YOU WANT
AND OUR PRESIDENT.
-- IN OUR PRESIDENT.

<strong>Jamie Dorff</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> MRS. DORFF: THANK YOU, THANK
YOU. I WILL NEVER FORGET THE MOMENT I
HEARD THAT PATRICK'S HELICOPTER DID NOT RETURN. IN AN INSTANT THE LIFE I KNEW
WAS DESTROYED.<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> THE PARTNER I LOVED DAWN.
-- GONE. MY DAUGHTER'S FATHER TAKEN AWAY
FOREVER. I NEVER FELT MORE SCARED OR ALONE THAN I DID THEN. I WONDERED WHAT CHRISTMAS AND
BIRTHDAYS WITH LOOK LIKE. HALF THE COUNTRY AWAY, A UNITED
STATES SENATOR WAS LOOKING OUT FOR ME AND COUNTLESS OTHERS LIKE
ME. HER NAME WAS HILLARY CLINTON. BEFORE HILLARY, THE FAMILY'S RECEIVED $12,000. YET WHEN YOU NEED TO BURY YOUR BEST FRIEND, WHEN YOU NEED TO RAISE A CHILD UNDER OWN, WHEN
YOU NEED TO REBUILD YOUR LIFE FROM RUBBLE, $12,000 DOES NOT GO
FAR. HILLARY UNDERSTOOD SO SHE DID
SOMETHING ABOUT IT. WITHOUT FUSS OR FANFARE, SHE
WORKED ACROSS PARTY LINES. SHE LED CONGRESS TO INCREASE SURVIVOR BENEFITS TO $100,000. IT MADE ALL THE DIFFERENCE IN
THE WORLD.
[APPLAUSE] LOOKING BACK ON IT, I DIDN'T
EVEN REALIZE IT WAS RESPONSIBLE. WHEN I DID LEARN ABOUT HILLARY'S WORK, I DIDN'T SEE HER AS A DEMOCRAT OR A REPUBLICAN. I SIMPLY SAW FIGHTER FOR PEOPLE LIKE US, FOR FAMILIES LIKE MINE. SHE STOOD UP FOR THE PRINCIPLES
THAT A FAMILY'S PERSONAL TRAGEDY
WAS NOT BE A FINANCIAL TRAGEDY
AS WELL. TODAY MY DAUGHTER IS FINISHING HIGH SCHOOL. SHE IS COMPLETING HER DEGREE, I'M COMPLETING MY DEGREE IN
EMERGENCY CRISIS MANAGEMENT. COMMITTED TO SERVING MY COUNTRY
IN THE BEST WAY I CAN.
[APPLAUSE] AND OUR FAMILY IS MAKING IT. STEP-BY-STEP, DAY BY DAY. HILLARY CLINTON HAS FOUGHT FOR
FAMILIES LIKE MINE EACH AND
EVERY DAY OF HER CAREER. THIS IS A WOMAN WHO I HAVE NEVER MET WHOSE LIFE'S BEEN NOT
BE ANY MORE DIFFERENT FROM MY OWN, BUT WHO HAS TO WITH MY
FAMILY AND ME OVER AND OVER AGAIN. HILLARY HAS ALWAYS BEEN WITH ME
AND BAD TIMES AND THAT IS WHY
I'M WITH HER. THANK YOU.
