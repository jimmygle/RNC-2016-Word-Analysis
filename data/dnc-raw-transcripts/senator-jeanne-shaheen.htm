<strong>Jeanne Shaheen</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> THANK YOU, DELEGATES.
[CHEERING] THANK YOU PAM LIVENGOOD FOR SHARING YOUR FAMILY STORY HERE
TODAY. I APPLAUD YOUR COURAGE. DEMOCRATS STAND WITH YOU,<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> YOUR FAMILY AND ALL FAMILIES STRUGGLING WITH ADDICTION. AND PRESIDENT HILLARY CLINTON WILL STAND WITH YOU AND WE WILL
WIN THIS FIGHT TOGETHER.
[CHEERING] THE OPIOIDS AND HEROIN EPIDEMIC
IS RAVAGING COMMUNITIES ALL ACROSS THIS COUNTRY.
IS A CRISIS THAT AFFECTS OLD AND YOUNG, RICH AND POOR, MEN AND WOMEN, DEMOCRATS AND
REPUBLICANS. AND IT WILL TAKE ALL OF US WORKING TOGETHER TO DEFEAT IT. ACROSS MY HOME STATE OF NEW HAMPSHIRE, THE AWFUL TOLL GROWS EACH YEAR. 192 OVERDOSES AND 2013, 326 COUNTIES IN 2014.
-- FATALITIES IN 2014. 433 FATALITIES IN 2015. THE STATISTICS TELL A STORY OF A
STAGGERING EPIDEMIC. BUT STATISTICS CANNOT FULLY
CAPTURE THE PROFOUND HUMAN TOLL. IT IS NOT ONLY THOUSANDS OF INDIVIDUAL LIVES THAT HAVE BEEN DESTROYED, ENTIRE COMMUNITIES
ARE BEING DEVASTATED. HILLARY CLINTON TO THE EPIDEMIC
AND HIS TERRIFIC TOLL BECAUSE SHE CAME TO NEW HAMPSHIRE, NOT
TO TALK, BUT TO LISTEN. AND SHE HEARD STORIES LIKE PAM'S
. STORIES LIKE THE ONE I RECENTLY
HEARD ABOUT A YOUNG MAN FULL OF PROMISE, ON HIS WAY TO COLLEGE
WHEN HE SUFFERED A SPORTS
INJURY. GOT ADDICTED TO PAINKILLERS, SWITCH TO HEROIN AND NOW INSTEAD
OF LIVING ON THE FRESHMAN CLAUDE, -- QUAD, HE IS LIVING ON
THE STREET AND HANDLING. HILLARY HEARD HOW ATTICS ARE
BEING TURNED AWAY FROM TREATMENT FACILITIES DUE TO A LACK OF
RESOURCES. AND HILLARY HEARD FROM ONE ENFORCEMENT -- LAW ENFORCEMENT. SHE KNOWS THAT DRUG COUNSELORS
AND POLICE OFFICERS AND THE
OTHER INCREDIBLE PEOPLE ON THE FRONT LINES ARE HEROES. THEY ARE DOING AMAZING WORK, BUT
THEY NEED OUR HELP. MORE THAN 47,000 AMERICANS DIED
FROM DRUG OVERDOSES IN 2014. HILLARY CLINTON KNOWS WE CANNOT
CONTINUE ON THIS PATH. SHE KNOWS BECAUSE DURING THIS CAMPAIGN SHE LISTENED AND NEW
HAMPSHIRE AND ACROSS THE
COUNTRY. SHE LISTENED, SHE LEARNED AND
SHE PUT TOGETHER A PLAN TO TREAT THIS LIKE THE HEALTH EMERGENCY THAT IT IS. AND TO DEPLOY THE NECESSARY RESOURCES TO FIGHT IT. HER PLAN WOULD INFEST AND SOME
SIMPLE GOALS. EMPOWER COMMUNITIES TO PREVENT DRUG USE AMONG TEENAGERS. AND EVERY PERSON SUFFERING FROM ADDICTION CAN OBTAIN
COMPREHENSIVE TREATMENT. ENSURE THAT ALL FIRST RESPONDERS CARRY NARCANS WHICH CAN STOP
OVERDOSES FROM BECOMING FATAL. AND PRIORITIZE TREATMENT OVER PRISON FOR LOW-LEVEL AND NONVIOLENT DRUG OFFENSES. WE CAN END THE ERA OF MASS INCARCERATION.
[CHEERING] EARLY THIS YEAR, I'VE PUT FORTH
AN EMERGENCY SPENDING BILL TO
PAY FOR POLICING, PREVENTION AND
TREATMENT. SADLY, IT WAS DEFEATED BY
REPUBLICANS. DONALD TRUMP CERTAINLY DOESN'T
HAVE A PLAN TO DEAL WITH THIS
HEALTH AND ENDEMIC -- EPIDEMIC. DONALD TRUMP DOES NOT SEEM TO KNOW WHAT IS HAPPENING OUTSIDE
OF TRUMP TOWER. AND HE SEEMS COMPLETELY UNINTERESTED IN FINDING OUT. HOW CAN DONALD TRUMP REPRESENT AMERICA WHEN HE DOES NOT EVEN
TAKE THE TIME TO KNOW AMERICA?
[CHEERING] WE NEED A PRESIDENT WHO LISTENS, WHO LEARNS, WHO HAS EMPATHY AND
WHO WANTS THE SAME OPPORTUNITIES FOR ALL CHILDREN THAT SHE HAS
HAD. WHO WANTS IN AMERICA WHERE WE GO
FOR TOGETHER. WE NEED PRESIDENT HILLARY CLINTON.
