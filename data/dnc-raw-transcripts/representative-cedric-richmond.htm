BECAUSE MY MOTHER WAS A STRONG
WOMAN. AFTER MY FATHER DIED, FOR A
WHILE SHE HAD TO DO THE JOB<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> OF
BOTH PARENTS. BUT SHE DIDN'T DO IT ALONE. THEY REQUIRED FOR HELP WITH SCHOOL TEACHERS, BASEBALL
COACHES, OUR ELDERS, AND
ESPECIALLY THE CHURCH. AND IT TOOK A STRONG DEMOCRATIC PARTY THAT INVESTED IN OUR COMMUNITY, THAT INVESTED IN ME. THROUGH BLOOD, SWEAT, AND TEARS, OUR ELDERS AND OUR PARTY CREATED THE ENVIRONMENT FOR ME TO
SUCCEED. BECAUSE OF THAT BLOOD THAT SWEAT,, AND THOSE TEARS, I CAN SET, EAT, AND LIVE WHEREVER I
WANT. I CAN VOTE WITHOUT ANSWERING HOW
MANY BUBBLES IN A BAR OF SOAP. AND BECAUSE OF BLOOD, SWEAT, AND TEARS, THE OBAMAS RESIDE AT 1600 PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE.</span><span class='hidden-full-transcript-ellipses'>...</span></p><a href='#' class='hidden-full-transcript-link'><i class='icon-chevron-down'></i> <span class='link-show-full-text'>Show Full Text</span><i class='icon-chevron-up'></i> <span class='link-show-less-text'>Show Less Text</span></a>

<strong>AS THE</strong>

"THE WORLD WILL LOVE ME, DARK AND DEEP, BUT I HAVE PROMISES TO KEEP, AND MILES TO GO BEFORE I
SLEEP." WE HAVE MADE GREAT STRIDES<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> UNDER PRESIDENT OBAMA, BUT WE STILL
HAVE MILES TO GO. WE'HEN OUR KIDS HAVE BETTER ACCESS TO GUNS AND DRUGS AND
TEXTBOOKS AND COMPUTERS, WE HAVE
MILES TO GO BEFORE WE SLEEP. WHEN WOMEN DON'T MAKE THE SAME
WAGE AS A MAN, WE HAVE MILES TO GO BEFORE WE SLEEP. WHEN WE CAN'T GIVE THEET
REPUBLICANS TO JOIN US TO ENACT SENSIBLE GUN REFORMS, WE HAVE MILES TO GO BEFORE WE
SLEEP. WHEN THE NRA HAS NEUTERED AN
ENTIRE REPUBLICAN PARTY, WE HAVE
MILES TO GO BEFORE WE SLEEP. WE NEED HILLARY CLINTON, BECAUSE
SHE DOESN'T SLEEP. SO THIS FALL, WHEN YOU ARE OUT
THERE CAMPAIGNING FOR HILLARY,
AND YOU START TO FEEL EXHAUSTED, TO THE POINT THAT YOU JUST CAN'T
GO ON, DO ME A FAVOR. MAKE JUST ONE MORE CALL. KNOCK ONE MORE DOOR. BECAUSE WE STILL HAVE MILES TO
GO BEFORE WE SLEEP. GOD BLESS YOU, GOD BLESS LOUISIANA, AND GOD BLESS THE
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.</span><span class='hidden-full-transcript-ellipses'>...</span></p><a href='#' class='hidden-full-transcript-link'><i class='icon-chevron-down'></i> <span class='link-show-full-text'>Show Full Text</span><i class='icon-chevron-up'></i> <span class='link-show-less-text'>Show Less Text</span></a>
