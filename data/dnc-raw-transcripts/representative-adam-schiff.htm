<strong>Adam B. Schiff</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> REP. SCHIFF: THANK YOU. AS THE RANKING DEMOCRAT ON THE
HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE, I
AM AWARE OF THE GRAVE THREATS WE
FACE. FROM THE MURDEROUS BRUTALITY<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> OF
ISIS AND AL QAEDA, TO MY RUNS SPONSORSHIP OF TERROR, FROM THE
BELLIGERENCE OF THE VLADIMIR PUTIN TO THE MAD MEN IN PYONGYANG, THIS NOVEMBER
AMERICA'S DECISION IS ABOUT MORE THAN WHO CONFRONTS THESE THREATS, IT'S ALSO ABOUT HOW. WILL WE CONTINUE TO BE A BEGIN FOR THE FREEDOM LOVING PEOPLES AROUND THE WORLD? OR WILL WE HUNKERED DOWN,
SHELTER IN PLACE, OR WORSE, SOW DIVISION AND DISCORD. WILL WE PICKED A MAN WITH NO
VISION WHO COWERS BEHIND ANGRY
RHETORIC, OR WILL WE PICKED A WOMAN OF COURAGE, CONVICTION,
AND PASSION? IN SHORT, THE STAKES COULD NOT
BE HIGHER. WHEN THE RIGHT OF EXPRESSION RELIGION AND ASSOCIATION ARE UNDER ASSAULT AROUND THE GLOBE, WHEN THE WORLD NEEDS A LEADER
THAT CAN OFFER BLOOD, TEARS,
TOIL AND SWEAT, TRUMP OFFERS
ONLY BLUSTER, TIRADE, TEDIUM,
AND THREAT. WITH MALICE TOWARDS ALL THE
CHARITY FOR NONE, TRUMP WOULD
SEPARATE US FROM THE WORLD AND DIVIDE US HERE AT HOME. IN TRUMP'S WORLD, NATO IS A RELIC, PUTIN AND ALLY, CINNAMON AND EXAMPLE, AND TORTURE OUR INSTRUMENT. IS NOT LEADERSHIP, THIS IS
CALAMITY.
[APPLAUSE] IT IS NOT SPEAKING HARD TRUTHS OR SHUTTING POLITICAL CORRECTNESS, BUT INSTEAD FAILING
TO SEE AMERICA'S GREATNESS. IT'S ESSENTIAL GOODNESS, IT'S UNENDING PROMISE. TRUMP WHAT HAVE US THROW THE
DICE WITH AMERICA'S FUTURE. WE WILL NOT DO IT.
[APPLAUSE] BUT THANK GOD AMERICA HAS A CHOICE. RATHER THAN A MAN OF ENDLESS EGO AND OBSESSION, WE CAN CHOOSE A WOMAN OF PURPOSE AND DETERMINATION. INSTEAD OF A MAN THAT SEES
LITTLE BUT DANGER AND MURDER IN
THE FACE OF IMMIGRANTS, WE CAN CHOOSE A WOMAN WHO UNDERSTANDS
HOW IMMIGRANTS HAVE STRENGTHENED
THIS NATION OF IMMIGRANTS.
[APPLAUSE] INSTEAD OF A MAN WHO WOULD
GAMBLE ON THE GREATNESS OF AMERICA, WE CAN CHOOSE A WOMAN
WITH A BRILLIANT MIND, A RESOLUTE HEART, A STEADY HAND,
AND A PASSION FOR THE BETTERMENT
OF HUMANKIND. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THIS FALSE
THE CHOICE FOR COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF IS CLEAR. HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON.
