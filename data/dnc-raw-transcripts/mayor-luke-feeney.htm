<strong>Bob Casey Jr.</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> WELCOME TO PHILADELPHIA. THE PLACE WHERE AMERICAN
INDEPENDENCE BEGAN AND WHERE OUR
CONSTITUTION WAS BORN. SINCE THE TIME OF WILLIAM PENN,
PENNSYLVANIA<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> HAS BEEN A
COMMONWEALTH OF CREATORS AND MAKERS, BUILDERS WHO INVENT THE
FUTURE. MY FATHER, GOVERNOR KASICH
BELIEVED THAT WE MUST NEVER FORGET THAT THE SWEAT AND BLOOD OF WORKING MEN AND WOMEN WHO BUILT THE WINDS -- PENNSYLVANIA FOR ITS THE INDUSTRIAL
REVOLUTION IN OUR COUNTRY AND
OUR PRODUCED THE WORLD.
-- OUT PRODUCED THE WORLD. OVER THE YEARS, THE HILLARY CLINTON UNDERSTANDS THIS. SHE WILL WORK EVERY DAY TO BUILD
AN ECONOMY THAT WORKS FOR EVERYONE, NOT JUST THOSE AT THE TOP. BUT WHAT ABOUT DONALD TRUMP? DONALD SAYS HE STANDS FOR WORKERS AND HE WILL PUT AMERICA FIRST, BUT THAT IS NOT HOW HE
HAS CONDUCTED HIMSELF IN
BUSINESS.
WHERE ARE HIS TREMENDOUS TRUMP PRODUCT MADE? DRESCHER, BANGLADESH. FURNITURE, TURKEY. AT FRIENDS, INDIA. WINEGLASSES, FLAMINIA. NET TIES, CHINA. CHINA. WHY WOULD DONALD TRUMP MAKE
PRODUCTS IN EVERY CORNER OF THE
WORLD BUT NOT OUT TO NOT, -- PHILADELPHIA?
[CHEERING] THIS IS WHAT HE SAYS. OUTSOURCING IS NOT ALWAYS A
TERRIBLE THING. WAGES IN AMERICA ARE TOO HIGH. THEN HE COMPLAINED ABOUT
COMPANIES MOVING JOBS OVERSEAS
BECAUSE WE DON'T MAKE THINGS ANY
MORE. REALLY?
TELL THAT TO THE UNION WORKERS AT CANONSBURG TO MAKE POTS AND PANS THAT IN MANY OF OUR
KITCHENS.
[CHEERING] TELL THAT TO THE EMPLOYEES OF HATFIELD WHO CREATE TOYS THAT
TEACH OUR CHILDREN ABOUT
ENGINEERING AND ARCHITECTURE. TELL THAT TO THE ROBOTIC STUDENT
AT CARNEGIE MELLON WERE BUILDING
21ST CENTURY ROBOTS AND CARS
THAT DRIVE THEMSELVES.
[CHEERING] DONALD TRUMP HAS NOT MADE ANYTHING EXCEPT A BOOK ON THE BACK OF WORKING PEOPLE. IF HE IS A CHAMPION OF WORKING PEOPLE, ON THE STARTING CENTER
FOR THE 76ERS.
[CHEERING] THE MAN WHO ONCE TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT DOES NOT MAKE ANYTHING IN
AMERICA. IT IS INSULTING THAT HE HAS NO
PLAN, NO PLAN TO SUPPORT THE MEN AND WOMEN WERE MANUFACTURED PRODUCTS HERE AT HOME. ALL HE HAS ARE EMPTY PROMISES
LIKE SO MANY HE HAS MADE AND
FAILED TO FOLLOW THROUGH ON BIG
FOR -- BEFORE.IF YOU BELIEVE THAT OUTSOURCING HAS BEEN GOOD FOR WORKING PEOPLE,
AND HAS RAISED INCOMES FOR THE MIDDLE CLASS, THEN YOU SHOULD VOTE FOR DONALD TRUMP. I'M PUTTING FOR HILLARY CLINTON.
[CHEERING] HILLARY BELIEVES WE NEED AN ECONOMY THAT WORKS FOR EVERYONE,
NOT JUST DONALD TRUMP AND THOSE
AT THE TOP. WE NEED TO COMMIT OURSELVES TO
MAKING GOOD PAINT JOBS HERE AT HOME SO THAT EVERYONE WHO WORKS HARD CAN STAY THERE. THAT IS WHEN OUR FIRST 100 DAYS
IN OFFICE, PRESIDENT CLINTON
WILL PUT FORWARD THE LARGEST INVESTMENT IN GOOD PAINT JOBS
SINCE WORLD WAR II.
-- PAYING JOBS SINCE WORLD WAR
II.
HE WILL REWARD BUSINESSES THAT
SHARE PROFITS WITH THEIR
EMPLOYEES.
SHE WILL SLAP A NEW X ATTACK -- EXIT TAX THAT PUNISHES COUNTRIES
THAT MOVE OVERSEAS. HE WILL STRENGTHEN THE ECONOMY BY INVESTING $10 BILLION IN NEW ADVANCED MANUFACTURING JOBS THAT
CAN'T BE SENT OVERSEAS. THIS NOVEMBER, WE HAVE A CHOICE. YOU CAN CHOOSE THE CANDIDATE WAS ONLY OUT FOR THEMSELVES, WHO WANT TO GET RID OF THE FEDERAL MINIMUM WAGE AND HE WOULD CUT TAXES FOR THE RICHEST AMERICANS
AT THE EXPENSE OF THE MIDDLE
CLASS. OR YOU CAN CHOOSE HILLARY CLINTON, A LEADER WITH A PROVEN TRACK RECORD OF FIGHTING FOR AN
ECONOMY THAT WORKS FOR ALL OF US. IF YOU ARE FOR HER LIKE I AM,
SIGN UP AND VOLUNTEER AT THE CLINTON.COM.
-- HILLARYCLINTON.COM. THANK YOU.
[CHEERING] LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, PLEASE
GIVE A WARM WELCOME TO LOOT FROM
CHILLICOTHE, OHIO.

<strong>Luke Feeney</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> HELLO, OHIO!
[CHEERING] I'M PROUD TO SERVE THE GREAT
PEOPLE OF HISTORIC CHILLICOTHE. OHIO'S FIRST CAPITAL. AND I'M PROUD TO BE ONE OF THE MANY OHIOANS<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> SUPPORTING HILLARY CLINTON.
[CHEERING] WHEN I THINK ABOUT THE STAKE
THIS NOVEMBER, I THINK ABOUT A
WOMAN FROM OUR HOMETOWN NAMED COURTNEY LEWIS.
HER DAD WORKED AT THE LOCAL
PAPER MILL. SHE DID OF OPENING HER OWN BILL FOR HER AND HER CITY.
SHE DID NOT LIKE THE FANCY BUILDING DOWNTOWN.
SHE WANTED TO DO HER PART. SO, SHE MOVED INTO A VACANT STOREFRONT AND WITH TWO
PARTNERS, STARTED A LOCAL GIFT SHOP. THREE YEARS LATER, IT IS A SMALL
TOWNS OR AND IT IS NOT THE ONLY
ONE. CHILLICOTHE IS ON THE RISE. APPALACHIA IS ON THE RISE. IT IS THANKS TO SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS LIKE COURTNEY. I TELL COURTNEY STORY TONIGHT NOT BECAUSE IT IS UNIQUE, BUT IT IS BECAUSE IT IS NOT. ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY,
THOUSANDS OF ENTREPRENEURS AND
SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS ARE EQUALLY READY TO DRAW GROWTH IN THE COMMUNITY, ALL THEY NEED IS
A CHANCE. THE LAST THING OHIOANS NEED IS A PRESIDENT WHO HAS CRUSHED SMALL
BUSINESSES BY NOT PAYING THEM
FOR THE WORK THEY DID. THE LAST THING NEEDS IS DONALD
TRUMP.
[CHEERING] HILLARY'S DAD WAS A SMALL BUSINESS OWNER.
SHE GETS IT. HILLARY KNOWS THAT AMERICA WORKS
BEST WHEN IT WORKS FOR EVERYONE.
AND SHE HAS A PLAN. TO MAKE IT ENTREPRENEURS HAVE
ALL THE TOOLS THEY NEED TO SUCCEED.
LESS RED TAPE, MORE ACTIVE CAPITAL LIKE BIGGER BUSINESSES
HAVE. A MORE EVEN PLAYING FIELD.
AND A WIDER PATH TO PROSPERITY,
FOR ALL OF US. MAYORS OF SMALL TOWNS ACROSS THE COUNTRY NEEDED PRESIDENT WHO WILL BE A FRIEND TO SMALL BUSINESS, WHO WILL BE A PARTNER
IN OUR RESEARCH AND. HILLARY KNOWS AMERICAN SUCCESS STORIES START IN PLACES LIKE CHILLICOTHE. THAT IS WHY WE ARE WITH HER. THAT IS WHY CHILLICOTHE IS WITH
HER. THAT IS WHY OHIO IS WITH HER.
[CHEERING] WE ARE WITH HER BECAUSE SHE IS
WITH US. AND THAT IS WHY WE'RE GOING TO
SEND HILLARY CLINTON TO THE WHITE HOUSE THIS  NOVEMBER.
[CHEERING] THANK YOU.
