<strong>Jill Biden</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> PLEASE WELCOME DR. JILL
BIDEN.
(music)
[CHEERS]
>> THANK YOU.
[CHEERS] IT IS GREAT TO BE BACK IN PHILLY.
[CHEERS] ONCE AGAIN, WE ARE MAKING
HISTORY.<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> TOGETHER, WE WILL ELECT THE FIRST WOMAN PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON.
[CHEERS] LET ME START BY THANKING YOU FOR
LONG DESERVE AS SECOND LADY OF
THE UNITED STATES FOR THE PAST
EIGHT YEARS.
[CHEERS] IT HAS BEEN AN HONOR. AND LET ME THANK YOU FOR THE LOVE AND SUPPORT YOU HAVE GIVEN OUR FAMILY.
IT HAS MEANT THOUGH WORLD TO US.
-- THE WORLD TO US.
OVER THE PAST EIGHT YEARS,
AMERICA HAS GOTTEN TO KNOW THE JOE BIDEN THAT I KNOW AND LOVE. HE IS HONEST AND STRONG,
PRINCIPLED AND COMPASSIONATE, HE WAS AUTHENTIC LONG BEFORE IT
BECAME A BUZZWORD IN POLITICS.
HE UNDERSTANDS THAT WORKING PEOPLE ARE THE BACKBONE OF THIS
GREAT NATION. AND HE HAS TREMENDOUS EMPATHY
FOR THOSE IN NEED. HE KNOWS, AS I DO, THAT EDUCATION IS THE GREAT EQUALIZER
AND THAT COMMUNITY COLLEGES ARE
AMERICA'S BEST-KEPT SECRET. AND HE BELIEVES, AS I DO, THAT WE HAVE A SPECIAL OBLIGATION TO
OUR MILITARY AND THEIR FAMILIES. HE HAS A DEEP COMMITMENT TO
JUSTICE AND HE HAS BEEN HIS ENTIRE CAREER STANDING UP TO THE
ABUSE OF POWER. HE KNOWS AT ITS BEST, POLITICS IS ALWAYS A MATTER OF THE HEART. AND HE REMAINS TODAY EVEN AFTER ALL HE HAS BEEN THERE -- THROUGH, THE MOST OPTIMISTIC
PERSON I KNOW.
[CHEERS] HE LOVES HIS FAMILY, HE LOVES THIS COUNTRY, HE IS YOUR VICE PRESIDENT AND MY HUSBAND, JOE BIDEN.
[CHEERS]
