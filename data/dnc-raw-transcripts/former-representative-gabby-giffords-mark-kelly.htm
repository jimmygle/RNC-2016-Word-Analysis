<strong>Mark E. Kelly</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> THANK YOU. AND YOU, EVERYONE.
[CHEERS] IT IS SO GREAT TO BE HERE IN THE
GREAT CITY OF PHILADELPHIA. I SPEAK YOU TONIGHT AS A PROUD SON OF TWO NEW JERSEY<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> POLICE
OFFICERS.
[CHEERS] AS A VETERAN OF 39, MISSIONS DURING OPERATION DESERT STORM, AND OF 25 YEARS IN THE UNITED STATES NAVY --
[CHEERS] AS A FORMER NASA ASTRONAUT WHO
FLEW FOR MISSIONS INTO SPACE, MY DECADES AS A PILOT A MILITARY
OFFICER AND ASTRONAUT GAVE ME A UNIQUE PERSPECTIVE ON OUR WORLD. I SAW OUR COUNTRY AT ITS BEST.
I ALSO SAW IT, HUMANITY, AT ITS WORST.
FROM THE COCKPIT OF MY BASICS INTRUDER -- A-6 INTRUDER, I SAW
AMERICA LEAD THE INTERNATIONAL COALITION THAT DEFEATED SADDAM
HUSSEIN. I ALSO SAW THE DEVASTATING
EFFECTS OF WAR ITSELF. FROM ORBIT, I SAW OUR PLANET AS A PERFECT BLUE MARBLE JUST LOADING IN THE BLACKNESS OF
SPACE.
-- FLOATING IN THE BLACKNESS OF
SPACE. I ALSO SAW A RECEDING GLACIERS AND SHRINKING RAINFORESTS.
AT WAR AND SPACE, I SAW THE AWESOME EXTENT OF AMERICAN POWER
AND CAPABILITY. BUT IT WAS SO FRUSTRATING TO RETURN HOME AND SEE HOW WE STRUGGLE TO ADDRESS SOME OF OUR GREATEST CHALLENGES. JUST AS HILLARY IS PREPARED TO DO THE ISIS, ADVANCE OUR VALUES, AND PROTECT OUR FREEDOMS, HILLARY IS READY TO TAKE ON ONE
OF OUR COUNTRIES GREATEST MORAL FAILURES HERE AT HOME, AND THAT IS THE GUN VIOLENCE THAT IS TEARING SO MANY OF OUR
COMMUNITIES APART.
[CHEERS] WE HAVE TO DO BETTER. AND HILLARY KNOWS WE CAN. HILLARY KNOWS THAT WE CAN SAVE
LIVES BY DOING MORE TO KEEP GUNS
OUT OF THE WRONG HANDS. AND WE KNOW THAT AS PRESIDENT,
SHE WILL DO WHAT IS RIGHT FOR OUR NATION, NOT WHAT IS
POLITICALLY CORRECT -- POLITICALLY EXPEDIENT.
[CHEERS] SHE WAS DEAD UP TO THE
WASHINGTON GUN LOBBY THAT WORKS TO PROTECT THE SHAMEFUL STATUS QUO. IF WE WANT TO LEAVE OUR KIDS AND
GRANDKIDS A COUNTRY WITH LESS GUN VIOLENCE, NOT MORE, THEN WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT HILLARY
CLINTON IS OUR NEXT PRESIDENT.
[CHEERS] NOW, I WANT TO INTRODUCE YOU TO SOMEBODY WHO IS WORKING TO DO
JUST THAT.
SOMEBODY WHO HAS TAUGHT ME EACH
AND EVERY DAY TO DENY THEY
SENTENCE OF FAILURE, SOMEBODY
WHO DOES NOT GIVE UP AND
SOMEBODY WHO BELIEVES, LIKE HILLARY DOES THAT WE ARE STRONGER TOGETHER. MY WIFE, MY WIFE THE AWESOME CONGRESSWOMAN DEBBIE GIFFORDS.
-- GABBY GIFFORDS.
[CHEERS]

<strong>Gabrielle Giffords</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> HELLO FELLOW DEMOCRATS!
[CHEERS] WHAT A CROWD.
[CHEERS] I'M HONORED TO BE HERE TODAY. WE HAVE IMPORTANT WORK AHEAD OF
US. WORK THAT WILL DETERMINE<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> THE
FUTURE OF OUR COUNTRY.
ARE YOU READY?
[CHEERS] ARE YOU READY?
[CHEERS] ARE YOU READY?
[CHEERS] I'M READY. IN CONGRESS I LEARNED A POWERFUL LESSON. STRONG WOMEN GET THINGS DONE.
[CHEERS] HILLARY IS TOUGH. HILLARY IS COURAGEOUS. SHE WILL FIGHT TO MAKE OUR FAMILIES SAFER. IN THE WHITE HOUSE, SHE WILL
STAND UP TO THE GUN LOBBY, THAT
IS WHY I AM VOTING FOR HILLARY.
[CHEERS] COME JANUARY, I WANT TO SAY THESE TWO WORDS, MADAM
PRESIDENT.
[CHEERS] THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
