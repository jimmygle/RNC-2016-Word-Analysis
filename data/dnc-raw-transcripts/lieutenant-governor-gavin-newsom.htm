<strong>Gavin Newsom</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> SOME"
-- NEWSOM: I'M A PROUD DEMOCRAT FROM THE GREAT STATE OF
CALIFORNIA.
[CHEERS] I AM PROUD BECAUSE TODAY'S CALIFORNIA, TODAY'S CALIFORNIA
IS STRONG<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> AND GETTING STRONGER. THE JET PROPELLED ENGINE OF JOB CREATION, HOME QUARTER
CREATIVITY AROUND THE WORLD.
WE HAVE DONE IT NOT JUST THROUGH INNOVATION, BUT WE HAVE DONE IT
THROUGH INCLUSION.
WE ARE PRO-IMMIGRANT, PROENVIRONMENT, PRO-WOMEN, PRO-WORKERS, AND PROBABLY
PRO-GAY, LESBIANS, BISEXUALS AND TRANSGENDER.
[APPLAUSE] WE ARE NOT THE GOLDEN STATE
DESPITE OUR VALUES. WE ARE THE GOLDEN STATE BECAUSE
OF THEM.
AT OUR BEST WE DON'T TOLERATE OUR DIVERSITY.
AT OUR BEST WE CELEBRATE IT. THOSE VALUES OF LIBERTY, DIVERSITY, AND OPPORTUNITY. THOSE ARE FUNDAMENTALLY AMERICAN
VALUES. THOSE VALUES ARE UNDER ATTACK
NOT JUST BY ENEMIES ABROAD, BUT
BY A GOP THAT HAS MOVED ITS FEAR
MONGERING FRENCH TO CENTER STAGE
-- FRINGE TO CENTER STAGE. WHAT DONALD TRUMP PRESENTED LAST WEEK WAS NOT POLITICAL
DISCOURSE. IT WASN'T EVEN CLINICAL
INCORRECTNESS. WHAT TRUMP PRESENTED WITH THE FETUS AND -- DEFEATIST AND RETREATIST. NEVER HAS A SPEECH BEEN SO LONG
WAS SO LITTLE SUBSTANCE, SCIENCE, HUMANITY, HUMOR OR SO
LITTLE HOPE. HIS HOSTILE TAKEOVER OF THE AMERICAN DREAM IS BUILT ON TWO
FUNDAMENTAL LIES. THAT AMERICA IS A DARK AND
DESPERATE PLACE, AND THAT HE HAS
THE KIND OF PLAN TO MAKE IT
BETTER. TRUMP STRANGLED US, THE SUNNY OPTIMISM OF RONALD REAGAN AND REPLACED "TEAR DOWN THAT WALL" WITH THE BIGOTRY OF "BILL THAT
WILL." MALICE TOWARDS DIFFERENT VIEWS AND DIFFERENT HUES. THOSE ARE DISQUALIFICATIONS FROM
ANY OFFICE, LET ALONE THE
HIGHEST OFFICE IN THE LAND.
[APPLAUSE] AND DEMOCRATS, WHILE IT WAS REFRESHING TO FINALLY SEE AN
OPENLY GAY MAN SPEAK AT A REPUBLICAN CONVENTION, IT DOES NOT REMOVE THE STAIN OF
SELECTING MIKE PENCE, AMERICA'S
MOST ANTI-LGBT GOVERNOR.
[APPLAUSE] PENCE SUPPORTED OVERT
DISCRIMINATION. HE ADVOCATED FOR DIVERTING TAXPAYER DOLLARS TO SO-CALLED
CONVERSION THERAPY. MAKE NO MISTAKE. CONVERSION THERAPY IS NOT ABOUT
PRAYING A WAY TO GET A.
-- AWAY THE GAY. IT'S A TORTURE AGAINST OUR MOST INNOCENT CITIZENS, OUR CHILDREN. TELLING THEM THAT TO LIVE THEY MUST APPLY -- LIE ABOUT WHO THEY
ARE AND WHO THEY LOVE. THAT IS FUNDAMENTALLY
UN-AMERICAN. THE AGE-OLD CHOICE HAS NEVER BEEN MORE CLEAR. WE CAN LIVE OUR FEARS, ALL WE
CAN LIVE OUR DREAMS. HILLARY CLINTON IS DEDICATED HER
ENTIRE LIFE TO PUTTING THE
AMERICAN DREAM WITHIN REACH. SHE BELIEVES IN DIVERSITY OVER DIVISION. THE HARD WORK OF PLURALISM OVER THE ILLUSION OF DIFFERENCES AND AS A FATHER OF FOUR I WANT
TO SAY THIS. I WANT TO SAY SOMETHING TO ALL
THE CHILDREN WHO WERE WATCHING,
ALL THE CHILDREN THAT ARE LISTENING AT HOME. WHEN YOU HEAR PEOPLE SAY THAT YOU AND YOUR FAMILY DON'T MATTER
BECAUSE OF WHO YOU ARE OR WHERE YOU COME FROM OR WHAT YOU LOOK
LIKE OR YOU LOVE, I WANT YOU TO
KNOW ONE THING. THE PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM, THE PEOPLE ALL ACROSS THIS COUNTRY BELIEVE YOU MATTER. HILLARY CLINTON BELIEVES YOU
MATTER. WE BELIEVE THAT YOU BELONG HERE. WE NEED YOU HERE. WE BELIEVE YOU CAN BE WHOEVER YOU ARE AND BECOME WHATEVER YOU
WANT TO BE. WE WILL FIGHT FOR YOU.
WE WILL FIGHT FOR YOU NOT JUST OVER THE NEXT 100 DAYS, BUT OVER
THE NEXT 100 YEARS. NO MATTER HOW -- WHAT PEOPLE TELL YOU, THAT IS WHAT AMERICA
IS ALL ABOUT. THAT IS WHAT MAKES AMERICA GREAT.
[CHEERS]. THANK YOU.</span><span class='hidden-full-transcript-ellipses'>...</span></p><a href='#' class='hidden-full-transcript-link'><i class='icon-chevron-down'></i> <span class='link-show-full-text'>Show Full Text</span><i class='icon-chevron-up'></i> <span class='link-show-less-text'>Show Less Text</span></a>
