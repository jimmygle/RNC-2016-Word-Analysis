<strong>MRS. CLINTON</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> HILLARY!
MRS. CLINTON: THAT CONVERSATION HAS LASTED THROUGH GOOD TIMES
THAT TOLD US WITH JOY -- FILLED US WITH JOY AND HARD TIMES THAT TESTED US AND I<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> EVEN GOT IN A
FEW WORDS AND ALONG THE WAY -- IN ALONG THE WAY.
[CHEERS] ON TUESDAY NIGHT I WAS SO HAPPY TO SEE THAT MY EXPLAINER IN
CHIEF IS STILL ON THE JOB. I'M ALSO GRATEFUL TO THE REST OF MY FAMILY AND TO THE FRIENDS OF A LIFETIME, FOR ALL OF YOU,
WHOSE HARD WORK BROUGHT US TONIGHT TOGETHER, AND TO THOSE OF YOU WHO JOINED THIS CAMPAIGN THIS WEEK, THANK YOU. WHAT A REMARKABLE WEEK IT HAS
BEEN.
[CHEERS] WE HEARD THE MAN FROM HOPE, BILL CLINTON, AND THE MAN OF HOPE,
BARACK OBAMA.
[CHEERS] AMERICA IS STRONGER BECAUSE OF
PRESIDENT OBAMA'S LEADERSHIP AND
THAT BETTER BECAUSE OF HIS
FRIENDSHIP.
-- I AM BETTER BECAUSE OF HIS
FRIENDSHIP.
[CHEERS] WE HEARD FROM OUR TERRIFIC VICE PRESIDENT, THE ONE AND ONLY JOE
BIDEN.
[CHEERS] HE SPOKE FROM HIS BIG HEART
ABOUT OUR COMMITTEES -- PARTIES
COMMITMENT TO WORKING PEOPLE. AND FIRST LADY MICHELLE OBAMA REMINDED US --
[CHEERS] THAT OUR CHILDREN ARE WATCHING. AND THE PRESIDENT WE ELECT IS
GOING TO BE THEIR PRESIDENT, TOO
. AND FOR THOSE OF YOU OUT THERE
WHO ARE JUST GETTING TO KNOW TIM KAINE.
[CHEERS] YOU WILL SOON UNDERSTAND WHY THE
PEOPLE OF VIRGINIA KEEP PROMOTING HIM FROM CITY COUNCIL TO MAYOR, TO GOVERNOR AND NOW
SENATOR AND HE WILL MAKE OUR
WHOLE COUNTRY PROUD AS OUR NEXT
VICE PRESIDENT.
[CHEERS] AND I WANT TO THANK BERNIE SANDERS.
[CHEERS] BERNIE, YOUR CAMPAIGN INSPIRED MILLIONS OF AMERICANS, PARTICULARLY THE YOUNG PEOPLE WHO DO THEIR HEARTS AND SOULS INTO OUR PRIMARY.
[CHEERS] YOU PUT ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL
JUSTICE ISSUES BROUGHT AND
CENTER WHERE THEY BELONG.
[CHEERS] AND TO ALL OF YOUR SUPPORTERS
HERE AND AROUND THE COUNTRY, I
WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT I'VE HEARD
YOU, YOUR CAUSE IS OUR CAUSE.
[CHEERS] OUR COUNTRY NEEDS YOUR IDEAS,
ENERGY AND PASSION. THAT IS THE ONLY WAY WE CAN TURN
OUR PROGRESSIVE PLATFORM INTO
REAL CHANGE FOR AMERICA.
[CHEERS] WE WROTE TO TOGETHER, NOW LET'S
GO OUT AND MAKE IT HAPPEN
TOGETHER.
[CHEERS] MY FRIENDS, WE HAVE COME TO PHILADELPHIA, THE BIRTHPLACE OF
OUR NATION BECAUSE WHAT HAPPENED IN THE CITY 200 AND 40 YEARS AGO
STILL HAS SOMETHING TO TEACH US
TODAY. WE ALL KNOW THE STORY, BUT WE
USUALLY FOCUS ON HOW IT TURNED OUT AND NOT ENOUGH ON HOW CLOSE THAT STORY CAME TO NEVER BEING
WRITTEN AT ALL. WHEN REPRESENTATIVES FROM 13 UNRULY COLONIES MET JUST DOWN
THE ROAD FROM HERE, SOME WANTED
TO STICK WITH THE KING AND SOMEBODY WENT TO STICK IT TO THE
KING. THE REVOLUTION HUNG IN THE
BALANCE. THEN SOMEHOW THEY BEGAN LISTENING TO EACH OTHER. COMPROMISING. FINDING COMMON PURPOSE.
[CHEERS] AND BY THE TIME THEY LEFT PHILADELPHIA, THEY HAD BEGUN TO
SEE THEMSELVES AS ONE NATION. THAT IS WHAT MADE IT POSSIBLE TO
STAND UP TO A KING, THAT THE COURAGE, THEY HAD COURAGE. OUR FOUNDERS EMBRACED THE
ENDURING TRUTH THAT WE ARE STRONGER TOGETHER.
[CHEERS] NOW AMERICA IS ONCE AGAIN AT A
MOMENT OF RECKONING. POWERFUL FORCES ARE THREATENING TO PULL US APART. BONDS OF TRUST AND RESPECT ARE FRAMED.
-- FRAYING.
AND JUST AS WITH OUR FOUNDERS,
THERE ARE NO GUARANTEES. IT TRULY IS UP TO US. WE HAVE TO DECIDE WHETHER WE WILL ALL WORK TOGETHER SO WE CAN ALL REST TOGETHER.
-- RISE TOGETHER.
[CHEERS] OUR COUNTRY'S MOTHER IS E PLURIBUS UNUM. OUT OF MANY, WE ARE ONE. WILL BE STAGER TO THAT MOTTO -- WILL WE BE TRUE TO THAT MOTTO?
[CHEERS] WE HEARD DONALD COMES ANSWER. HE WAS TO DIVIDE US FROM THE REST OF THE WORLD AND FROM EACH OTHER. HE IS BETTING THAT THE PERILS OF TODAY'S WORLD WILL BLIND US TO
ITS UNLIMITED PROMISE. HE IS TAKEN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY
A LONG WAY FROM MOURNING IN
AMERICA TO MIDNIGHT IN AMERICA. HE WANTS US TO FEAR THE FUTURE
AND FEAR EACH OTHER. WELL YOU KNOW, A GREAT DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENT, FRANK
WITHOUT A ROOSEVELT CAME UP WITH THE PERFECT REBUKE TO DRUM. MORE THAN 80 YEARS AGO, DURING A MUCH MORE PERILOUS TIME, THE
ONLY THING WE HAVE TO FEAR IS. SELF -- FEAR ITSELF.
[CHEERS] NOW, WE ARE CLEARED -- CLEAR
EYED ABOUT WHAT OUR COUNTRY IS
UP AGAINST.
BUT WE ARE NOT AFRAID. WE WILL RISE TO THE CHALLENGE JUST AS WE ALWAYS HAVE. WE WILL NOT BUILD A WALL,
INSTEAD, WE WILL BUILD AN
ECONOMY WHERE EVERYONE WHO WANTS
A GOOD JOB CAN GET ONE.
[CHEERS] AND WE WILL BUILD A PATH TO CITIZENSHIP FOR MILLIONS OF
IMMIGRANTS WHO ARE ALREADY CONTRIBUTING TO OUR ECONOMY.
[CHEERS] WE WILL NOT BEEN A RELIGION, WE
WILL WORK WITH ALL AMERICANS AND
OUR ALLIES TO FIGHT AND IF THE
TERRORISM.
-- DEFEAT TERRORISM.
[CHEERS] YET WE KNOW THERE IS A LOT TO
DO. TOO MANY PEOPLE HAVE NOT HAD A PAY RAISE SINCE THE CRASH. THERE IS TOO MUCH INEQUALITY, TOO LITTLE SOCIAL MOBILITY, TOO MUCH FOR ALICE'S IN WASHINGTON. TOO MANY -- PARALYSIS IN
WASHINGTON. TOO MANY THREATS AT HOME AND
ABROAD. JUST LOOK FOR A MINUTE AT THE
STRENGTH WE BRING AS AMERICANS
TO MEET THESE CHALLENGES.
WE HAVE THE MOST DYNAMIC INTO
FIRST PEOPLE IN THE WORLD.
[CHEERS] WE HAVE THE MOST TOLERANT AND
GENEROUS YOUNG PEOPLE WE'VE EVER HAD.
[CHEERS] WE HAVE THE MOST POWERFUL MILITARY, THE MOST INNOVATIVE ENTREPRENEURS, THE MOST ENDURING
VALUES. FREEDOM AND EQUALITY, JUSTICE
AND OPPORTUNITY. WE SHOULD BE SO PROUD THAT THOSE
WORDS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH US. I HAVE TO TELL YOU, AS YOUR SECRETARY OF STATE, I WENT TO 112 COUNTRIES. WHEN PEOPLE HEAR THOSE WORDS,
THEY HEAR AMERICA.
[CHEERS] DON'T LET ANYONE TELL YOU THAT
OUR COUNTRY IS WEEK, WE ARE NOT. DON'T LET ANYONE TELL YOU WE DON'T HAVE WHAT IT TAKES, WE DO. AND MOST OF ALL, DON'T BELIEVE ANYONE WHO SAYS I ALONE CAN FIX
IT.
[CHEERS] THOSE WERE ACTUALLY DONALD TRUMP'S WORDS IN CLEVELAND. THEY SHOULD SET OFF ALARM BELLS FOR ALL OF US. REALLY? I ALONE CAN FIX IT. ISN'T HE FORGETTING TROOPS ON
THE FRONT LINES, POLICE OFFICERS AND FIREFIGHTERS WHO RUN TOWARDS
DANGER, DOCTORS AND NURSES WHO
CARE FOR US, TEACHERS WHO CHANGE LIVES, ENTREPRENEURS WHO SEE
POSSIBILITIES IN EVERY PROBLEM,
MOTHERS WHO LOST CHILDREN TO VIOLENCE, AND ARE BUILDING A
MOVEMENT TO KEEP OTHER KIDS
SAFE, HE IS FORGETTING EVERY
LAST ONE OF US. AMERICANS DON'T SAY I ALONE CAN FIX IT, WE SAY WILL FIX IT
TOGETHER.
[CHEERS] AND REMEMBER, OUR FOUNDERS
THOUGHT THE REVOLUTION -- FOUGHT
A REVOLUTION AND WROTE THE
CONSTITUTION SO AMERICA WOULD
NEVER BE A NATION WHERE ONE
PERSON HAD ALL THE POWER.
[CHEERS] 240 YEARS LATER, WE STILL PUT OUR FAITH IN EACH OTHER. LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED IN DALLAS. AFTER THE ASSASSINATIONS OF FIVE
BRAVE POLICE OFFICER'S, POLICE CHIEF DAVE BROWN ASKED THE
COMMUNITY TO SUPPORT HIS FORCE,
MAYBE EVEN JOINED THEM. AND YOU HAVE THE COMMUNITY RESPONDED? NEARLY 500 PEOPLE APPLIED IN
JUST 12 DAYS.
[CHEERS] THAT IS HOW AMERICANS ANSWER WHEN THE CALL FOR HELP GOES OUT. 20 YEARS AGO, I WROTE A BOOK
CALLED IT TAKES A VILLAGE.
[CHEERS] AND A LOT OF PEOPLE LOOK AT THE
TITLE AND ASKED, WHAT THE HECK
DO YOU MEAN BY THAT? THIS IS WHAT I MEAN. NONE OF US CAN RIVET FAMILY, BUILD A BUSINESS, HEALEY
COMMUNITY, OR LIFT A COUNTRY TOTALLY ALONE.
[CHEERS] AMERICA NEEDS EVERYONE OF US TO LEND OUR ENERGY, OUR TALENT, OUR AMBITION TO MAKING OUR NATION BETTER AND STRONGER. I BELIEVE THAT WITH ALL OF MY
HEART. THAT IS WHY STRONGER TOGETHER IS
NOT JUST A LESSON FROM OUR HISTORY, IT IS NOT JUST A SLOGAN
FOR OUR CAMPAIGN, IT IS A GUIDING PRINCIPLE FOR THE
COUNTRY WE'VE ALWAYS BEEN IN THE
FUTURE WE ARE GOING TO BUILD. A COUNTRY WHERE THE ECONOMY IS FOR EVERYONE, NOT JUST THOSE AT THE TOP. WHERE YOU CAN GET A GOOD JOB AND
SEND YOUR KIDS TO A GOOD SCHOOL
NO MATTER WHAT ZIP CODE YOU LIVE
IN. A COUNTRY WHERE ALL OUR CHILDREN CAN TEAM -- DREAM AND THE DREAMS ARE IN REACH. WHERE FAMILIES ARE STRONG AND
COMMUNITIES ARE SAFE AND YES,
, LOVE TRUMPS HATE.
[CHEERS] THAT IS THE COUNTRY WE ARE
FIGHTING FOR. THAT'S THE FUTURE WE ARE WORKING
TOWARD. AND SO, MY FRIENDS, IT IS WITH HUMILITY, DETERMINATION, AND
BOUNDLESS CONFIDENCE IN AMERICA'S PROMISE THAT I ACCEPT
YOUR NOMINATION FOR PRESIDENT OF
THE UNITED
STATES.
[CHEERS] NOW, SOMETIMES THE PEOPLE AT THIS PODIUM ARE NEW TO THE NATIONAL STAGE. AS YOU KNOW, I'M NOT ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE. I'VE BEEN YOUR FIRST LADY. SERVED 8 YEARS AS A SENATOR FROM THE GREAT STATE OF NEW YORK.
[CHEERS] THEN I REPRESENTED ALL OF YOU AS
SECRETARY OF STATE. BUT MY JOB TITLES ONLY TELL YOU
WHAT I'VE DONE.
THEY DON'T TELL YOU WHY.
THE TRUTH IS, THROUGH ALL THESE
YEARS OF PUBLIC SERVICE, THE
"SERVICE" PART HAS ALWAYS COME
EASIER TO ME THAN THE "PUBLIC" PART. I GET IT THAT SOME PEOPLE JUST
DON'T KNOW WHAT TO MAKE OF ME.
SO LET ME TELL YOU. THE FAMILY I'M FROM, NO ONE HAS THE NAMES ON BIG BUILDINGS.
MY FAMILY WERE BUILDERS OF A DIFFERENT KIND. BUILDERS IN THE WAY MOST AMERICAN FAMILIES ARE.
THEY USED WHATEVER TOOLS THEY HAD, WHATEVER GOD GAVE THEM AND
, WHATEVER LIFE IN AMERICA PROVIDED AND BUILD BETTER LIVES
AND BETTER FUTURES FOR THEIR
KIDS.
MY GRANDFATHER WORKED IN THE
SAME SCRANTON LACE MILL FOR 50 YEARS.
[CHEERS] BECAUSE HE BELIEVED THAT IF HE
GAVE EVERYTHING HE HAD, HIS
CHILDREN WOULD HAVE A BETTER
LIFE THAN HE DID.
AND HE WAS RIGHT.
MY DAD, HUGH, MADE IT TO COLLEGE.
HE PLAYED FOOTBALL AT PENN STATE AND ENLISTED IN THE NAVY AFTER PEARL HARBOR. WHEN THE WAR WAS OVER HE STARTED HIS OWN SMALL BUSINESS, PRINTING FABRIC FOR DRAPERIES.
I REMEMBER WATCHING HIM STAND
FOR HOURS OVER SILK SCREENS.
HE WANTED TO GIVE MY BROTHERS
AND ME OPPORTUNITIES HE NEVER HAD.
AND HE DID. MY MOTHER, DOROTHY, WAS ABANDONED BY HER PARENTS AS A
YOUNG GIRL. SHE ENDED UP ON HER OWN AT 14,
WORKING AS A HOUSE MAID.
SHE WAS SAVED BY THE KINDNESS OF
OTHERS. HER FIRST GRADE TEACHER SAW SHE HAD NOTHING TO EAT AT LUNCH, AND
BROUGHT EXTRA FOOD TO SHARE.
THE ENTIRE YEAR. THE LESSON SHE PASSED ON TO ME YEARS LATER STUCK WITH</span><span class='hidden-full-transcript-ellipses'>...</span></p><a href='#' class='hidden-full-transcript-link'><i class='icon-chevron-down'></i> <span class='link-show-full-text'>Show Full Text</span><i class='icon-chevron-up'></i> <span class='link-show-less-text'>Show Less Text</span></a>

<strong>WORDS OF OUR METHODIST FAITH</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> WORDS OF OUR METHODIST FAITH:
"DO ALL THE GOOD YOU CAN, FOR
ALL THE PEOPLE YOU CAN, IN ALL
THE WAYS YOU CAN, AS LONG AS
EVER YOU CAN."
[CHEERS] I WENT<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> TO WORK FOR THE
CHILDREN'S DEFENSE FUND, GOING
DOOR-TO-DOOR IN NEW BEDFORD, MASSACHUSETTS --
[CHEERS] ON BEHALF OF CHILDREN WITH
DISABILITIES WHO WERE DENIED THE CHANCE
TO GO TO SCHOOL.
I REMEMBER MEETING A YOUNG GIRL
IN A WHEELCHAIR ON THE SMALL
BACK PORCH OF HER HOUSE. SHE TOLD ME HOW BADLY SHE WANTED TO GO TO SCHOOL, IT JUST DIDN'T SEEM POSSIBLE. AND I COULDN'T STOP THINKING OF
MY MOTHER AND WHAT SHE WENT THROUGH AS A CHILD. IT BECAME CLEAR TO ME THAT SIMPLY CARING IS NOT ENOUGH. TO DRIVE REAL PROGRESS, YOU HAVE TO CHANGE BOTH HEARTS AND LAWS.
YOU NEED BOTH UNDERSTANDING AND ACTION.
[CHEERS] SO WE GATHERED FACTS. WE BUILT A
COALITION. AND OUR WORK HELPED CONVINCE
CONGRESS TO ENSURE ACCESS TO
EDUCATION FOR ALL STUDENTS WITH
DISABILITIES. IT'S A BIG IDEA, ISN'T IT? EVERY KID WITH A DISABILITY HAS
THE RIGHT TO GO TO SCHOOL.
[CHEERS] BUT HOW DO YOU MAKE AN IDEA LIKE
THAT REAL? YOU DO IT YOU DO IT STEP BY STEP, HEREBY
BY YEAR, SOMETIMES EVEN
DOOR-TO-DOOR. AND MY HEART JUST SWELLED WHEN I SAW ANASTASIA SOMOZA ON THIS
STAGE REPRESENTING MILLIONS OF
YOUNG PEOPLE. WE CHANGED OUR LOT TO MAKE SURE
SHE GOT AN EDUCATION.
IT IS TRUE.
I SWEAT THE DETAILS OF POLICY
WHETHER WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE
EXACT LEVEL OF LEAD IN THE
DRINKING WATER IN FLINT,
MICHIGAN, THE NUMBER OF MENTAL
HEALTH FACILITIES IN IOWA, OR
THE COST OF YOUR PRESCRIPTION DRUGS.
BECAUSE IT'S NOT JUST A DETAIL
IF IT'S YOUR KID, IF IT'S YOUR
FAMILY.
IT'S A BIG DEAL.
AND IT SHOULD BE A BIG DEAL TO
YOUR PRESIDENT.
[CHEERS] AFTER THE FOUR DAYS OF THIS
CONVENTION, YOU'VE SEEN SOME OF
THE PEOPLE WHO'VE INSPIRED ME.
PEOPLE WHO LET ME INTO THEIR
LIVES, AND BECAME A PART OF MINE.
PEOPLE LIKE RYAN MOORE AND
LAUREN MANNING. THEY TOLD THEIR STORIES TUESDAY NIGHT.
I FIRST MET RYAN AS A SEVEN-YEAR OLD. HE WAS WEARING A FULL BODY BRACE THAT MUST HAVE WEIGHED FORTY POUNDS. BECAUSE I LEANED OVER TO LIFT HIM UP.
CHILDREN LIKE RYAN KEPT ME GOING
WHEN OUR PLAN FOR UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE FAILED AND KEPT ME
WORKING WITH LEADERS OF BOTH
PARTIES TO HELP CREATE THE
CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE
PROGRAM THAT COVERS 8 MILLION
KIDS IN OUR COUNTRY.
[CHEERS] LAUREN MANNING, WHO SAID HERE -- DID HERE WITH SUCH GRACE AND
POWER WAS GRAVELY INJURED ON
9/11.
IT WAS THE THOUGHT OF HER, AND
DEBBIE ST. JOHN, AND JOHN DOLAN
AND JOE SWEENEY, AND ALL THE
VICTIMS AND SURVIVORS, THAT KEPT
ME WORKING AS HARD AS I COULD IN
THE SENATE ON BEHALF OF 9/11
FAMILIES, AND OUR FIRST
RESPONDERS WHO GOT SICK FROM
THEIR TIME AT GROUND ZERO.
I WAS THINKING OF LAUREN, DEBBIE AND ALL THE OTHERS TEN YEARS LATER IN THE WHITE HOUSE
SITUATION ROOM WHEN PRESIDENT
OBAMA MADE THE COURAGEOUS
DECISION THAT FINALLY BROUGHT
OSAMA BIN LADEN TO JUSTICE.
[CHEERS] IN THIS CAMPAIGN, I'VE MET SO
MANY PEOPLE WHO MOTIVATE ME TO
KEEP FIGHTING FOR CHANGE. AND, WITH YOUR HELP, I WILL
CARRY ALL OF YOUR VOICES AND
STORIES WITH ME TO THE WHITE HOUSE.
[CHEERS] AND YOU HEARD FROM REPUBLICANS AND INDEPENDENTS WERE SUPPORTING
OUR CAMPAIGN, WELL I WILL BE A PRESIDENT FOR DEMOCRATS, REPUBLICANS, INDEPENDENTS.
FOR THE STRUGGLING, THE STRIVING
AND THE SUCCESSFUL.
FOR THOSE WHO VOTE FOR ME AND THOSE WHO DON'T. FOR ALL AMERICANS.
[CHEERS] TOGETHER!

TOWARD A MORE PERFECT</span><span class='hidden-full-transcript-ellipses'>...</span></p><a href='#' class='hidden-full-transcript-link'><i class='icon-chevron-down'></i> <span class='link-show-full-text'>Show Full Text</span><i class='icon-chevron-up'></i> <span class='link-show-less-text'>Show Less Text</span></a>

<strong>UNION
THE</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> UNION:
THE FIRST TIME THAT A MAJOR
PARTY HAS NOMINATED A WOMAN FOR PRESIDENT.
[CHEERS] STANDING HERE AS MY MOTHER'S
DAUGHTER, AND MY DAUGHTER'S
MOTHER,<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> I'M SO HAPPY THIS DAY
HAS COME.
HAPPY FOR GRANDMOTHERS AND
LITTLE GIRLS AND EVERYONE IN BETWEEN. I'M HAPPY FOR BOYS AND MEN
BECAUSE WHEN ANY BARRIER FALLS IN AMERICA, FOR ANYONE, IT
CLEARS THE WAY FOR EVERYONE.
[CHEERS] AFTER ALL, WHEN THERE ARE NO
CEILINGS, THE SKY'S THE LIMIT.
[CHEERS] SO LET'S KEEP GOING, UNTIL EVERY
ONE OF THE 161 MILLION WOMEN AND
GIRLS ACROSS AMERICA HAS THE
OPPORTUNITY SHE DESERVES.
[CHEERS] BUT, EVEN MORE IMPORTANT THAN
THE HISTORY WE MAKE TONIGHT, IS
THE HISTORY WE WILL WRITE TOGETHER IN THE YEARS AHEAD. LET'S BEGIN WITH WHAT WE'RE
GOING TO DO TO HELP WORKING PEOPLE IN OUR COUNTRY GET AHEAD AND STAY AHEAD. NOW, I DON'T THINK PRESIDENT OBAMA AND VICE PRESIDENT BIDEN
GET THE CREDIT THEY DESERVE FOR SAVING US FROM THE WORST ECONOMIC CRISIS OF OUR LIFETIMES.
[CHEERS] OUR ECONOMY IS SO MUCH STRONGER
THAN WHEN THEY TOOK OFFICE.
NEARLY 15 MILLION NEW PRIVATE SECTOR JOBS. MILLION MORE AMERICANS WITH 20 HEALTH INSURANCE.
AND AN AUTO INDUSTRY THAT JUST
HAD ITS BEST YEAR EVER. THAT'S

[CHEERS] THAT IS REAL PROGRESS. BUT NONE OF US CAN BE SATISFIED
WITH THE STATUS QUO. NOT BY A LONG SHOT. WE'RE STILL FACING DEEP-SEATED
PROBLEMS THAT DEVELOPED LONG
BEFORE THE RECESSION AND HAVE
STAYED WITH US THROUGH THE RECOVERY.
I'VE GONE AROUND OUR COUNTRY
TALKING TO WORKING FAMILIES AND
I'VE HEARD FROM SO MANY OF YOU WHO FEEL LIKE THE ECONOMY JUST ISN'T WORKING. SOME OF YOU ARE FRUSTRATED, EVEN
FEAR IS.
YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU'RE RIGHT. IT'S NOT YET WORKING THE WAY IT
SHOULD. AMERICANS ARE WILLING TO WORK
AND WORK HARD BUT RIGHT NOW, AN
, AWFUL LOT OF PEOPLE FEEL THERE
IS LESS AND LESS RESPECT FOR THE
WORK THEY DO.
AND LESS RESPECT FOR THEM, PERIOD.
DEMOCRATS ARE THE PARTY OF
WORKING PEOPLE. BUT WE HAVEN'T DONE A GOOD ENOUGH JOB SHOWING THAT WE GET
WHAT YOU'RE GOING THROUGH,
AND THAT WE'RE GOING TO DO
SOMETHING TO HELP. SO I WANT TO TELL YOU TONIGHT
HOW WE WILL EMPOWER AMERICANS TO
LIVE BETTER LIVES.
MY PRIMARY MISSION AS PRESIDENT
WILL BE TO CREATE MORE
OPPORTUNITY AND MORE GOOD JOBS
WITH RISING WAGES RIGHT HERE IN THE UNITED STATES.
[CHEERS] FROM MY FIRST DAY IN OFFICE TO MY LAST, ESPECIALLY IN PLACES THAT FOR TOO LONG HAVE BEEN LEFT OUT AND LEFT BEHIND. FROM OUR INNER CITIES TO OUR
SMALL TOWNS, FROM INDIAN COUNTRY TO COAL COUNTRY.
[CHEERS] FROM COMMUNITIES RAVAGED BY ADDICTION TO REGIONS HOLLOWED OUT BY PLANT CLOSURES. AND HERE'S WHAT I BELIEVE. I BELIEVE AMERICA THRIVES WHEN THE MIDDLE CLASS THRIVES. I BELIEVE THAT OUR ECONOMY ISN'T WORKING THE WAY IT SHOULD BECAUSE OUR DEMOCRACY ISN'T WORKING THE WAY IT SHOULD.
[CHEERS] THAT'S WHY WE NEED TO APPOINT
SUPREME COURT JUSTICES WHO WILL
GET MONEY OUT OF POLITICS AND
EXPAND VOTING RIGHTS, NOT
RESTRICT THEM.
[CHEERS] AND IT IS NECESSARY, WE'LL PASS
A CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT TO
OVERTURN CITIZENS UNITED!
[CHEERS] I BELIEVE AMERICAN CORPORATIONS
THAT HAVE GOTTEN SO MUCH FROM
OUR COUNTRY SHOULD BE JUST AS
PATRIOTIC IN RETURN.
[CHEERS] MANY OF THEM ARE, BUT TOO MANY ART.
IT'S WRONG TO TAKE TAX BREAKS WITH ONE HAND AND GIVE OUT PINK
SLIPS WITH THE OTHER.
[CHEERS] AND I BELIEVE WALL STREET CAN
NEVER, EVER BE ALLOWED TO WRECK
MAIN STREET AGAIN.
[CHEERS] I BELIEVE IN SCIENCE. I BELIEVE

[CHEERS] I BELIEVE THAT CLIMATE CHANGE IS REAL AND THAT WE CAN SAVE OUR PLANET WHILE CREATING MILLIONS OF GOOD-PAYING CLEAN ENERGY JOBS. I BELIEVE THAT WHEN WE HAVE MILLIONS OF HARDWORKING IMMIGRANTS CONTRIBUTING TO OUR ECONOMY, IT WOULD BE SELF-DEFEATING AND INHUMANE TO
KICK THEM OUT.
[CHEERS] COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM
WILL GROW OUR ECONOMY AND KEEP FAMILIES TOGETHER AND IT'S THE
RIGHT THING TO DO.
[CHEERS] WHATEVER PARTY YOU BELONG TO, OR
IF YOU BELONG TO NO PARTY AT
ALL, IF YOU SHARE THESE BELIEFS,
THIS IS YOUR CAMPAIGN.
[CHEERS] IF YOU BELIEVE THAT COMPANIES
SHOULD SHARE PROFITS AND NOT PAD
EXECUTIVE BONUSES, JOIN US.
[CHEERS] IF YOU BELIEVE THE MINIMUM WAGE
SHOULD BE A LIVING WAGE AND NO ONE WORKING FULL TIME SHOULD
HAVE TO RAISE THEIR CHILDREN IN POVERTY, JOIN US.
[CHEERS] IF YOU BELIEVE THAT EVERY MAN, WOMAN, AND CHILD IN AMERICA HAS THE RIGHT TO AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE, JOIN US.
IF YOU BELIEVE THAT WE SHOULD
SAY "NO" TO UNFAIR TRADE DEALS, THAT WE SHOULD STAND UP TO CHINA, THAT WE SHOULD SUPPORT OUR STEELWORKERS AND AUTOWORKERS AND HOMEGROWN MANUFACTURERS,
THEN JOIN US.
[CHEERS] IF YOU BELIEVE WE SHOULD EXPAND SOCIAL SECURITY AND PROTECT A WOMAN'S RIGHT TO MAKE HER OWN HEALTH CARE DECISIONS, THEN JOIN
US.
[CHEERS] AND YES, IF YOU BELIEVE THAT YOU ARE WORKING MOTHER, WIFE,
SISTER, OR DAUGHTER DESERVES EQUAL PAY, JOIN US.
[CHEERS] THAT IS HOW WE'RE GOING TO MAKE SURE THIS ECONOMY WORKS FOR
EVERYONE, NOT JUST THOSE AT THE TOP. NOW, YOU DIDN'T HEAR ANY OF THIS
FROM DONALD TRUMP AT HIS CONVENTION.
HE SPOKE FOR 70-ODD MINUTES AND
I DO MEAN ODD.
[LAUGHTER] AND HE OFFERED ZERO SOLUTIONS.
BUT WE ALREADY KNOW HE DOESN'T
BELIEVE THESE THINGS. NO WONDER HE DOESN'T LIKE
TALKING ABOUT HIS PLANS.
YOU MIGHT HAVE NOTICED, I LOVE
TALKING ABOUT MINE.
[CHEERS] IN MY FIRST 100 DAYS, WE WILL WORK WITH BOTH PARTIES TO PASS THE BIGGEST INVESTMENT IN NEW, GOOD-PAYING JOBS SINCE WORLD WAR TWO.
[CHEERS] JOBS IN MANUFACTURING, CLEAN ENERGY, TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION, SMALL BUSINESS, AND INFRASTRUCTURE. IF WE INVEST IN INFRASTRUCTURE NOW, WE'LL NOT ONLY CREATE JOBS TODAY, BUT LAY THE FOUNDATION FOR THE JOBS OF THE FUTURE. AND WE WILL TRANSFORM THE WAY WE PREPARE OUR YOUNG PEOPLE FOR
THOSE JOBS.
BERNIE SANDERS AND I WILL WORK
TOGETHER TO MAKE COLLEGE TUITION FREE FOR THE MIDDLE
CLASS AND DEBT-FREE FOR ALL!
[CHEERS] WE WILL ALSO LIBERATE MILLIONS
OF PEOPLE WHO ALREADY HAVE
STUDENT DEBT.
[CHEERS] IT'S JUST NOT RIGHT THAT DONALD
TRUMP CAN IGNORE HIS DEBTS, BUT
STUDENTS AND FAMILIES CAN'T
REFINANCE THEIRS.
[CHEERS] AND HERE'S SOMETHING WE DON'T</span><span class='hidden-full-transcript-ellipses'>...</span></p><a href='#' class='hidden-full-transcript-link'><i class='icon-chevron-down'></i> <span class='link-show-full-text'>Show Full Text</span><i class='icon-chevron-up'></i> <span class='link-show-less-text'>Show Less Text</span></a>
