<p class='short_transcript'> >> FOUR MONTHS AGO, HILLARY
CLINTON SAT WITH ME IN A DONUT
SHOP IN OHIO. SHE ASKED IF YOU'RE MY STORY. I TOLD HER THAT MY HUSBAND AND I
WORKED THREE JOBS<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> JUST TO MAKE
ENDS MEET. BETWEEN US, WE WORK FOR 24 HOURS A DAY. WE ONLY SEE EACH OTHER WHEN THEY
PASS EACH OTHER IN THE DOORWAY. WHEN ONE OF US IS COMING HOME
AND THE OTHER IS LEAVING. I ONLY SEE MY KIDS WHEN THEY ARE
ONLY IN BED.
I GET HOME TOO LATE TO SPEND
QUALITY TIME WITH THEM. OUR LIFE IS CONSUMED BY WORKED
BUT WE ARE STILL CRUSHED BY
DEBT. MEDICAL, STUDENT LOANS, WE HAVE
NO SAVINGS.
WE WORK HARD AND YET IT FEELS
LIKE THE WORLD IS AGAINST US. I TOLD HILLARY CLINTON THAT EVEN
THOUGH EVERY DAY IS A STRUGGLE,
WE DON'T WANT A HANDOUT. WE WANT TO HAD TO HELP US UP. SHE UNDERSTOOD. SHE BELIEVED THAT AMERICA STRONGER WHEN WE LOOK OUT FOR
ONE ANOTHER. WHAT NO ONE WHO WORKS FULL-TIME
HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN MAKING A CAR MAY MEANT -- PAYMENT AND
SEEING CHILDREN.
THAT IS WHY I'M HERE TAKING TIME OFF FROM BOTH OF MY JOBS TO ASK
YOU TO PUT IN THE TIME TO ELECT HILLARY CLINTON AND HELP MAKE
LIFE BETTER FOR ME IN THE EYES OF PEOPLE JUST LIKE ME.
I BELIEVE WE CAN DO IT. AND I BELIEVE IN HILLARY
CLINTON.
THANK YOU.
