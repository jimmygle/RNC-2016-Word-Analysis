<strong>Bobby Scott</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> REP. SCOTT: MY FELLOW DEMOCRATS,
I FIRST MET TIM KAINE IT IS
AMAZING WIFE DURING HIS FIRST CAMPAIGN FOR CITY COUNCIL IN
RICHMOND, VIRGINIA.
THAT WAS MANY<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> YEARS AGO. BUT I SAW IN HIM THEN WHAT I SEE
IN HIM NOW, A PERSON OF
SUBSTANCE, A PERSON OF PASSION,
PRINCIPAL, INTEGRITY, A GREAT
PERSON WHO BRINGS PEOPLE
TOGETHER.
I CAN'T WAIT FOR THE REST OF THE COUNTRY TO KNOW THE TIM KAINE I KNOW, AND THAT VIRGINIA KNOWS.
[APPLAUSE] REP.

TO THE HALT OF THE U.S. CAPITOL,
I STILL SEEN TIM KAINE THE SAME
SENSE OF PURPOSE.
THE FUNDAMENTAL GOODNESS THAT HAS LED HIM TO BECOME A CIVIL
RIGHTS LAWYER. LISTENING TO HIS NEIGHBORS CONCERNS AND FEARS. WRITING FOR THE UNDERSERVED AND
UNDERREPRESENTED. FINDING SOLUTIONS TO MAKE OUR COMMUNITIES BETTER AND MORE
FAIR. THE BIBLE CALLS IN US JUSTLY TO LOVE MERCIFULLY AND TO WALK HIM
WITH. THERE ARE A FEW PEOPLE WHO LIVE UP THAT CREED AND FULLY AND THAT IS TIM KAINE. MY FELLOW AMERICANS, TONIGHT WE HAVE NOMINATED A TRULY HONORABLE MAN FOR THE OFFICE OF VICE
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
OF AMERICA.
AND MY FRIEND, THE GENTLEMAN FROM VIRGINIA, TIM KAINE.

<p class='short_transcript'> >> AMERICA WAS BUILT ON COURAGE,
ON IMAGINATION AND AN TERMINATION TO THE JOB AT HAND. A LIGHT BILL ON SELFLESS AND HUMBLE SERVICE.
A MIDWESTERN START<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> IN A
WORKING-CLASS HOME IN KANSAS
CITY WHERE HIS MOTHER AND FATHER
INSTILLED IN HIM THE PRINCIPLES
OF FAITH AND HARD WORK.
PITCHING IN AT HIS DAD'S I WORK
IN SHOCK. HE LEARNED THE TOOLS OF THE
TRADE. OFTEN COLLEGE AT MIZZOU AND THAT HARVARD LAW SCHOOL. AFTER WHICH HE TOOK A YEAR OFF
AND SERVED AS A CHRISTIAN MISSIONARY IN HONDURAS. WHERE HE TAUGHT CARPENTER IN WELDING SKILLS. THEY IN TURN TAUGHT HIM SPANISH AND HE HAS SO MUCH TO LEARN FROM ONE ANOTHER -- TAUGHT HIM THAT
WE HAVE SO MUCH TO LEARN FROM
ONE ANOTHER. HE RETURNED TO MET THE LOVE OF HIS LIFE AND WAS EMBRACED BY
FAMILIES THAT HAVE BEEN BREAKING GROUND ON CIVIL RIGHTS AND POLITICAL COURAGE. HER FATHER WAS THE REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR OF VIRGINIA AND WAS A LEADER IN DESEGREGATION OF
SCHOOLS. SETTING HIS DAUGHTERS TO A
MAJORITY BLACK PUBLIC SCHOOL. TIM AND AND WERE MARRIED IN THE SAME RICHMOND, VIRGINIA TURKEY THEY STILL ATTEND TODAY. TIM BEGAN AS A CIVIL RIGHTS
LAWYER FOCUSED ON FIGHTING HOUSING DISCRIMINATION, INSURANCE COMPANIES AND
INJUSTICE. EVENTUALLY HE RAN FOR CITY
COUNCIL.
HE BECAME RICHMOND'S MAYOR
SOLVING PROBLEMS BY BRINGING
PEOPLE TOGETHER.
M AND TIM WERE RAISING A FAMILY.
SENDING THEIR CHILDREN TO THE
SAME PUBLIC SCHOOL AND ATTENDED. THEY STILL ATTENDED THE SAME
HOUSE THEY FIRST MOVED INTO 24
YEARS AGO. TIM WAS ELECTED LIEUTENANT
GOVERNOR OF VIRGINIA AND IN 2005, WHEN A HARD-FOUGHT
ELECTION FOR GOVERNOR.
MAKING TOUGH DECISIONS FACING
THE DEEPEST RECESSIONS SINCE THE 1930'S. AND TIM KAINE'S PROBLEM-SOLVING
EARNED NATIONAL RECOGNITION FOR
HIS WORK IN TOUGH TIMES. VIRGINIA WAS NAMED THE BEST DAY
IN AMERICA TO RAISE A CHILD.
IN THE BEST DATE FOR BUSINESS.
IT HAD ONE OF THE LOWEST
UNEMPLOYMENT RATES IN ONE OF THE HIGHEST FAMILY INCOMES. BUT HIS TIMING GOVERNOR ALSO SAW
HIS A DARKENED B BY WHAT HE
CALLS ARE QUESTION BE THE WORST
DAY OF HIS LIFE. HE HELPED HER COME TOGETHER
