<strong>Michelle Obama</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> THANK YOU ALL, THANK YOU SO
MUCH.
[CHEERING] IT IS HARD TO BELIEVE THAT IT
HAS BEEN EIGHT YEARS SINCE I
FIRST CAME TO THIS CONVENTION TO
TALK WITH<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> YOU ABOUT WHY I
THOUGHT MY HUSBAND SHOULD BE PRESIDENT.
[CHEERING] REMEMBER HOW I TOLD YOU ABOUT HIS CHARACTER AND HIS
CONVICTION? HIS DECENCY AND GRACE? THE TRAITS WE HAVE SEEN EVERY DAY HE HAS SERVED OUR COUNTRY IN
THE WHITE HOUSE.
[CHEERING] I ALSO TOLD YOU ABOUT OUR DAUGHTERS, HOW THEY ARE THE
HEART OF OUR HEARTS, THE CENTER
OF OUR WORLD AND DURING OUR TIME
IN THE WHITE HOUSE, WE HAVE HAD
THE JOY OF WATCHING THEM GROW
FROM BUBBLY LITTLE GIRLS INTO
POISED YOUNG WOMEN. A JOURNEY THAT STARTED SOON
AFTER WE ARRIVED IN WASHINGTON WHEN THEY SET OFF FOR THE FIRST DAY AT THE NEW SCHOOL. I WILL NEVER FORGET THAT WINTER
MORNING AS I WATCHED OUR GIRLS,
JUST SEVEN AND 10 YEARS OLD PILE
INTO THOSE BLACK SUVS WITH ALL
THOSE MEN WITH GUNS.
[LAUGHTER] AND THAT'S ALL THEIR LITTLE
FACES PRESSED UP AGAINST THE WINDOW AND THE ONLY THING I
COULD THINK WAS, WHAT HAVE WE DONE?
[LAUGHTER] AT THAT MOMENT, I REALIZED THAT
OUR TIME IN THE WHITE HOUSE WOULD FORM THE FOUNDATION OF WHO
THEY WOULD BECOME. AND HOW WELL WE MANAGE THIS
EXPERIENCE COULD TRULY MAKE OR
BREAK THEM. THAT IS WHAT ROCK AND I THINK ABOUT -- BARACK AND I THINK ABOUT EVERYDAY AS HE TRIED TO
GUIDE AND PROTECT OUR GIRLS FROM THE CHALLENGES OF THIS
UNUSUAL LIFE AND THE SPOTLIGHT.
HOW HE URGED THEM TO IGNORE
THOSE WHO QUESTION THEIR FATHER
CITIZENSHIP OR FAITH.
[CHEERING] HOW WE INSIST THAT THE HATEFUL LANGUAGE THEY HEAR FROM PUBLIC
FIGURES ON TV DOES NOT REPRESENT
THE TRUE SPIRIT OF THIS COUNTRY.
[CHEERING] HOW WE EXPLAIN THAT WHEN SOMEONE IS CRUEL OR ACTS LIKE A BULLY,
YOU DON'T STOOP TO THEIR LEVEL. OUR MOTTO IS, WHEN THEY GO LOW,
WE GO HIGH.
[CHEERING] WITH EVERY WORD WE UTTER, WITH EVERY ACTION WE TAKE, WE KNOW
OUR KIDS ARE WATCHING US. WE AS PARENTS ARE THE MOST
IMPORTANT ROLE MODEL. LET ME TELL YOU, BARACK AND I
TAKE THAT SAME APPROACH TO OUR
JOBS AS PRESIDENT AND FIRST LADY
BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT OUR WORDS
AND ACTIONS MATTER, NOT JUST TO
OUR GIRLS, BUT THE CHILDREN
ACROSS THIS COUNTRY.
[CHEERING] KID TO TELL AS I SAW YOU ON TV, I WROTE THE REPORT ON YOU FOR
SCHOOL. KIDS LIKE THE LITTLE BLACK BOY
WHO LOOKED UP AT MY HUSBAND, HIS
EYES WIDE WITH HOPE AND HE WONDERED, AS MY HAIR LIKE YOURS?
[CHEERING] MAKE NO MISTAKE ABOUT IT, THIS
NOVEMBER, WHEN WE GET TO THE POLLS, THAT IS WHAT WE ARE DECIDED.
NOT DEMOCRAT OR REPUBLICAN, NOT
LEFT TO RIGHT, IN THIS ELECTION, AND EVERY ELECTION, IT IS ABOUT WHO WILL HAVE THE POWER TO SHAPE
OUR CHILDREN FOR THE NEXT FOUR
OR EIGHT YEARS OF THEIR LIVES.
[CHEERING] I AM YOU TONIGHT BECAUSE IN THIS ELECTION, THERE IS ONLY ONE PERSON WHO I TRUST WITH THAT
RESPONSIBILITY, ONLY ONE PERSON
WHO I BELIEVE IS TRULY QUALIFIED TO BE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED
STATES AND THAT IS OUR FRIEND HILLARY CLINTON.
[CHEERING] THAT IS RIGHT.
[CHEERING] I TRUST HILLARY TO LEAD THIS COUNTRY BECAUSE I HAVE SEEN HER LIFELONG DEVOTION TO OUR NATIONS CHILDREN. NOT JUST HER OWN DAUGHTER WHO
SHE HAS WRITTEN PROTECTION -- RAISED TO PERFECTION. BUT EVERY CHILD WHO NEEDS A
CHAMPION. KID TO TAKE THE LONG WAY TO SCHOOL TO AVOID THE GANGS. KIDS WHO WONDER HOW THEY WILL
EVER AFFORD COLLEGE.
KIDS WHOSE PARENTS DON'T
SPEAKER WORD OF ENGLISH BUT DREAM OF A BETTER LIFE.
WHO LOOK TO US TO DREAM OF WHAT
THEY CAN BE. HILLARY HAS SPENT DECADES DOING
THE RELENTLESS WORK TO ACTUALLY MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN THEIR
LIVES.
[CHEERING] ADVOCATING FOR KIDS WITH DISABILITIES AS A YOUNG LAWYER
FIGHTING FOR CHILDREN HEALTH
CARE AS FIRST LADY AND FOR
QUALITY CHILDCARE IN THE SENATE. AND WHEN SHE DID NOT WIN THE
NOMINATION EIGHT YEARS AGO, SHE
DID NOT GET ANGRY OR
DISILLUSIONED.
[CHEERING] HILLARY DID NOT PACK UP AND GO HOME BECAUSE AS A TRUE OF
EXURBAN, HILLARY KNOWS THAT THIS
IS SO MUCH BIGGER THAN HER OWN
DISAPPOINTMENT.
[CHEERING] SHE PROBABLY STEPPED UP TO SERVE
OUR COUNTRY ONCE AGAIN AS
SECRETARY OF STATE TRAVELING THE GLOBE TO KEEP ART KIDS SAFE.
-- OUR KIDS SAY. THERE WERE BUDGET MOMENTS WHEN
HILLARY COULD HAVE DECIDED THAT
THIS WORK WAS TOO HARD, THAT THE
PRICE OF PUBLIC SERVICE WAS TOO
HIGH, THAT HE WAS TIRED OF BEING
ACTIVE PART FOR HOW SHE LOOKED OR HOW SHE TALKED OR EVEN HOW
SHE LAUGHED. BUT HERE'S THE THING, WHAT I
ADMIRE MOST ABOUT HILLARY IS THAT SHE NEVER BUCKLES UNDER
PRESSURE. SHE NEVER TAKES THE EASY WAY
OUT. AND HILLARY CLINTON HAS NEVER
QUIT ON ANYTHING IN HER LIFE.
[CHEERING] AND WHEN I THINK ABOUT THE KIND
OF PRESIDENT THAT I WANT FOR MY GIRLS AND ALL OUR CHILDREN, THAT
IS WHAT I WANT. I WANT SOMEONE WITH THE PROVEN
STRENGTH TO PERSEVERE. SOMEBODY WHO KNOWS THIS JOB AND
TAKES IT SERIOUSLY.
SOMEBODY WHO UNDERSTAND THAT THE
ISSUES OF OUR NATION ARE NOT
BLACK OR WHITE.
IT CANNOT BE BOILED DOWN TO 140
CHARACTERS.
[CHEERING] BECAUSE WHEN YOU HAVE THE NUCLEAR CODES AT YOUR FINGERTIPS
AND THE MILITARY IN YOUR COMMAND
, YOU CAN'T MAKE SNAP DECISIONS. YOU CAN'T HAVE A THIN SKIN OR A
TENDENCY TO LASH OUT.
YOU NEED TO BE STEADY AND
MEASURED AND WELL-INFORMED.
[CHEERING] I WANT A PRESIDENT WITHOUT -- WITH A RECORD OF PUBLIC SERVICE.
SOMEONE WHO'S LIFE WORK SHOWS
OUR CHILDREN THAT WE DON'T CHASE
FAME AND FORTUNE FOR OURSELVES, WE FIGHT TO GIVE EVERYONE A
CHANCE TO SUCCEED.
[CHEERING] AND WE GET BACK EVEN WHEN WE ARE
STRUGGLING OURSELVES BECAUSE WE
KNOW THAT THERE THERE IS SOMEONE WORSE OFF.
I THE GRACE OF GOD, GO BY. I WANT A PRESIDENT WHO WILL
TEACH OUR CHILDREN THAT EVERYONE
IN THIS COUNTRY MATTERS. A PRESIDENT THAT TRULY BELIEVES IN THE PATIENT THAT OUR FOUNDERS
PUT FORTH ALL THOSE YEARS AGO
THAT WE ARE ALL CREATED EQUAL, EACH A BELOVED PART OF THE GREAT
AMERICAN STORY.
[CHEERING] WHEN CRISIS HITS, WE DON'T TURN
AGAINST EACH OTHER, WE LISTEN TO
EACH OTHER.
WE LEAN ON EACH OTHER.
WE ARE ALWAYS STRONGER TOGETHER.
[CHEERING] I AM HERE TONIGHT BECAUSE I KNOW
THAT THAT IS THE KIND OF
PRESIDENT HILLARY CLINTON WILL BE AND THAT IS WHY IN THIS ELECTION, I'M WITH HER.
[CHEERING] YOU SEE, HILLARY UNDERSTANDS
THAT THE PRESIDENT IS ABOUT ONE
THING AND ONE THING ONLY, IT IS ABOUT LEAVING SOMETHING BETTER FOR OUR KIDS. THAT IS HOW WE HAVE ALWAYS MOVED
THIS COUNTRY FORWARD BY ALL OF
US COMING TOGETHER ON BEHALF OF
OUR CHILDREN. VOLUNTEERING TO COACH THE TEAM,
TEACH THE SUNDAY SCHOOL CLASS,
BECAUSE THEY KNOW IT TAKES A
VILLAGE.
[CHEERING] HEROES OF EVERY COLOR AND CREED WHO WEAR THE UNIFORM AND RISK THEIR LIVES TO PASS ON THOSE BLESSINGS OF LIBERTY, POLICE OFFICERS AND PROTESTERS IN
DALLAS WHO ALL THAT REALLY WANT TO KEEP OUR CHILDREN SAFE,
PEOPLE WHO LINED UP IN ORLANDO
TO DONATE BLOOD BECAUSE IT COULD
HAVE BEEN THEIR SON, OR THE
DAUGHTER IN THE CLUB.
[CHEERING] LEADERS LIKE TIM KAINE.
[CHEERING] WHO SHOW OUR KIDS WHAT DECENCY
AND DEVOTION LOOK LIKE. LEADERS LIKE HILLARY CLINTON WHO HAVE THE GUTS AND THE GRACE TO
KEEP COMING BACK AND PUTTING THOSE CRACKS IN THE HIGHEST AND
HARDEST GLASS CEILING UNTIL THEY FINALLY BREAKTHROUGH LIFTING ALL
OF US ALONG WITH HER.
[CHEERING] THAT IS THE STORY OF THIS
COUNTRY. THE STORY THAT HAS BROUGHT ME TO
THE STAGE TONIGHT. THE STORY OF GENERATIONS OF PEOPLE WHO FELT THE LASH OF BONDAGE, THE SHAME OF SERVITUDE. THE STING OF SEGREGATION WHO
CAPS ON STRIVING AND HOPING AND
DOING WHAT NEEDED TO BE DONE SO THAT TODAY, I WAKE UP EVERY MORNING AND A HOUSE THAT WAS
BUILT BY SLAVES.
[CHEERING] AND I WATCH MY DAUGHTER'S, TWO BEAUTIFUL INTELLIGENT BLACK YOUNG WOMEN PLAYED WITH THE DOG
ON THE WHITE HOUSE LAWN.
[CHEERING] AND BECAUSE OF HILLARY CLINTON, MY DAUGHTERS AND ALL OF OUR SONS
AND DAUGHTERS NOW TAKE FOR
GRANTED THAT A WOMAN CAN BE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.
[CHEERING] DON'T LET ANYONE EVER TELL YOU THAT THIS COUNTRY IS NOT GREAT. THAT SOMEHOW WE NEED TO MAKE A
GREAT AGAIN. BECAUSE THIS RIGHT NOW IS THE
GREATEST COUNTRY ON EARTH.
[CHEERING] AND AS MY DAUGHTER PER PERSON
SET OUT ON THE WORLD, I WANT A
LEADER WHO IS WORTHY OF THAT TRUTH, A LEADER WORTHY OF MY
GIRLS PROMISE AND ALL OF OUR
KIDS PROMISE.
A LEADER WHO WILL BE GUIDED
EVERY DAY BY THE LOVE AND HOPE
AND IMPOSSIBLY BIG DREAMS THAT
WE ALL HAVE FOR OUR CHILDREN. IN THIS ELECTION, WE CANNOT SIT BACK AND HOPE THAT EVERYTHING WORKS OUT FOR THE BEST, WE CANNOT AFFORD TO BE TIRED OR FRUSTRATED OR CYNICAL, GERMANY,
-- HEAR ME, BETWEEN NOW AND
NOVEMBER, WE NEED TO DO WHAT WE
DID IT YEARS AGO AND FOUR YEARS AGO -- EIGHT YEARS AGO AND FOUR YEARS AGO, WE NEED TO KNOCK ON EVERY DOOR, WE NEED TO GET OUT EVERY BOAT, -- VOTE, WE NEED TO
POUR EVERY LAST OUNCE OF
PASSION INTO ELECTING HILLARY
CLINTON AS PRESIDENT OF THE
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.
[CHEERING] LET'S GET TO WORK. THANK YOU ALL AND GOD BLESS.
[CHEERING]
