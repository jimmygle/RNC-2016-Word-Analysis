<strong>Unidentified Speaker</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> I'M FROM NILES, OHIO. AN OLD MANUFACTURING TOWN IN THE
STEEL BELT. HALFWAY BETWEEN CLEVELAND AND
PITTSBURGH. WHEN OUR LARGEST DEAL PLANT CLOSED, ON<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> SEPTEMBER 19, 1977, 5000 WORKERS LOST THEIR JOBS
OVERNIGHT. OVER THE NEXT DECADE, 40,000 MORE LOST THEIRS. FAMILIES WERE WRECKED, COMMUNITIES DESTROYED AND WE FELT BETRAYED.
WE WERE FIGHTERS.
WE WERE GRITTY AND WE STUCK
TOGETHER. AND WE NEVER LOST THE BASIC AMERICAN VALUE OF RESPECT FOR WORK AND RESPECT FOR WORKERS.
[CHEERS] FOR 40 YEARS, MY GRANDFATHER WAS
A STEELWORKER. ONE DAY, LATE IN HIS LIFE, ON A SNOWY OHIO MORNING, HE ASKED ME
TO TAKE AND GROCERY SHOPPING. WE WOULD GO TO ONE STORE FOR ME,
ANOTHER FOR CHEESE, IT HE WAS
ALWAYS LOOKING FOR THE SALE. MANY HOURS LATER, WITH ONE LAST
STOP LEFT, I ASKED GRANDPA,
COULD WE PLEASE GO TO THE CLOSEST DOOR -- STORE? AND HE SAID NO, THE MEAT CUTTERS ARE ON STRIKE AND WE WILL NOT
CROSS THAT COULD 
-- PICKET LINE.
[CHEERS] THAT IS HOW I WAS RAISED. THAT IS HOW MANY OF YOU WERE RAISED.
WHEN IN DOUBT, WE ARE ON THE
SIDE OF THE WORKERS BECAUSE WE RESPECT THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO
PUNCH A CLOCK. THE ONES WHO SHOWER AFTER THEY
GET HOME FROM THE JOB. WE RESPECT THE FIGHTERS WHO GO
TO WORK EARLY, STAY LATE, AND
POUR THEIR HEARTS INTO WHAT THEY
DO. BUT DONALD TRUMP, NOT SO MUCH. HE HAS BEEN STABBING WORKERS IN
THE BACK FOR YEARS. DONALD TRUMP GOT RICH. RIPPING PEOPLE OFF. STIFFING SMALL BUSINESSES AND
CONTRACTORS. NOW HE SAYS HE IS GOING TO BRING
OUR JOBS BACK. HEY, OHIO. WE AIN'T BUYING IT. THIS GUY CUTS DEALS TO MAKE THE TRUMP PRODUCTS AND CHINA,
MEXICO, BANGLADESH. NOT YOUNGSTOWN, NOT AKRON, NOT NILES, NOT PITTSBURGH. IF HE REALLY CARES, IF HE REALLY
CARED ABOUT OUR JOBS, HE WOULD
HAVE HIRED SOME OF OUR PEOPLE. TRUMP WILL TAKE CARE OF
MILLIONAIRES LIKE HIMSELF.
NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT.
BUT WHAT ABOUT THE REST OF US?
WE WILL END UP HOLDING THE BAG,
AGAIN. ECONOMISTS SAY HE HAS PROMISED
HIM A TAX BREAKS TO RICH GUYS AND CORPORATIONS IT WILL COST US
$3.5 MILLION -- 3.5 MILLION JOBS
AND PUT US DEEPER INTO DEBT. AND HE SAYS HE WILL LET WALL
STREET GAMBLE WITH OUR ECONOMIC
SECURITY.
AGAIN. THIS IS NOT A ROADMAP. NOT FOR A BETTER FUTURE.
IT IS WHAT TANKED OUR ECONOMY IN 2008. DONALD TRUMP IS NOT ON OUR SIDE. YOU KNOW WHO IS? HILLARY CLINTON.
[CHEERS] SHE RESPECTS WORKERS AND SHE HAS A PLAN TO HELP THEM. IN HER PURSE ON HUNDRED DAYS, SHE WILL MAKE THE BIGGEST INVESTMENT IN GOOD PAYING JOBS
SINCE WORLD WAR II. SHE WILL PUT PEOPLE TO WORK BY REPAIRING ROADS AND BRIDGES AND SCHOOLS AND HER MAKE IT IN
AMERICA PLAN WILL PUT $10
BILLION INTO REBUILDING OUR
MANUFACTURING SECTOR.
[CHEERS] THIS INITIATIVE WILL BE A HUGE
SHOT IN THE ARM FOR OUR AUTOWORKERS, STEELWORKERS AND
OUR FRIENDS IN THE BUILDING AND
CONSTRUCTION TRADE.
[CHEERS] AND HILLARY CLINTON HAS PROPOSED A PLAN THAT LETS WORKERS SHARE
IN THE PROFITS THEY HELP CREATE. BECAUSE HILLARY KNOWS THAT WORKING PEOPLE BUILT THIS
COUNTRY TOGETHER.
[CHEERS] OUR WORKERS DESERVE RESPECT. THEY DESERVE PEACE OF MIND AND
OUR WORKERS DESERVE A PIECE OF
THE PIE. THEY DESERVE A PRESIDENT WHO
WILL PUT THEM FIRST AND IT IS UP
TO US TO ELECT ONE. AS A CATHOLIC SCHOOLBOY AT JOHN
F. KENNEDY HIGH SCHOOL IN OHIO, MY FAVORITE BIBLE VERSE BECAME ISAIAH CHAPTER SIX. THEN I HEARD THE VOICE OF THE LORD SAY, WHOM SHALL I SEND A? WHO WILL GO FOR US? HERE I AM, SEND ME. AT EVERY STAGE OF HER LIFE, HILLARY CLINTON HAS SAID SEND ME. WHEN OUR CHILDREN NEEDED HEALTH
CARE, HILLARY SAID, SEND ME. WHEN OUR FIRST RESPONDERS IN NEW YORK AND NEW JERSEY NEEDED
SUPPORT AFTER 9/11, HILLARY
SAID, SEND ME. WHEN PRESIDENT OBAMA NEEDED A
SECRETARY OF STATE TO REBUILD
AMERICA'S STANDING IN THE WORLD, HILLARY SAID SEND ME. WHEN AFRICAN AMERICANS INTO THE
RIGHT TO VOTE, HILLY CLINTON
SAID SEND ME. IN EACH OF THESE TIMES SHE GOT
IT DONE.
[CHEERS] NOW IT IS OUR TURN. FIND OUT HOW YOU CAN GET INVOLVED.
YOU CAN EVEN DOWNLOAD HILLARY'S APP. TO GET YOUR PHONE -- TAKE OUT YOUR PHONE. LET'S SEND HER ALL THE WAY TO
THE WHITE HOUSE.
[CHEERS] BECAUSE JUST LIKE WORKERS ON THE
JOB, WE ARE STRONGER WHEN WE ARE TOGETHER. STRONGER TOGETHER WHEN OUR ECONOMY WORKS FOR EVERYONE, STRONGER TOGETHER WHEN WE WORK
WITH OUR ALLIES TO KEEP OUR
NATION SAFE, STRONGER TOGETHER
WHEN EVERY CITIZEN IN AMERICA
HAS AN OPPORTUNITY TO LIVE THE AMERICAN DREAM AND TONIGHT,
YOU'LL HEAR FROM HILLARY CLINTON ON HOW SHE WILL LEAD US TO OUR
BEST DAYS TOGETHER. THANK YOU SO MUCH.

<strong>Unidentified Speaker</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> ON TONY GOLDWYN.
I'M HERE IN PHILADELPHIA STANDING IN THE SMB RIM OF
INDEPENDENCE HALL. IT IS HARD TO BELIEVE, THIS
RELATIVELY SMALL ROOM IS THE BIRTHPLACE<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> OF OUR GREAT NATION. THE YEAR WAS 1776. IT WAS HOT. NOT JUST THE WEATHER. THE PATRIOTS HAD ALREADY STARTED FIGHTING THE MIGHTY EMPIRE IN
THE WORLD.
THIS IS WHERE THEY GATHER TO
FINALLY WRITE FREE AND DECLARE
BREAK FREE AND DECLARE THAT HERE
IN AMERICA WE MUST BE IN CONTROL
OF OUR DESTINY. WE HAVE AN UNALIENABLE RIGHT TO
LIFE, LIBERTY AND THE PURSUIT OF
HAPPINESS. A FEW YEARS LATER, RIGHT HERE IN THIS ROOM, OUR YOUNG COUNTRY
THROUGHOUT THE CONSTITUTION, A BLUEPRINT FOR THE DEMOCRATIC GOVERNMENT WHICH MAY BE UNITED STATES THE GREATEST COUNTRY ON
EARTH. THE WORDS WRITTEN HERE CENTURIES AGO GIVE US THE FREEDOM TO SPEAK
OUR MIND, WORSHIP AS WE CHOOSE
AND TO SELECT OUR OWN
GOVERNMENT. WHY FOUND IN GOVERNMENT -- DOCUMENTS WERE POWERFUL, THEY
WERE NOT PERFECT. WOMEN AND AFRICAN-AMERICANS CANNOT VOTE. NOT ONE OF THE GUYS DEBITED.
IT BACK THEN COULD HAVE IMAGINED
WHAT YOU ARE DOING THIS WEEK,
NONE OF THEM. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA OR A
PRESIDENT HILLARY CLINTON. HOWEVER, THE FRAMERS KNEW THAT
LIFE IN THEIR TIME SHOULD NOT DETERMINE LIFE FOR ALL TIME.
THE FUTURE OF THE COUNTRY WOULD
BE UP TO US.
IN EACH GENERATION, AMERICANS
FROM ALL WALKS OF LIFE AND ALL AGES HAS TO TO PERFECT THE UNION
ARE FROM RESTRICTED. FREDERICK DOUGLAS, LEANNE WOOD GARRISON -- WILLIAM LLOYD GARRISON, THE 200 WOMAN WHO
GATHERED AT SENECA FALLS, A
SEAMSTRESS NAMED ROSA PARKS WHO
BY SETTING DOWN STOOD UP. LATINO FARMWORKERS WHO CAME TOGETHER TO SECURE BASIC DIGNITY
FOR HARD WORK. AND OUR LGBT BROTHERS AND
SISTERS WHO TOOK A STAND AT STONEWALL SO THEY COULD BE WHO THEY ARE AND LOVE WHO THEY WANT. BECAUSE OF WHAT THEY DID, WE ARE STRONGER AS A NATION. WE HAD THE TALENT OF ALL OF PEOPLE. IT IS ONLY BY WORKING TOGETHER
AND LOOKING OUT FOR EACH OTHER
THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO SEE THE
PROMISE OF OUR FOUNDERS. ORDINARY PEOPLE OUGHT TO BE OFFICE OF AMERICA'S EXTRA NICE
STORY.
-- EXTRAORDINARY STORY. A STORY OF PROGRESS AND
POSSIBILITY.
WHAT BECOMES OF THE NEXT CHAPTER
IS IN YOUR HANDS.
OUR NATION FACES A LOT OF BIG TOWNS IS -- CHALLENGES AND
HISTORY HAS SHOWN WE WILL MEET
THEM IF WE ARE ACTIVE, ENGAGED
AND INVOLVED. I WANT TO SHOW YOU SOMETHING. THIS IS THE CHAIR WHERE GEORGE
WASHINGTON SAT DURING THE DISCUSSION. ONE OF THE FEATURES IS THE SON
-- SUN.AND AFTER THE
PRESENTATION WAS FINISHED
, A BEN FRANKLIN TURNED TO HIS
DELICATE AND SAID I'VE OFTEN
LOOKED UP AT BEHIND THE PRESIDENT WITHOUT BEING ABLE TO TELL WHETHER IT WAS RISING OR
SETTING, NOW I KNOW, IT IS A RISING SUN. THAT IS THE STORY OF AMERICA. AND I ASK ALL OF YOU TO DO YOUR
PART AND MAKE SURE THAT IN ALL
THE DAYS THAT DON ON THIS, THE PRINCIPAL AND VALUES HERE, FREEDOM, EQUALITY, COMMUNITY, OPPORTUNITY ARE PROMISES KEPT
FOR EVERY AMERICAN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
