<strong>Sharon Belkofer</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> HELLO, OHIO!
[CHEERS] YOU ARE ALL PROBABLY WONDERING WHO THE HECK IS THIS LITTLE OLD LADY.
[LAUGHTER] I AM A MOM TO THREE BOYS WHO
SERVED THEIR COUNTRY.
[CHEERS]<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> A RETIRED NURSE AND A WIFE OF 52 YEARS, A GRANDMA OF 10 AND NOW A
GREAT GRANDMA.
[CHEERS] I KNOW THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS
MEANT SO MUCH TO MILLIONS OF AMERICANS ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY
I WOULD LIKE TO TELL YOU WHAT HE
MEANS TO ME. SIX YEARS AGO, ON THE MORNING OF
MAY 18, 2010, I BECAME A GOLD STAR MOTHER. WE BEGIN A GOLD STAR FAMILY WHEN MY SON, LIEUTENANT COLONEL, WAS
KILLED IN AFGHANISTAN.
I FIRST MET THE SENATE -- PRESIDENT SHORTLY AFTER. HE WAS SCHEDULED TO SPEAK TO THE
MOUNTAIN DIVISION.
BUT WHEN HE HEARD THE GOLD STAR FAMILIES WERE THERE, HE WANTED
TO MEET WITH US. AS HE WAS HUGGING ME, I CRIED
OLIVER HIS SUIT.
-- ALL OVER HIS SUIT. TOM WOULD HAVE BEEN SO
EMBARRASSED.
IT MUST HAVE BEEN OK BECAUSE A YEAR LATER, AT AN EVENT IN MY
HOME STATE OF OHIO, --
[CHEERS] AS I HOPE TO GET A PICTURE SIDE, SOMEONE TOLD ME THE PRESIDENT WO ULD LIKE TO SEE YOU AND I GOT MY SECOND PRESIDENTIAL HUG.
[CHEERS] SO WARM AND KIND, SOME
COMPASSIONATE -- SO COMPASSIONATE.
I WAS SO INSPIRED. MAYBE THIS SWEET OLD LADY COULD
STILL MAKE A DIFFERENCE. I KNEW MY COMMUNITY SCHOOLS
NEEDED MORE RESOURCES SO AT THE AGE OF 73, I TOOK A LEAP OF FAITH AND RAN FOR MY LOCAL
SCHOOL BOARD.
[CHEERS] AND WHEN MY BACK WAS BOTHERING ME, AND I DID NOT FEEL LIKE
KNOCKING ON DOORS, WHEN THE WIND WAS BLOWING AND IT WAS COLD AND DREARY, I THOUGHT OF MY SON
NEVER GAVE UP AND I THOUGHT OF OUR PRESIDENT, HE NEVER GIVES UP.
[CHEERS] SO WHY SHOULD I, WHY SHOULD I BE
DIFFERENT? BESIDES, THEY TELL ME, WALKING
IS GOOD FOR YOUR BACK. GUESS WHAT, I WANT MY ELECTION
-- WON THE ELECTION.
[CHEERS] I WON BIG.
[CHEERS] THE PRESIDENT EVEN SENT ME A HANDWRITTEN NOTE OF
CONGRATULATIONS. THAT IS WHO HE IS. NO MATTER HOW BUSY, HE HAS NEVER
FORGOTTEN THIS LITTLE OLD LADY
IN OHIO WHO HAS ALWAYS HAD HIS
BACK.
[CHEERS] YOU SEE, SOME PEOPLE IN THIS
WORLD MAKE BIG DIFFERENCES. MY SON MADE BIG DIFFERENCES. THE PRESIDENT CONTINUES TO MAKE BIG DIFFERENCES. AND THE SMALLER ONES, TOO, LIKE INSPIRATION HE POURED INTO ME SO THAT I MIGHT MAKE A DIFFERENCE OF MY OWN.
[CHEERS] I WISH EVERY AMERICAN COULD HUG PRESIDENT OBAMA.
[CHEERS] SO THAT THEY COULD SEE THE GOOD
IN HIS EYES AND FEEL THE WARMTH
IN HIS HEART.
[CHEERS] THIS IS OUR PRESIDENT.
