<strong>Unidentified Speaker</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> BY GENERATIONS OF AMERICANS,
I'VE ALWAYS DREAMED ABOUT MAKING THAT PROUD WALK ACROSS THE GRADUATION STAGE TO GET MY
COLLEGE DEGREE. IN 2005, THAT DREAM<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> CAME TRUE. AT GRAND VALLEY STATE
UNIVERSITY. WITH PREPARE ME TO DO WHAT I LOVE, TEACH BACK HOME AT OUR
CALENDAR.
-- NORTH CAROLINA.
[CHEERS] THEN CAME THE BILLS.
$40,000 IN STUDENT DEBT AND ALL THE ANXIETY AND STRUGGLE THAT COMES WITH IT. TEACHING OFFER SO MANY REWARDS,
A BIG SALARY IS NOT ONE OF THEM. A $300 CHECK I READ EVERY MONTH
REPRESENTS SAVINGS I CAN PUT AWAY, CAR REPAIRS I CAN'T MAKE, MEDICAL COSTS I HAVE TO PUT OFF
IN WITH MY WIFE, AMANDA, AND
SCHOOL AFTER TAKING TIME OFF TO
HELP CARE FOR HER SICK MOTHER,
ANOTHER $30,000 BILL IS ON THE
WAY. LIFE FEELS LIKE WE ARE RUNNING
ON A TREADMILL. NO MATTER HOW HARD WE TRY, WE CAN'T GET AHEAD. AND I'M NOT ALONE. STUDENT DEBT HAS MORE THAN
DOUBLED IN THE LAST DECADE AND NOW EXCEEDS $1.2 TRILLION.
NONE OF US ARE LOOKING FOR GUARANTEE SUCCESS. JUST A FAIR CHANCE AT IT.
THAT IS WHY I'M SO PROUD TO
SUPPORT HILLARY CLINTON FOR
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.
[CHEERS] SHE'S GOT TO MAKE COLLEGE
DEBT-FREE FOR ALL AND WILL HELP
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE LIKE ME WITH EXISTING DEBT SAVE THOUSANDS OF
DOLLARS.
I DON'T KNOW HER, BUT IT FEELS
LIKE SHE KNOWS ME. HILLARY CLINTON HAS ARE BACK,
LET'S MAKE SURE WE HAVE HERS
THIS NOVEMBER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

<p class='short_transcript'> >> FOUR MONTHS AGO, HILLARY
CLINTON SAT WITH ME IN A DONUT
SHOP IN OHIO. SHE ASKED IF YOU'RE MY STORY. I TOLD HER THAT MY HUSBAND AND I
WORKED THREE JOBS<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> JUST TO MAKE
ENDS MEET. BETWEEN US, WE WORK FOR 24 HOURS A DAY. WE ONLY SEE EACH OTHER WHEN THEY
PASS EACH OTHER IN THE DOORWAY. WHEN ONE OF US IS COMING HOME
AND THE OTHER IS LEAVING. I ONLY SEE MY KIDS WHEN THEY ARE
ONLY IN BED.
I GET HOME TOO LATE TO SPEND
QUALITY TIME WITH THEM. OUR LIFE IS CONSUMED BY WORKED
BUT WE ARE STILL CRUSHED BY
DEBT. MEDICAL, STUDENT LOANS, WE HAVE
NO SAVINGS.
WE WORK HARD AND YET IT FEELS
LIKE THE WORLD IS AGAINST US. I TOLD HILLARY CLINTON THAT EVEN
THOUGH EVERY DAY IS A STRUGGLE,
WE DON'T WANT A HANDOUT. WE WANT TO HAD TO HELP US UP. SHE UNDERSTOOD. SHE BELIEVED THAT AMERICA STRONGER WHEN WE LOOK OUT FOR
ONE ANOTHER. WHAT NO ONE WHO WORKS FULL-TIME
HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN MAKING A CAR MAY MEANT -- PAYMENT AND
SEEING CHILDREN.
THAT IS WHY I'M HERE TAKING TIME OFF FROM BOTH OF MY JOBS TO ASK
YOU TO PUT IN THE TIME TO ELECT HILLARY CLINTON AND HELP MAKE
LIFE BETTER FOR ME IN THE EYES OF PEOPLE JUST LIKE ME.
I BELIEVE WE CAN DO IT. AND I BELIEVE IN HILLARY
CLINTON.
THANK YOU.
