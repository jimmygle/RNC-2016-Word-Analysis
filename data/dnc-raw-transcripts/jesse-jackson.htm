<strong>Jesse Jackson</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> REV. JACKSON: THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. LET US STAND PROUDLY FOR THE NEXT PRESIDENT HILLARY RODHAM
CLINTON. LET ME ALSO THINK BERNIE SANDERS
FOR<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> ENERGIZING THIS CAMPAIGN. THE BURN MUST NEVER GROW COLD. WHERE HATE ABOUNDS, LOVE MUST
ABOUND EVEN MORE. WE CALLED STAND IN THE FACE OF
THE WHIRLWIND. THE TUG-OF-WAR FOR AMERICA'S SOUL, WE MUST BUILD RIDGES OF
HOPE AND UNITY. LOVE MUST TRUMP IGNORANCE AND
FEAR AND HATRED AND VIOLENCE. WE MUST LEARN TO LIVE TOGETHER AS BROTHERS AND SISTERS. WE HAVE BEEN TESTED AND TRIED. SHE COULD BE TRUSTED TO BAN ASSAULT WEAPONS. BAND THESE ASSAULT WEAPONS NOW.
[APPLAUSE] SHE CAN BE TRUSTED TO HONOR THE
MOST PROGRESSIVE PLATINUM OUR
PARTNERS EVER HAD. MORE BLACKS ARE INCARCERATED THAN IN COLLEGE. HILLARY UNDERSTANDS THE HOPE AND
PROMISE OF BLACK LIVES MATTER. SHE KNOWS ABOUT OUR SUFFERING FROM TRAYVON MARTIN TO MICHAEL BROWN. THE SHOOTINGS OF YOUNG BLACK MEN
MUST STOP. BAN ON ASSAULT WEAPONS NOW. WE MUST CHOOSE RECONCILIATION. WE SHARE 2000 MILES OF BORDER
WITH MEXICO. WE TRADE MORE WITH MEXICO. STOP INSULTING HISPANIC AND
MUSLIMS NOW. WE CAN TRUST HER NOT TO MASTER PORT 15 MILLION PEOPLE. TO -- SHE WILL SUPPORT BLACK
COLLEGES. WE HAVE NOT LOST A SINGLE JOB AND SHE WILL SUSTAIN THAT DRIVE
AND KEEP THE HOPE ALIVE. WE'VE NEVER LOST A BATTLE THAT WE THOUGHT -- FOUGHT. WE BUILT THE WINNING COALITION AND THIS IS A NEW DAY. SOMEONE HAS TO WIN AND LOSE IN
THE PRIMARY.
IT IS SUPER BOWL TIME. IT IS ANOTHER DAY. BLACKS REGISTER AND VOTE IN GREAT NUMBERS, THAT IS THE ONLY
WAY THEY WIN. IF BLACKS AND HISPANICS VOTE IN GREAT NUMBERS, WOMEN WIN. WHEN WOMEN AND CHILDREN WHEN, WE
ALL WIN. WE ARE AS PRECIOUS AS GOD'S
SIGHT. IT IS HEALING TIME AND HOPE
TIME. IT IS HILLARY TIME. I KNOW IT GETS DARK SOMETIMES BUT THE LORD IS OUR LIGHT AND ALL OUR -- OUR SALVATION. DON'T LET OPPOSITION HINDER YOUR
SYRIA.
IT IS HOPE TIME, IT IS HILLARY
TIME. PEOPLE WILL BE CALLED BY THEIR
NAME. I WILL HEAR THEIR PRAYER, IT IS
HEALING TIME. IT IS HOPE TIME, IT IS HILLARY TIME. IT IS HOPE TIME IT IS HEALING
TIME. IT IS HEALING TIME, IT IS HOPE
TIME.
IT IS HEALING TIME, IT IS HOPE
TIME.
IT IS HILLARY TIME, IT'S HOPE
TIME.
KEEP IT ALIVE, GOD BLESS YOU.
