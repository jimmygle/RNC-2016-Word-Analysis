<strong>Unidentified Speaker</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> GOOD EVENING. IT'S GREAT TO BE HERE FROM LOS
ANGELES. LOS ANGELES IS A CITY WITH SUCH
A HUGE, THRIVING LATINO
POPULATION THAT WE ASK THE ACT DONALD<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> TRUMP -- EXPECT DONALD TRUMP TO BUILD A WALL AROUND US. I AM A PROUD AMERICAN.
AS I TRAVEL AROUND THE COUNTRY, FROM THE MIDWEST TO THE SOUTH, TWO TOWNS ACROSS THE SOUTHWEST I
VISITED DURING THE CAMPAIGN, I
HEARD AMERICANS ANXIOUS ABOUT
THEIR FUTURE.
AND AFTER LAST WEEK'S CONVENTION IN CLEVELAND, I CAN UNDERSTAND
WHY. THERE, INSTEAD OF IDEAS, IT WAS INSULTS.
INSTEAD OF POLICY, IT WAS
POLARIZATION. INSTEAD OF HOPE, IT WAS HATRED. AS A MAYOR, I AM HERE TO TELL YOU, AMERICA'S CITIES DON'T HAVE
TIME FOR THEATRICS. AMERICA'S CITIES HAVE URGENT
PROBLEMS TO SOLVE. THAT IS WHY LOCAL LEADERS ACROSS
AMERICA SUPPORT HILLARY CLINTON,
AND THAT IS WHY WE UNDERSTAND
THAT SHE WILL HELP US TO THE
URGENT WORK OF AMERICA. IN LOS ANGELES, WE LOOK AT
AMERICA'S CRUMBLING INFRASTRUCTURE, AND WE ARE
FIXING IT. PUTTING MORE THAN 500,000 PEOPLE AND $50 BILLION TO WORK REBUILDING AND REPAIRING OUR
ROADS, OUR PORTS, AND OUR
INFRASTRUCTURE. IN LOS ANGELES, WE SAW TOO MANY AMERICANS LIVING IN POVERTY, SO
WE BECAME THE BIGGEST CITY IN AMERICA TO RAISE THE MINIMUM
WAGE TO $15, INSPIRING OTHER CITIES AND STATES TO FOLLOW.
IN LOS ANGELES, WE SAW TOO MANY LIVES LOST TO GUN VIOLENCE, SO WE BANNED HIGH-CAPACITY MAGAZINES AND WE ARE TAKING
ILLEGAL GUNS OFF OUR STREETS. IN LOS ANGELES, WE SAW TOO MANY
HIGH SCHOOL DROPOUTS, TOO MANY
GRADUATES IN DEBT, SO WE ARE MAKING COMMUNITY COLLEGE FREE. WE DIDN'T DO ANY OF THIS BY
FINDING A COMMON ENEMY. WE FOUND A COMMON PURPOSE. AMERICA DOESN'T NEED A POLITICAL
PYROMANIAC FOR PRESIDENT. DONALD TRUMP HAS NO VISION FOR OUR COUNTRY AND NO GENUINE
ANSWER TO OUR CHALLENGES.
HIS VOICE IS LOUD.
HIS LANGUAGE IS COURSE.
HIS POLITICS HAVE A DARK AS THAT
WOULD NOT ONLY -- DARKNESS THAT
WOULD NOT ONLY STOP BUT REVERSE THE MARCH OF PROGRESS TOWARD A GREATER, MORE PROSPEROUS, MORE
EQUAL AMERICA. ELECT DONALD TRUMP AND GET EMPTY
PROMISES AND NO PLANS FOR OUR COUNTRY.
ELECT HILLARY CLINTON AND GET
THE BIGGEST INVESTMENT IN INFRASTRUCTURE SINCE WORLD WAR
II.
ELECT HILLARY CLINTON AND RAISE
THE MINIMUM WAGE ACROSS OUR
COUNTRY. ELECT HILLARY CLINTON AND REDUCE GUN VIOLENCE ON OUR STREETS. ELECT HILLARY CLINTON AND MAKE
DEBT-FREE COLLEGE AVAILABLE TO EVERYBODY. WE HAVE DONE IT IN L.A. WE HAVE DONE IT AS DEMOCRATS AND LOCAL LEADERS ACROSS AMERICAN
CITIES. NOW LET'S DO IT FOR THE ENTIRE COUNTRY.
THAT IS HILLARY CLINTON'S VISION, A UNITED AMERICA WORKING
TOGETHER, AND IT IS THAT VISION THAT MAKES IT POSSIBLE FOR ME TO
BE HERE TONIGHT. I AM JUST YOUR AVERAGE MEXICAN
AMERICAN JEWISH ITALIAN, BUT MY ANCESTORS, MY FORBEARERS ESCAPED
WAR AND PROSECUTION.
THEY CROSSED OCEANS AND RIVERS
TO COME TO THIS IMPROBABLE,
MIRACULOUS DEMOCRACY.
MY GRANDFATHER SALVADOR HE WAS
CARRIED OVER THE BORDER IN HIS MOTHER'S ARMS DURING THE MEXICAN REVOLUTION. MY OTHER GRANDFATHER WAS THE SON
OF RUSSIAN JEWS FLEW IN --
FLEEING PROSECUTION. THEY MADE THEIR LIVES HERE, AND
AFTER PEARL HARBOR ONE OF MY GRANDFATHER'S ANSWERED HIS NATION'S CALL AND MANUFACTURED UNIFORMS FOR GIS.
THE OTHER PUT THAT UNIFORM ON, FOUGHT FOR THE ONLY COUNTRY HE KNEW, CROSS THE OCEAN NEVER
KNOWING IF HE WOULD COME HOME,
AND EARNED HIS CITIZENSHIP AS A
RESULT. TODAY, HIS GRANDSON IS THE MAYOR
OF THE LARGEST CITY OF THE
LARGEST STATE IN OUR UNION. SOME OF US MAKE THE UNIFORMS. SOME OF US WHERE THE UNIFORMS.
BUT EACH OF US HAS A ROLE, AND THAT IS THE GREAT WORK THAT LIES AHEAD, TO BUILD A NATION THAT IS STRONGER THAN THE ONE WE
INHERITED. WHEN WE MOCK IMMIGRANTS OR THE DISABLED, OR WOMEN, WE MOCK OUR OWN HISTORY.
THIS IS A NATION WITH WOMEN ON
ASSEMBLY LINES, JAPANESE-AMERICAN GIS WHOSE FAMILIES WERE IN INTERNMENT CAMPS WON A WAR WITH A PRESIDENT
WHO COULDN'T WALK. THAT IS THE AMERICA I BELIEVE IN
AND THAT IS THE AMERICA WHERE HILLARY CLINTON WILL BE THE NEXT
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.
WE ARE STRONGER TOGETHER. THANK YOU.</span><span class='hidden-full-transcript-ellipses'>...</span></p><a href='#' class='hidden-full-transcript-link'><i class='icon-chevron-down'></i> <span class='link-show-full-text'>Show Full Text</span><i class='icon-chevron-up'></i> <span class='link-show-less-text'>Show Less Text</span></a>
