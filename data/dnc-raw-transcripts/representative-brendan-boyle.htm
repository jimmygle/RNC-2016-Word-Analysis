<strong>Brendan Boyle</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> MR. BOYLE: WELCOME TO THE NATION'S BIRTHPLACE, MY
HOMETOWN, PHILADELPHIA. RIGHT HERE IN THE SWELTERING SUMMER OF 17 776 A NATION WAS
CONCEIVED OUT OF<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> A SHARED COMMITMENT TO POWERFUL IDEALS THAT WOULD INSPIRE THE WORLD
OVER. FATHER CAME TO AMERICA WHEN HE
WAS 19. HE CAME HERE TO ENJOY THE SAME RIGHTS AND PURSUE THE SAME OPPORTUNITIES THAT OUR FOUNDERS
DREAMED OF TWO CENTURIES AGO.
HE KNEW IN THIS COUNTRY IS
CHILDREN WOULD BE CONSIDERED TRUSTS OF AMERICANS AS THE
DESCENDENTS OF THE MAYFLOWER. MY FATHER IS A JANITOR, CLEANING THE SAME TRAIN STATION MANY OF
US RODE PAST TO GET HERE
TONIGHT.
MY MOTHER WAS A SCHOOL CROSSING
GUARD.
MY BROTHER AND I GREW UP IN A
SMALL ROW HOME WHERE WE WERE
RAISED TO BELIEVE IN THIS COUNTRY IF YOU WORK HARD, WHERE
YOU COME FROM DOES NOT DETERMINE
WHERE YOU ARE GOING. THANKS TO THE MANY SACRIFICES, A
LOT OF STUDENT LOANS, AND A LITTLE LUCK, I BECAME THE FIRST
IN MY FAMILY TO GO TO COLLEGE. AS DEMOCRATS, OUR MISSION IS TO
MAKE MORE STORIES LIKE MINE MORE COMMON, NOT LESS SO. BUT ALL DONALD TRUMP WANTS TO DO
IS TELL YOU WHO IS TO BLAME, TO
FAN THE FLAMES OF ANXIETY, AND
TO EXPLOIT THEM IN THE MOST NEGATIVE, DIVISIVE, DANGEROUS WAYS. THIS IS WHY HILLARY CLINTON'S
VISION IS SO IMPORTANT. IT IS THE OPPORTUNITY FOR WAGES
THAT HELP AMERICANS JOIN THE
MIDDLE CLASS AND STAY THERE, A
PLAN TO ENSURE THAT WOMEN
RECEIVE EQUAL PAY FOR EQUAL WORK
, A PATHWAY TO COLLEGE, AND A LADDER INTO THE WORKING WORLD. NOW, DONALD TRUMP SAYS THE AMERICAN DREAM IS DEAD. WHY DOES HE WANT TO LEAD AMERICA WHEN HE DOES NOT EVEN BELIEVE IN AMERICA? DONALD TRUMP IS WRONG.
THIS IS A REMARKABLE COUNTRY. BY GEOGRAPHY AND BY DESTINY, WE
ARE A LAND SET APART. WE DEMOCRATS COME TO
PHILADELPHIA THIS WEEK TO RIO FORM -- REAFFIRM OUR COMMENCED
OUR FOUNDING IDEALS.
WE COME HERE TO RENEW OUR FIGHT
TO MAKE THE AMERICAN TEAM IN
REALITY FOR ALL. WE COME HERE TO ELECT HILLARY CLINTON THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF
THE UNITED STATES.</span><span class='hidden-full-transcript-ellipses'>...</span></p><a href='#' class='hidden-full-transcript-link'><i class='icon-chevron-down'></i> <span class='link-show-full-text'>Show Full Text</span><i class='icon-chevron-up'></i> <span class='link-show-less-text'>Show Less Text</span></a>
