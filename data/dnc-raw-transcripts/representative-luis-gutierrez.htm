<strong>Luis Gutierrez</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> THANK YOU. HELLO, PHILADELPHIA.
[CHEERING] MY PARENTS GREW UP IN PUERTO
RICO.
[CHEERING] THEY WERE NOT EDUCATED. THEY DO NOT ". BUT THEY DID NOT HAVE<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> A WINTER
COAT. THEY CAME TO THE U.S. WHEN I WAS BORN AND I WAS BORN IN CHICAGO.
[CHEERING] MY PARENTS WERE BORN AMERICAN SEASONS, BUT WHEN THEY MOVED
ALONG WITH HALF A MILLION OTHER PUERTO RICANS IN THE 1950'S, THEY WERE GREETED WITH SCORN AND DETERMINATION.
POLITICIANS CALL THEM CRIMINALS. THEY SAID MY PARENTS WERE
DANGEROUS IT WOULD RUIN THE
COUNTRY. SOUND FAMILIAR TO YOU TONIGHT?
[CHEERING] NOBODY SPOKE UP AGAINST THE
BIGOTRY AND HATRED MY PARENTS
INTO WORD.
SO YOU BETTER BELIEVE I'M USING MY VOICE AGAINST THE DISCRIMINATION HERE TODAY.
-- WE HEAR TODAY.
[CHEERING] I WILL RAISE MY VOICE AGAINST
THE BIGOT WHO SPEAKS ABOUT A
JUDGE BORN IN INDIANA WHO CAN DO
HIS JOB BECAUSE HIS PARENTS WERE BORN IN MEXICO.
[CHEERING] I WILL RAISE MY VOICE AGAINST THE BULLY WHO CALLS HARD-WORKING IMMIGRANTS CRIMINALS AND
RAPISTS.
[CHEERING] SOMEONE WHO PROMISES TO ROUND UP AND DEPORT FAMILIES, MILLIONS OF
FAMILIES AND THEN PUT UP A WALL BETWEEN THEM AND US.
>> BOO!
>> JOIN ME IN THAT FIGHT AND SO
HAS HILLARY CLINTON.
[CHEERING] SHE STANDS WITH US SO THAT
AMERICANS REMAIN A WELCOMING NATION.
WE DON'T DISCRIMINATE BECAUSE OF
WHAT YOU LOOK LIKE, WHO YOU LOVE, HOW YOU PRAY, WHAT
LANGUAGE YOUR PARENTS SPEAK OR
WHERE YOU WERE BORN.
[CHEERING] LET'S BE CLEAR, MY PARENTS, WHEN
THEY CAME FROM PUERTO RICO WERE
NOT THE ONLY ONES TO CONFRONT
DISCRIMINATION. EVERY GENERATION OF NEWCOMERS, WHOEVER AND WHEREVER THEY COME FROM, LATIN AMERICA, EUROPE,
AFRICA, ASIA, THE MIDDLE EAST,
THEY ARE MET WITH SKEPTICISM AND SUSPICION. EVERY GENERATION PROVES THE
SKEPTICS WRONG. IMMIGRANTS CONTRIBUTE TO OUR
COMMUNITIES AND MAKE AMERICA A GREAT NATION.
[CHEERING] IMMIGRANTS DIED DIVIDING OUR
DEMOCRACY. AND YOU KNOW WHAT, THEY GIVE A
FOUNDING PRINCIPLE MEANING IN OUR TIMES. EVERY TIME IMMIGRANTS ARE LABELED AS DEMOCRATS, -- THEM,
THEY BECOME PART OF US, WE THE PEOPLE. ABOUT 11 MILLION UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS LIVE, WORK, PAY TAXES AND RAISE THEIR FAMILIES IN THE
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. A LOT OF THEIR FAMILIES, INCLUDE U.S. CITIZENS JUST LIKE ME. LISTEN, NO MATTER WHAT YOUR
FAMILY TREE LOOKS LIKE, A FAIR IMMIGRATION SYSTEM IS BETTER FOR
ALL OF AMERICA.
[CHEERING] NO MATTER WHAT THEY SAY, IT IS
SIMPLY A FANTASY THAT WE ARE
GOING TO ROUND UP AND DEPORT 11
MILLION PEOPLE. IT IS A SICK, HATEFUL FANTASY. LET ME TYPE WHAT GIVES ME HOPE, HILLARY CLINTON DREAM FOR AMERICA WHERE IMMIGRANTS ARE
ALLOWED TO COME OUT OF THE SHADOW, GET RIGHT WITH THE LAW, PAY THEIR TAXES AND NOT FEEL FEAR AS THEIR FAMILIES ARE GOING
TO DEPART.
-- BE RIPPED APART.
[CHEERING] WHEN HILLARY CLINTON STEPS TO THIS PODIUM TO ACCEPT THE
NOMINATION, WE WILL ALL TAKE A
GIANT STEP FORWARD. THE BROAD AND DIVERSE AMERICA THAT FIGHTS FOR AN INCLUSIVE AND FAIR NATION, OUR USING -- UNION
OF BLACK AND BROWN, WHITE AND
AFRICAN, ASIAN PEOPLE, WHO LOVE THE EARTH AND KNOW THAT CLIMATE CHANGE IS REAL AND VALUE EDUCATION, WE WILL ALL STEP UP
TO THE PODIUM WITH HER.
[CHEERING] LISTEN, WE CONTINUE THE WORK OF OUR HEROES LIKE JOHN LEWIS AND DR. LUTHER -- MARTIN LUTHER
KING.
[CHEERING] AND MARTYRS TO ALLOW ME TO HAVE THE ABILITY TO SPEAK FROM THIS PODIUM. WE FIGHT FOR EQUAL RIGHTS AND
WORKERS RIGHTS, WE BELIEVE THAT
WOMEN DESERVE EQUAL PAY FOR
EQUAL WORK IN THIS COUNTRY.
[CHEERING] AND WE WILL NOT STAND IDLY BY
BECAUSE WE BELIEVE CONGRESS HAS TO KEEP THEIR HANDS OFF PLANNED
PARENTHOOD.
[CHEERING] AND WE BELIEVE THAT PEOPLE SHOULD LOVE WHO THEY LOVE AND
MARRY WHO THEY WANT TO MARRY IN
THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.
[CHEERING] WE BELIEVE THAT WHEN YOU SEND
YOUR CHILDREN TO SCHOOL, OR
YOUNG PEOPLE ARE HAVING FUN AT A
NIGHTCLUB, OR YOU WALK A BEAT AS
A POLICE OFFICER AND WALKED DOWN
THE STREET IN YOUR NAME IN
CHICAGO, YOU SHOULD NOT FEAR
BEING SHOT. WE WILL TAKE ON THE NRA AS HILLARY CLINTON IS PRESIDENT OF
THE UNITED STATES.
[CHEERING] YES, WE BELIEVE IN THE COUNTRY WHERE THIS SON OF UNEDUCATED PARENTS CAN SPEAK TO THIS NATION ON THIS PODIUM IN THE CITY WHERE THE UNITED STATES WAS BORN.
[CHEERING] JUNTOS CON HILLARY CLINTON COMO PRESIDENTA SERA LA NACION MEJOR Y MAS FUERTE. WITH HILLARY CLINTON, OUR NATION WILL BE BETTER AND STRONGER.
