<p class='short_transcript'> >> IT IS AN HONOR AND SHOCK TO
BE HERE. NOT BECAUSE OF THE MOMENTOUS NATURE OF THE EVENT OR THE SIZE OF THE CROWD, IT IS A SHOCK BECAUSE UNLIKE MANY OF<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> YOU, I'M A REPUBLICAN.
[CHEERS] 40 YEARS AGO, I KEPT MY -- CAST
MY FIRST VOTE FOR RESIDENT VOTING THAT THEY LIKE AUDI TIME
AND AGAIN.
I HAVE NOT JUST VOTED
REPUBLICAN, I WORKED IN
PRESIDENT REAGAN'S WHITE HOUSE. I RECENTLY LED AN EFFORT TO
PLACE A STATUE OF RONALD
REAGAN AND CALIFORNIA'S CAPITAL.
I'M HERE TONIGHT IS A -- TO SAY I KNEW RONALD REAGAN. DONALD TRUMP, YOU ARE NO RONALD REAGAN.
[CHEERS] PRESIDENT REAGAN FAMOUSLY SAID
TEAR DOWN THIS WALL. TRUMP SAYS, BUILD A WALL BECAUSE
THAT WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT
AGAIN. REAGAN'S ON THE WANTS AND TRUMP
SEES THE WORLD AS US VERSUS THEM
WHERE SOMEBODY WITH BROWN SKIN
OR A FOREIGN SOUNDING NAME IS
LIKELY TO BLAME FOR OUR
TROUBLES. REAGAN KNEW THAT A LEADER NEEDS DIPLOMACY. DONALD TRUMP IS A PETULANT,
DANGEROUSLY UNBALANCED REALITY
STAR SHE WILL CODDLE TYRANTS AND ALIENATE ALLIES.
[CHEERS] I SHUDDER TO THINK WHERE HE WILL
LEAD OUR NATION. FORTUNATELY, I DON'T THINK HE
WILL GET THAT CHANCE.
[CHEERS] WHILE HILLARY HOLDS MANY POLICY POSITIONS DIFFER FROM MY OWN, HER QUALIFICATIONS ARE
INDISPUTABLE. HILLARY KNOWS THAT OUR STRENGTH
AS A NATION LIES IN UNITING, NOT DIVIDING. THIS IS REPUBLICAN PLATFORM IS
THE MOST ALARMING OF EVER SEEN. IT IS LACED WITH ANTI-IMMIGRANT,
ANTI-GAY, ANTI-WOMEN POSITIONS THAT DO NOT REPRESENT THE VIEWS
OF MOST AMERICANS. THAT IS WHY THIS YEAR, I WILL VOTE FOR A DEMOCRAT FOR THE
FIRST TIME.
[CHEERS] TO MY FELLOW REPUBLICANS, IF YOU
BELIEVE LIKE I DO, YOU BELIEVE THAT LOYALTY TO OUR COUNTRY IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN LOYALTY TO
PARTY. IF YOU WANT A PRESIDENT WITH
GOOD JUDGMENT, A STEADY HAND AND
A TEMPERAMENT TO REPRESENT OUR NATION TO THE WORLD, AND OUR CHILDREN, I ASK IS THAT YOU JOIN
ME IN VOTING FOR HELLER CLINTON HILLARY CLINTON AS PRESIDENT OF
THE UNITED STATES.
