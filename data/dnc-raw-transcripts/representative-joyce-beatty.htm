<strong>Unidentified Speaker</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> GOOD EVENING FELLOW
DEMOCRATS. I AM THRILLED TO SEE SO MANY
PEOPLE FROM THE GREAT STATE OF OHIO HERE TONIGHT. IT IS AN HONOR TO BE HERE ON
THIS HISTORIC<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> EVENING. WHEN WE MOVE ONE STEP CLOSER TO ELECTING THE 45TH PRESIDENT OF THESE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. YES, UNITED, NOT DIVIDED.
LIKE HILLARY CLINTON, I KNOW
THAT WE ARE STRONGER TOGETHER.
THIS ELECTION, TO ME, IS ABOUT
TWO FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT VISIONS OF AMERICA. AND I BELIEVE THE CHOICE IS CLEAR. HILLARY CLINTON IS BY FAR THE MOST EXPERIENCED, QUALIFIED, AND
SKILLED CANDIDATE.
SHE CARES DEEPLY ABOUT EACH AND EVERY AMERICAN, NO MATTER WHAT YOU LOOK LIKE, WHERE YOU ARE
FROM, OR WHO YOU LOVE. DONALD TRUMP, ON THE OTHER HAND, IS THE MOST DIVISIVE AND ILL
PREPARED CANDIDATE WE HAVE SEEN
IN MODERN TIMES. LOOKING TO WIND BACK THE CLOCK
ON ALL THE PROGRESS WE HAVE MADE
AS A NATION TOGETHER. HE HAS BUILT A CAREER ON A INTIMIDATION, DISCRIMINATION, AND BULLYING, AT THE EXPENSE OF
AND ON THE BACKS OF SMALL BUSINESSES AND HARD-WORKING
FAMILIES. IN CONTRAST, HILLARY CLINTON HAS DEVOTED HER ENTIRE CAREER TO
LIFTING UP HARD-WORKING FAMILIES.
WOMEN, AND SMALL BUSINESSES. I WANT YOU AND ALL AMERICANS TO
KNOW THAT HILLARY CLINTON -- THE HILLARY CLINTON THAT I KNOW.
THE HILLARY WHO SITS WITH ME AND TALKS ABOUT HER GRANDCHILDREN. CHARLOTTE AND AIDAN. AND MY GRANDCHILDREN, LEAH AND
SPENCER. THE HILLARY WHO SEES UNLIMITED POTENTIAL IN EVERY CHILD.
THE HILLARY WHO FIGHTS FOR CIVIL RIGHTS AND FREEDOM FOR ALL. THE HILLARY WHO WILL FIGHT FOR
THE HOPE OF A BRIGHTER FUTURE, A
MORE INCLUSIVE AMERICA, AND
GREATER GLOBAL PEACE AND COOPERATION.
AMERICANS WANT A COMMANDER IN
CHIEF, NOT A DIVIDER IN CHIEF. I KNOW WHICH ONE I WOULD CHOOSE. AND THAT IS THE FUTURE 45TH
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
OF AMERICA, MY GOOD FRIEND,
HILLARY CLINTON. I'M WITH HER BECAUSE SHE'S WITH
US. I AM CONGRESSWOMAN JOYCE BEATTY,
AND I APPROVE THIS MESSAGE. GOD BLESS YOU, AND GOD BLESS THESE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.
LOVE YOU, OHIO!
