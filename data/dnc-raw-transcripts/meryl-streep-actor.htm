<strong>Meryl Streep</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> MS. STREEP: WE'VE GOT SOME FIGHT
LEFT IN US, DON'T WE? WHAT DOES IT TAKE TO BE THE FIRST FEMALE ANYTHING? IT TAKES GREAT, -- GRIT AND IT TAKES GRACE.<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> DEBORAH SAMSON WAS THE FIRST WOMAN TO TAKE A BULLET FOR OUR
COUNTRY. SHE SERVED IT DISGUISED AS A MAN
AND GEORGE WASHINGTON'S
CONTINENTAL ARMY. AND SHE FOUGHT TO DEFEND THE DOCUMENTS THAT DID NOT FULLY DEFEND HER. ALL MEN ARE CREATED EQUAL, IT READ. NO MENTION OF WOMEN. AND WHEN SHE TOOK A BLAST AND
BATTLED TO HER LEG SHE WAS AFRAID TO REVEAL HER SECRET. SO SHE TOOK OUT A PEN KNIFE, DUG
OUT THE MUSKET BALL, AND SEWED HERSELF BACK UP AGAIN. THAT IS GRIT. AND GRACE, HILLARY CLINTON HAS
TAKEN SOME FIRE OVER 40 YEARS. HER FIGHT FOR FAMILY AND
CHILDREN.
HOW DID SHE DO IT? THAT IS WHAT I WANT TO KNOW.
WHERE DOES SHE GET HER GRIT AND
HER GRACE?
WHERE DO ANY OF OUR FEMALE FIRST, OUR BREAKERS, WHERE DO THEY FIND THAT STRENGTH QUESTION
MARK SANDRA DAY O'CONNOR, ROSA
PARKS, MALIA AIR HARD, HARRIET
TUBMAN. SALLY RIDE. SHIRLEY CHISHOLM.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] MS. STREEP: MADELEINE ALBRIGHT, GERALDINE FERRARA,
ELEANOR ROOSEVELT. THESE WOMEN SHARE SOMETHING IN
COMMON.
CAPACITY OF MIND. FULLNESS OF HEART.
A BURNING PASSION FOR THEIR
CAUSE. THEY HAVE FORGED NEW PATHS SO THAT OTHERS CAN FOLLOW THEM. MEN AND WOMEN. GENERATION ON GENERATION. THAT IS HILLARY. THAT IS AMERICA.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] MS. STREEP: AND TONIGHT, NEARLY 200 YEARS AFTER DEBORAH SANSOM
FOUGHT AND NEARLY 100 YEARS
AFTER WOMEN GOT THE VOTE, YOU
PEOPLE HAVE MADE HISTORY.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] MS. STREEP: AND YOU ARE GOING
TO MAKE HISTORY AGAIN IN
NOVEMBER BECAUSE HILLARY CLINTON WILL BE OUR FIRST WOMAN PRESIDENT. AND SHE WILL BE A GREAT PRESIDENT. AND SHE WILL BE THE FIRST IN A
LONG LINE OF WOMEN AND MEN WHO SERVE WITH GRIT AND GRACE. SHE WILL BE THE FIRST BUT SHE
WON'T BE THE LAST.</span><span class='hidden-full-transcript-ellipses'>...</span></p><a href='#' class='hidden-full-transcript-link'><i class='icon-chevron-down'></i> <span class='link-show-full-text'>Show Full Text</span><i class='icon-chevron-up'></i> <span class='link-show-less-text'>Show Less Text</span></a>

IT IS WHAT OUR FOUNDING FATHERS
SET OUT TO CREATE 200 40 YEARS AGO.
A UNION BUILT ON SIMPLE BELIEVES THAT ALL<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> MEN ARE CREATED EQUAL WITH A RIGHT TO LIFE, LIBERTY, AND HAPPINESS. BUT WRITING THE THESE WORDS WAS NOT ENOUGH.
EVERY GENERATION WOULD HAVE TO
ACT ON THEM.
WE WOULD ALL NEED TO BE FOUNDERS OF THIS GREAT NATION.
