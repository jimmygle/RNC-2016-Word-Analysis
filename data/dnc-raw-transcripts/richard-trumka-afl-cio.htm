<strong>Lee A. Saunders</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> GOOD EVENING. I AM PROUD TO BE HERE REPRESENTING THE 1.6 MILLION
PUBLIC SERVICE WORKERS. WE KEEP OUR COMMITTEE SAFE AND
STRONG -- OUR COMMUNITY SAFE<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> AND STRONG, PLOWING ROADS AND
ANSWERING 911 CALLS. EVERY DAY IN EVERY WAY, WE FAMILIES -- WE NEVER QUIT PUTTING FAMILIES FIRST. HILLARY CLINTON NEVER QUITS
EITHER. SHE UNDERSTANDS THAT COLLECTIVE BARGAINING RIGHTS STRENGTHEN ALL OF US.
WE NEED A PRESIDENT WHO GETS THAT AND UNDERSTAND THAT BUSTING UNIONS AND CUTTING SERVICES
MEANS FAMILIES SUFFER. LOOK AT FLINT, MICHIGAN, IS POLICIES LED DIRECTLY TO PRESENT DRINKING WATER -- WHERE POISONOUS POLICIES LED DIRECTLY TO PRESOISONED DRINKING WATER.
I WAS IN LAS VEGAS AT THE TRUMP HOTEL LAST WEEK AND THEY VOTED TO FORM A UNION. BUT DONALD TRUMP WILL NOT MEET WITH THEM. IT IS NO SURPRISE, I GUESS.
HOW CAN YOU BE A STRONG WORKER
WHEN YOU ARE FAMOUS FOR THE CATCHPHRASE, YOU ARE FIRED? THIS IS NOT REALITY TELEVISION. THIS IS REALITY. WE NEED A SERIOUS MINDED LEADER WHO PUTS FAMILIES FIRST.
NOT A THIN-SKINNED BULLY WHO PUTS HIMSELF FIRST. UNSTOPPABLE CHAMPION VERSUS AN UNSTABLE CHARLATAN. I KNOW WHAT SIDE I AM ON.
I AM WITH HER. ELECT HILLARY CLINTON THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.

<strong>Richard L. Trumka</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> HELLO, DEMOCRATS.
I AM THE PRESIDENT OF THE AFL-CIO. IT IS GREAT TO BE IN PHILADELPHIA, APRIL CALLED UNIONTOWN -- A PROUD UNIONTOWN. WORKING PEOPLE<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> BUILT THIS STAGE
AND WILL NOW BUILD A NEW ERA OF SHARED PROSPERITY. WORKING PEOPLE ARE STRONG AND DONALD TRUMP IS WRONG, WRONG,
WRONG. LISTEN, HE THINKS HE IS A TOUGH
GUY. DONALD, I WORKED IN THE MINES
WITH TOUGH GUYS.
I KNOW TOUGH GUYS. DONALD, YOU ARE NO TOUGH GUY.
YOU ARE A PHONY. DONALD TRUMP HAS REPEATEDLY OUTSOURCED JOBS TO LINE HIS OWN
POCKETS. HE ROOTED FOR THE HOUSING
COLLAPSE. HE SAID WAGES ARE TOO HIGH --
NOT JUST ONCE, BUT REPEATEDLY. DONALD TRUMP IS NOT THE SOLUTION TO AMERICA'S PROBLEMS.
HE IS THE PROBLEM. WORKING PEOPLE, WE HAVE THE SOLUTION. WE ARE BUILDING A MOVEMENT FOR A BETTER LIFE, NO MATTER THE COLOR
OF OUR SKIN, WHERE WE WERE BORN,
FOR WE LOVE, OR HOW WE WORSHIP. HILLARY CLINTON ANSWERED OUR
CALL. SHE IS FIGHTING TO REWRITE THE
ECONOMIC RULES FOR ALL OF US.
SHE HAS A BOLD PLAN TO INVEST IN MANUFACTURING, INFRASTRUCTURE, AND JOBS. SHE OPPOSES THE JOB KILLING TRANSPACIFIC PARTNERSHIP. SHE WILL PROTECT -- SHE WILL
STAND UP TO WALL STREET AND
FIGHT TO FINALLY SECURE EQUAL A FOR EQUAL WORK -- IT WILL PAY -- EQUAL PAY FOR IT TO WORK. DEMOCRATS, GET ON YOUR FEET, CHANGE THE RULES. LET'S ELECT HILLARY CLINTON THE
NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED
STATES.</span><span class='hidden-full-transcript-ellipses'>...</span></p><a href='#' class='hidden-full-transcript-link'><i class='icon-chevron-down'></i> <span class='link-show-full-text'>Show Full Text</span><i class='icon-chevron-up'></i> <span class='link-show-less-text'>Show Less Text</span></a>

<strong>Lily Eskelsen Garcia</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> WOW.
[SPEAKING SPANISH] I AM HERE BECAUSE I HAVE THE HONOR TO BE REPRESENTING THE 3 MILLION EDUCATORS THAT FORM THE UNION OF THE NATIONAL EDUCATION<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> ASSOCIATION. MY STORY IS NOT DIFFERENT FROM MY STUDENTS STORY. MY MOM IS AN IMMIGRANT AND MY
DAD SERVED IN THE ARMY. MY PARENTS WORKED HARD SO THEIR KIDS COULD HAVE A CHANCE TO GET AHEAD AND THEY WERE SO PROUD OF ME WHEN I BECAME A TEACHER. TODAY, TOO MANY STUDENTS IN OUR
CLASSROOMS FEEL LIKE THEY WILL
NOT GET THE SAME CHANCE I GOT, ESPECIALLY THOSE FROM IMMIGRANT FAMILIES. THEY TELL US THEY ARE AFRAID
THAT THEIR PARENTS MIGHT BE TAKEN AWAY, THAT THEY MIGHT BE DEPORTED FOR NOT HAVING THE RIGHT PIECE OF PAPER. HILLARY CLINTON BELIEVES IN KEEPING FAMILIES TOGETHER. SHE BELIEVES IN OUR DREAMERS. SHE BELIEVES THAT EDUCATORS
SHOULD BE FOCUSED ON EDUCATION, NOT DEPORTATION. DONALD TRUMP SEES THINGS DIFFERENTLY. MY MOM SAYS IF YOU CANNOT SAY
SOMETHING NICE ABOUT SOMEBODY, IT YOU SHOULD AT LEAST MAKE IT
FUNNY. I CANNOT MAKE THIS FUNNY. DONALD TRUMP SEES IMMIGRANTS AS CRIMINALS, DRUG DEALERS
,RAPISTS? HE SAYS HE WOULD ROUND UP
FAMILIES AND UP THEM AND BUILD A WALL -- DEPART THEM AND BUILD THE WALL. WE ARE BETTER THAN THAT. HILLARY CLINTON DOES NOT WANT TO
DIVIDE PEOPLE WITH WALLS OR
HATE. SHE WANTS TO BUILD BRIDGES TO A
BETTER FUTURE FOR ALL OF US. THAT IS WHY AMERICA'S EDUCATORS
ARE WITH HER AND WHY WE WILL DO EVERYTHING IN OUR POWER TO BUILD A BRIDGE TO A FUTURE WHERE HILLARY CLINTON IS THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. GRACIAS.
