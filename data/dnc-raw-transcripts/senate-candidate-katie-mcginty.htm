<strong>Unidentified Speaker</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> HELLO AND THINK YOU FOR JOINING US IN PHILADELPHIA, THE
CITY OF BROTHERLY AND SISTERLY
LOVE. I AM RUNNING FOR UNITED STATES
SENATE HERE IN PENNSYLVANIA.<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> AND I KNOW THAT DURING THESE
LAST FEW DAYS, YOU HAVE SEEN THAT PENNSYLVANIA IS GREAT FOR
THE SAME REASONS AMERICA IS
GREAT, HARD WORK, TIMELESS VALUES, AND THE BELIEVE THAT WE
EACH MUST LOOK OUT FOR EACH OTHER. I WAS RAISED IN PENNSYLVANIA, THE NINTH OF 10 KIDS IN A LOUD IRISH FAMILY.
MY GRANDPARENTS WERE IRISH
IMMIGRANTS. MY PARENTS DIDN'T HAVE COLLEGE
DEGREES. MY DAD WAS A POLICE OFFICER AND
MY MOM WAS A RESTAURANT HOSTESS,
BUT WHEN WE WERE GROWING UP, NONE OF THAT MATTERED. WE LEARN TO LOVE OUR GOD AND OUR
COUNTRY.
WE LEARNED THAT SUCCESS WAS NOT
A PRODUCT OF PEDIGREE. NOW, IF YOU WANT TO SUCCEED, YOU
JUST HAVE TO GIVE IT YOUR ALL. EVERY DAY. AND THEN BE WILLING TO GIVE
BACK.
FOR MY BROTHERS AND SISTERS AND ME, THAT WAS THE DEAL. BUT FOR SO MANY PEOPLE TODAY, THAT DEAL IS OFF THE TABLE. WHY? BECAUSE MIDDLE-CLASS FAMILIES AREN'T MAKING A DIME IN REAL
TERMS MORE THAN THEY WERE TWO
DECADES AGO. BUT WE KNOW COSTS HAVE BEEN
GOING THROUGH THE ROOF. HERE ARE THE FACTS.
WE HAVE THE MOST PRODUCTIVE
ECONOMY IN THE WORLD. BUT THE BENEFITS OF THE PRODUCTIVITY ALL GO TO THE TOP. TOP EXECUTIVES USED TO MAKE 30 TIMES MORE THAN THE AVERAGE GUY
OR GAL. NOW IT'S MORE THAN 300 TIMES. THAT'S WRONG FOR OUR FAMILIES
AND WRONG FOR AMERICA. THE TRUTH IS THAT FEAR AND ANXIETY DO REACH FAR AND WIDE ACROSS THIS COUNTRY. HARD-WORKING PEOPLE ARE FEELING
ANXIOUS AND INSECURE. BUT WE HAVE A CHOICE. OUR CHOICE IS HOW DO WE RESPOND. IT'S ON THE BALLOT THIS
NOVEMBER. WE COULD RESPOND WITH MORE
SCAPEGOATING AND FEAR MONGERING. THAT IS THE TACTIC MY UP -- TACTIC DONALD TRUMP IS USING. BLAME THE MEXICANS.
BLAME THE GOVERNMENT.
BUILD A WALL. DONALD EVEN BLAMED THE POPE. MY IDEA OF OTHER, REST HER SOUL, WOULD BE TURNING IN HER GRAVE ON
THAT ONE. YOU KNOW HE ALSO SAID HANDED
OVER TO WALL STREET. HE MADE HIS MILLIONS ON WALL STREET. AND HE IS STILL TRYING TO SELL
US THE SAME OLD TRICKLE-DOWN. WE ARE NOT BUYING IT. WE KNOW TRICKLE-DOWN ONLY BENEFITS THOSE WHO ARE ALREADY
ON THE TOP. TRUST THE STOCK MARKET WITH YOUR
HARD EARNED SOCIAL SECURITY. TRUST A WHEELERS AND DEALERS AND
YOU WILL BE LIVING LARGE. YOU KNOW WHAT?
WE HAVE SEEN THIS BAD MOVIE AND ALL OF ITS PEOPLE MANY TIMES
BEFORE. THE ENDING IS ALWAYS THE SAME.
THINGS WORK OUT FOR THE BIG SHOTS, AND EVERYONE ELSE, THE AVERAGE JOE, THE AVERAGE JANE,
EVERYONE ELSE GETS STIFFED WITH THE BILL.
WE ALSO HAVE A DIFFERENT CHOICE. WE CAN WORK TOGETHER. WE CAN EXPAND OPPORTUNITY. WE CAN RESPECT EVERY SINGLE PERSON IN THIS COUNTRY. WE CAN BUILD ON THE STRENGTH OF
OUR DIVERSITY AND THE DIVERSITY
OF OUR STRENGTH. YOU KNOW, MY BROTHERS ARE SHE NOT BREEDERS, PRINTERS, CERTIFIED WELDERS.
-- MY BROTHERS ARE MACHINE OPERATORS, PRINTERS, CERTIFIED WELDERS.
THEY KNOW THIS IS A COUNTRY
WHERE WE CAN MAKE STUFF. WE CAN'T, WE MUST, AND WE WILL
WORK FOR GOOD SCHOOLS, -- WE
CAN, WE MUST, AND WE WILL WORK FOR GOOD SCHOOLS, AFFORDABLE COLLEGE, AND JOB TRAINING FOR OUR FAMILIES AND OUR NEIGHBORS TO MAKE AND BUILD THE ECONOMY OF TOMORROW. THIS IS THE AMERICAN WAY.
WORK HARD, GET AHEAD. THIS IS WHAT I WILL FIGHT FOR IN
THE UNITED STATES SENATE, AND
THIS IS WHAT HILLARY CLINTON
WILL FIGHT FOR AND DELIVER FOR
US IN THE WHITE HOUSE.
THANK YOU GOD BLESS AMERICA.
