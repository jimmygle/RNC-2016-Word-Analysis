<strong>Unidentified Speaker</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >>IT IS MY HONOR TO STAND BEFORE YOU TONIGHT AS THE PROUD MEMBER OF THE PROGRESSIVE CALIFORNIA
DELEGATION.
[CHEERS] AND TO ACKNOWLEDGE MY MARYLAND
ROOTS.
[CHEERS]<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> IT IS A PRIVILEGE TO STAND FOR YOU AS THE LEADER OF THE HOUSE
DEMOCRATS. A CAUCUS HONOR TO SERVE WITH OUR PARTNER HARRY LEAD -- HARRY REID, AS PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN AND
ONE OF THE GREATEST PRESIDENT IN OUR HISTORY, PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA.
[CHEERS] TOGETHER, WE PASSED THE
AFFORDABLE CARE ACT, TOGETHER WE PASSED THE LILY LEDBETTER ACT,
INVESTMENT INTO THE RECOVERY ACT,. FRANK -- DODD FRANK, WE
REPEAL DON'T ASK DON'T TELL.
[CHEERS] ONE OF THIS -- MEMO THIS WOULD
HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE WITHOUT THE
COURAGE OF OUR HOUSE DEMOCRATS. WE ARE A CAUCUS PROUD AND WILL FIGHT 21ST CENTURY AMERICA. OVER 50% WOMEN, PEOPLE OF COLOR
AND THE LGBTQ T COMMUNITY.
[CHEERS] WHAT A CONTRAST TO THE RESTRICTED CLUB THAT MET IN THE CONVENTION IN CLEVELAND LAST WEEK. OUR CONVENTION IS DIFFERENT AND
SO IS OUR MISSION. WE COME TO PUBLIC SERVICE AND TO THIS CONVENTION NOT TO TRUMPET DARK THIS, BUT TO FIGHT A WAY FORWARD FOR OUR COUNTRY. WE COME HERE COMFORTED THAT WE ARE APPROACHING A MILESTONE IN
OUR NATIONS HISTORY. THE ELECTION OF THE FIRST WOMAN PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.
[CHEERS] HILLARY CLINTON KNOWS THAT THIS MOMENT IS NOT JUST ABOUT ONE
WOMAN'S ACHIEVEMENT. IT IS ABOUT WHAT ELECTING A
WOMAN PRESIDENT WILL MEAN FOR
ACHIEVING THE DREAMS AND HOPES AND ASPIRATIONS OF EVERY WOMAN,
EVERY DAUGHTER, EVERY SON, EVERY FAMILY ALL ACROSS OUR LAND. FOR GENERATIONS TO COME. THIS MOMENT IS ABOUT THE LANDMARK PROGRESS PRESIDENT CLINTON WILL ACHIEVE FOR FAMILIES EVERYWHERE YEARNING FOR
A BETTER LIFE, A BETTER CHANCE,
AND A BETTER AMERICA. HILLARY CLINTON HAS VISION ROOTED DEEPLY IN DEEPLY HELD VALUES.
SHE HAS A GENUINE STRENGTH THAT SPRINGS PROFOUNDLY THAT CONTRASTS PROPEL ME FROM HER
OPPONENTS BLUSTER. SHE HAS A GIFT FOR STRATEGIC THINKING. FOR KNOWING FROM HER KNOWLEDGE
ENTERS. AND SHE IS CONNECTED TO
HARD-WORKING AMERICAN FAMILIES FORGED IN HER LIFETIME OF LEADERSHIP AND SERVICE TO OTHERS.
[CHEERS] LEADERSHIP AND PUBLIC SERVICE
ARE OUR CAUSES AND COLLINS AS
DEMOCRATS. HERE IS OUR COMMITMENT TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE FOR A STRONGER AMERICA, SECURE THE NATION WITH
STRONG ACTION TO KEEP AMERICANS SAFE FIGHTING TERROR AT HOME AND ABROAD AND ELIMINATING ISIS. WE MUST BE STRONG AND SMART. AT HOME, SAFER COMMUNITIES THE
MAY ENCOURAGE, NOT COWARDICE IN THE FACE OF THE NATIONAL RIFLE
ASSOCIATION. FOR THE SAKE OF THAN ANYONE AMERICANS KILLED BY GUN VIOLENCE EACH DAY, WE MUST BREAK THE GRIP OF THE GUN LOBBY ON CONGRESS AND KEEP GUNS OUT OF THE HANDS OF CRIMINALS AND TERRORISTS. IF YOU ARE ON THE NO-FLY LIST,
THEN YOU BELONG ON THE KNOW BY LIST.
-- NO BUY LIST.
[CHEERS] THAT IS WHY DEMOCRATS, LED BY A NATIONAL ICON, OUR CONGRESSMAN JOHN LEWIS, HELD OUR HISTORIC WHAT THE SIX HOUR SIT IN THE
CAPITAL. AND THEY WON'T STOP UNTIL CONGRESS LISTEN TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND DISARMS HATE. SECONDLY, TO MAKE AMERICA STRONGER, WE MUST SECURE OUR FUTURE, OUR ECONOMIC FUTURE BY
INVESTING IN EDUCATION, INNOVATION AND OPPORTUNITIES. OUR IMPERATIVE IS TO CREATE MORE JOBS AND A LIVING WAGE. WITH EQUAL PAY FOR EQUAL WORK
AND PAID LEAVE FOR EVERYONE SO
THAT EVERY FAMILY CAN EARN THEIR DREAM TO BUY HOME, SEND THEIR CHILDREN TO COLLEGE, RETIREMENT DIGNITY AND NEVER HAVE TO WORRY
THAT THE SOCIAL SECURITY WILL BE PRIVATIZED OR MEDICARE IS GUARANTEES WILL BE TAKEN AWAY.
[CHEERS] AND OUR IMPERATIVE IS QUALITY HEALTH CARE THAT BUILDS ON THE
AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE WHICH NOW COVERS MORE THAN 40 MILLION MORE
AMERICANS. THIRD, FOR A STRONGER AMERICA,
WE MUST SECURE OUR DEMOCRACY BY
REMOVING BARRIERS TO VOTERS AND
DRAINING THE POISONOUS SWAMP OF
SECRET MONEY AND POLITICS. WE DEMOCRATS BELIEVE THAT THE FUTURE OF AMERICA SHOULD BE DECIDED BY THE VOICES OF THE VOTERS, NOT THE POCKETBOOKS OF
THE POWERFUL.
[CHEERS] NOT FAR FROM HERE, OUR FOUNDERS
PLEDGED THEIR LIVES, LIBERTY,
AND THE SACRED HONOR TO CREATE A DEMOCRACY. A GOVERNMENT OF THE MANY, NOT OF
THE MONEY. SO HILLARY CLINTON AND HOUSE DEMOCRATS ARE SWORN TO FREE OUR
DEMOCRACY BY OVERTURNING CITIZENS UNITED.
[CHEERS] THEN, AND ONLY THEN, CAN WE MAKE AMERICA TRULY FAIR. AND ONLY THEN CAN WE HAVE FAIRNESS IN A BUDGET THAT SHOULD
BE A STATEMENT OF OUR NATIONAL VALUES THAT INVESTS IN THE
FUTURE, CREATES JOBS, REDUCES THE DEFICIT AND INSURERS THAT EVERYONE IS PAYING THEIR FAIR
SHARE. FOR AN ECONOMY THAT WORKS FOR
EVERYONE, NOT JUST THE PRIVILEGED FEW.
[CHEERS] WE KNOW WHAT IS ON THE LINE AND WHAT IS THE TRULY MOST IMPORTANT
ELECTION OF THE LIFETIME.
HAS ANYONE EVER SAID THAT HE BEFORE?THE MOST IMPORTANT
ELECTION OF THE LIFETIME. THEY JUST KEEP GETTING MORE AND
MORE IMPORTANT. FOR THE FUTURE OF THE SUPREME
COURT, FOR THE FATE OF A PLANET, FOR THAT SAKE OF IMMIGRATION REFORM, OR THE PROMISE OF AN
AMERICA THAT REWARDS HARD WORK
RATHER THAN REWARDING THOSE WHO
EXPLOIT AMERICA'S WORKERS, FOR WOMEN REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS, EQUAL RIGHTS, CIVIL RIGHTS AND TO DO WHAT IS RIGHT FOR OUR SERVICEMEMBERS, VETERANS AND MILITARY FAMILIES WHO HAVE GIVEN
US SO MUCH. WE WILL STAND AND SPEAK AND CAMPAIGN FOR HILLARY CLINTON AND
TIM KAINE.
[CHEERS] AND THAT TELL YOU THIS, THEY
WILL WIN IN NOVEMBER.
[CHEERS] WE WILL FIGHT TO RESTORE DEMOCRATIC MAJORITIES AND THE
SENATE AND THE HOUSE AND I TELL YOU THIS, WE CAN DO IT.
[CHEERS] ARE YOU READY TO WORK FOR EIGHT GREAT -- A GREAT DEMOCRATIC
VICTORY IN NOVEMBER?
[CHEERS] ARE YOU READY TO MAKE HISTORY BY
ELECTING HILLARY CLINTON,
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES?
[CHEERS] I THOUGHT SO. ONWARD TO VICTORY. GOD BLESS YOU, GOD BLESS OUR MEN
AND WOMEN IN UNIFORM, GOD BLESS AMERICA. THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH.
[CHEERS] ONWARD TO VICTORY.
[CHEERS]
