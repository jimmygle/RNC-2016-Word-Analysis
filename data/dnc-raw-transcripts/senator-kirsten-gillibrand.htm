<strong>Kirsten E. Gillibrand</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> SOME PEOPLE KNOW ME AS A UNITED STATES SENATOR FROM NEW YORK.
[CHEERING] BUT DURING SCHOOL DROP-OFF AND
PICKUP, I'M BETTER KNOWN AS THE L IN HENRY'S<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> MOM.
-- THEO AND HENRY'S WILL. WE ARE FORTUNATE TO HAVE
FLEXIBLE THE, BUT SOME DAYS WE
STILL BARELY KEEP IT TOGETHER. THE VAST MAJORITY OF WORKING
PARENTS HAVE IT MUCH TOUGHER. THEY ARE STRUGGLING WITH TOO
LITTLE TIME, TOO LITTLE MONEY
AND TOO LITTLE SUPPORT. IN WASHINGTON HAS NOT CAUGHT UP
TO THEIR REALITY. FAMILIES TODAY LOOK ALMOST
NOTHING LIKE THEY DID A
GENERATION AGO.
EIGHT IN 10 MOMS WORK OUTSIDE
THE HOME.
FOUR IN 10 MOMS ARE THE PRIMARY
OR SOLE RED WINTER AND MANY ARE
-- BREADWINNER AND MANY ARE
SINGLE. THANKS TO MARRIAGE OF QUALITY, MORE CHILDREN GROW UP WITH TWO MOMS ARE TWO GUYS.
[CHEERING] YET TODAY, OUR POLICIES ARE STUCK IN THE MAD MEN ERA. WE ARE THE ONLY INDUSTRIALIZED NATION THAT DOES NOT HAVE GUARANTEE WORKERS PAID FAMILY
LEAVE. MANY WOMEN CAN'T EVEN GET A PAID
DAY OFF TO GIVE BIRTH. MOST PARENTS WORK OUTSIDE THE
HOME. YET CHILDCARE CAN COST AS MUCH
AS COLLEGE TUITION. FAMILIES RELY ON WOMEN INCOME
BUT WE STILL DON'T HAVE EQUAL PAY FOR EQUAL WORK. THIS MAKES NO SENSE. BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT WHEN
FAMILIES ARE STRONG, AMERICA STRONG. HILLARY CLINTON GETS IT. NOT JUST BECAUSE SHE IS A WORKING MOM, AND GRANDMOTHER, BUT BECAUSE FOR HER IT IS ABOUT
HER CORE VALUES. THE IDEA WE HAVE THAT WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO ONE ANOTHER,
IT IS ABOUT WHO WE ARE AS A NATION. IT IS WHY AFTER LAW SCHOOL, SHE
COULD HAVE GONE TO A FANCY LAW
FIRM, BUT SHE CHOSE TO WORK AT
THE CHILDREN FUND WHERE SHE
ADVOCATED FOR CHILDREN WITH DISABILITIES. IT IS WHY AS AMERICA'S FIRST
LADY, SHE HELPED CREATE A HEALTH
INSURANCE PROGRAM FOR CHILDREN SO THAT 8 MILLION KIDS COULD GET
THE CARE THEY NEED. AND IT IS WHY AS SECRETARY OF STATE, SHE HELPED WOMEN AND CHILDREN TO ESCAPE VIOLENCE AND
POVERTY, TO ATTEND SCHOOLS,
SUPPORT THEIR FAMILIES AND
REINVEST IN THEIR COMMUNITY. IT IS WHY, AS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, SHE WILL BRING OUR WORK IS POLICIES OUT OF THE DARK AGES AND ALWAYS PUT FAMILIES FIRST.
[CHEERING] YOU SEE, HILLARY CLINTON'S LIFE,
HER LIFE WORK HAS BEEN DEFINED
BY ONE QUESTION. HOW CAN WE HELP THOSE WHO NEED
IT THE MOST? DONALD TRUMP HAS BEEN DEFINED BY A VERY DIFFERENT QUESTION. HOW CAN I HELP MYSELF THE MOST? DONALD TRUMP ACTUALLY STOOD ON A DEBATE STAGE AND SAID THAT WAGES ARE TOO HIGH. HILLARY KNOWS THAT IN THE
RICHEST COUNTRY OF THE WORLD, IT IS UNACCEPTABLE THAT A MOM WITH
TWO KIDS WORKING FULL-TIME STILL LIVES IN POVERTY.
[CHEERING] DONALD TRUMP SAYS THAT IT WILL
COME TO PAID FAMILY, YOU HAVE TO
BE CAREFUL OF IT. HILLARY KNOWS THAT IT IS LONG PAST TIME TO HAVE GUARANTEED PAID FAMILY LEAVE.
[CHEERING] DONALD TRUMP THINGS THAT WOMEN
SHOULD JUST WORK HARDER BECAUSE, AND I'M QUOTING, YOU ARE GOING
TO MAKE THE SAME IF YOU DO AS
GOOD OF A JOB. EVERY WOMAN IN AMERICA KNOWS THAT IS NOT TRUE. HILLARY BELIEVES WOMEN DESERVE EQUAL PAY FOR EQUAL WORK.
[CHEERING] THE CHOICE IN THIS ELECTION
COULD NOT BE CLEARER. IF YOU BELIEVE IN THE VALUES THAT HAVE ALWAYS MADE US GREAT, IF YOU BELIEVE IN KEEPING
AMERICA GREAT, THEN SUPPORT HILLARY CLINTON. THANK YOU AND GOD BLESS THIS
GREAT NATION.
