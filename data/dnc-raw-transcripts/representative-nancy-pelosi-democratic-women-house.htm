<strong>Nancy Pelosi</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> MS. PELOSI: GOOD EVENING,
EVERYONE. IN 1776, NOT FAR FROM HERE, THE
FOUNDING FATHERS CREATED OUR NATION, 96 YEARS BEFORE WOMEN
WON THE RIGHT TO VOTE.
WE<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> ARE PREPARING TO SHATTER THE
HIGHEST CLASS HEALING IN OUR
COUNTRY -- GLASS CEILING IN OUR COUNTRY BY ELECTING HILLARY
CLINTON PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED
STATES. AREN'T YOU PROUD TO BE PART OF
THIS HISTORIC MOMENT IN OUR HISTORY? HILLARY CLINTON KNOWS THAT THIS
IS NOT JUST ABOUT ONE WOMAN'S ACHIEVEMENT, BUT WHAT A WOMAN
PRESIDENT WILL MEAN FOR THE HOPES, DREAMS, AND ASPIRATIONS
OF EVERY WOMAN, EVERY SON, AND
EVERY DAUGHTER ACROSS THE LAND
FOR GENERATIONS TO COME. THE DEMOCRATIC WOMEN OF THE
HOUSE ARE LEADING THE WAY TO
UNLEASH THE POWER OF AMERICA'S
WOMEN AND WORKING EMILY'S IN OUR ECONOMY -- FAMILIES IN OUR ECONOMY, IN OUR SOCIETY, AND IN OUR DEMOCRACY.
NOTHING IS MORE WHOLESOME FOR
AMERICA THAN THE INCREASED
PARTICIPATION AND LEADERSHIP OF
WOMEN IN GOVERNMENT AND
POLITICS. HERE TONIGHT ARE WOMEN WHO PERSONIFY THE INTEGRITY, IMAGINATION, IDEALISM, AND INDEED, THE COURAGE THAT WILL
BUILD A STRONGER AMERICA FOR
HARD-WORKING FAMILIES. AS HILLARY CLINTON DID, THEY
HAVE SPENT THEIR LIFETIME
FIGHTING FOR WOMEN AND CHILDREN. AND IN NOVEMBER, WE WILL AFFIRM THE GREAT TRUTH OF OUR COUNTRY,
WHEN WOMEN SUCCEED, AMERICA
SUCCEEDS.</span><span class='hidden-full-transcript-ellipses'>...</span></p><a href='#' class='hidden-full-transcript-link'><i class='icon-chevron-down'></i> <span class='link-show-full-text'>Show Full Text</span><i class='icon-chevron-up'></i> <span class='link-show-less-text'>Show Less Text</span></a>

MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER TO THE

ILLINOIS, THE BIRTHPLACE OF
HILLARY CLINTON. HILLARY CLINTON AND HOUSE DEMOCRATS BELIEVE A STRONGER
AMERICA MEANS PROTECTING<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> WOMEN'S RIGHTS AND EXPANDING WOMEN'S
OPPORTUNITIES. DONALD TRUMP AND REPUBLICANS IN CONGRESS HAVE OTHER PRIORITIES,
MEDDLING IN WOMEN'S MOST
INTIMATE DECISIONS. JEOPARDIZING WOMEN'S HEALTH. EVEN CRIMINALIZING WOMEN'S
CHOICES. WHEN IT COMES TO THE ISSUES
BETWEEN WOMEN AND THEIR DOCTORS, HOUSE REPUBLICANS MISREPRESENT, THEY INTIMIDATE, AND THEY UNDERMINE. IN CONGRESS ALONE, THEY HAVE
VOTED 14 TIMES TO ATTACK WOMEN'S HEALTH. REPUBLICANS CONTINUE TO ATTACK THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT WHICH HAS PROVIDED NEW FOUND HEALTH SECURITY TO MILLIONS OF
AMERICANS. BECAUSE OF HEALTH CARE REFORM,
NO LONGER CAN INSURANCE
COMPANIES CHARGE YOU MORE JUST BECAUSE YOU ARE A WOMAN, AND FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HISTORY, NO LONGER IS BEING A WOMAN A PRE-EXISTING CONDITION. DEMOCRATS ARE FIGHTING BACK AGAINST THE REPUBLICAN ANTI-WOMAN CRUSADE. IT'S 2016, AND AMERICAN WOMEN
ARE NOT GOING BACK, WE ARE
