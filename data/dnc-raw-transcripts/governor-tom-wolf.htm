<strong>Unidentified Speaker</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> THANK YOU. AS GOVERNOR OF PENNSYLVANIA, IT
HAS BEEN AN HONOR TO HOST YOU HERE IN PHILADELPHIA THIS WEEK.
[CHEERS] TWO YEARS AGO, IRAN FOR GOVERNOR
ON<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> THE FUNDAMENTAL BELIEF THAT
SOCIETY CAN ONLY EXCEED WHEN WE BUILD PROSPERITY AND SHARED
BROADLY. THIS WAS NOT A LESSON I LEARNED
IN POLITICS. IT WAS A LESSON I LEARNED IN
BUSINESS. AFTER SERVING IN THE PEACE CORPS IN EARNING A PHD AT M.I.T., I
SURPRISED MY FAMILY AND FRIENDS
BY COMING HOME TO CENTRAL PENNSYLVANIA TO WORK IN THE
FAMILY BUSINESS. A BUILDING THAT GOES COMPANY
WHERE I STARTED OUT DRIVING A
FORKLIFT. EVENTUALLY I BOUGHT THE COMPANY
ALONG WITH TWO OF MY COUSINS AND
WE BECAME ONE OF THE LARGEST SUPPLIERS OF KITCHEN CABINETS IN
NORTH AMERICA. ONE OF THE KEYS TO OUR SUCCESS
WAS THAT WE RECOGNIZED IN BUSINESS YOU ARE ONLY AS GOOD AS
THE PEOPLE YOU HAVE IN YOUR
COMPANY. PLUS, YOU HAD TO TREAT EVERYONE LIKE THEY MATTER.
WHY? BECAUSE THEY DO MATTER. I UNDERSTAND THAT NOT ALL
BUSINESSPEOPLE SEE IT THIS WAY. WHEN WE CONTRACTED WITH A
VENDOR, WE PAID THAT VENDOR. DONALD TRUMP, HE STIFFED
HUNDREDS OF SMALL BUSINESSES
FROM PLUMBERS TO PAINTERS,
RUINING THE COMPANIES AS HE
ENRICHED HIMSELF. OUR COMPANY, LIKE MANY OTHERS
ACROSS THIS NATION, WE TREAT OUR EMPLOYEES WITH RESPECT.
WHEN THEY HAD KIDS, WE
CELEBRATED THEM.
AND WE GET NEW MOMS PAID LEAVE.
[CHEERS] DONALD TRUMP SAYS PREGNANT WORKERS ARE AN INCONVENIENCE. IT IS A SURPRISE THAT HE HAS PUT
FORWARD NO PLAN FOR PAID FAMILY
LEAVE. FINALLY, ANOTHER IMPORTANT PART
OF OUR MODEL IS THAT WE HAD A
PROBLEM SHARING PLAN. WE KNEW THAT OUR EMPLOYEES CONTRIBUTE TO OUR GROWTH SO IN
ADDITION TO GOOD WAGES, GOOD FAMILIES SUSTAINING WAGES AND BENEFITS WE SHARE BETWEEN 20 AND
30% OF OUR PROFITS WITH OUR
EMPLOYEES DIRECTLY.
[CHEERS] JUST TO GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE, AND
2013, A TURNAROUND YEAR FOR OUR COMPANY, ALL OF OUR WORKERS,
HUNDREDS OF THEM RECEIVED AN AVERAGE OF $5,000 EACH AND PROFIT SHARING THAT THEY COULD
USE FOR COLLEGE TUITION, A WELL-EARNED VACATION OR THEY
COULD SPEND IT ON ANYTHING ELSE
THEY WANTED.
[CHEERS] HOW ABOUT DONALD TRUMP? HE RUNS HIS BUSINESSES SO THAT
THEY ONLY HELP DONALD TRUMP. IN HIS FACE BANKRUPTCY FILINGS,
HE IS THE PROCESS TO CHECK
HIMSELF AND ENRICH HIMSELF WHILE
HIS EMPLOYEES WERE LEFT OUT OF LUCK. WE DO NOT DO WHAT WE DID CONSUMER LOOKING FOR REWARDS, WE
DID IT BECAUSE IT WAS THE RIGHT
THING TO DO FOR OUR WORKERS AND
WE DID IT BECAUSE IT WAS GREAT
FOR OUR COMPANY'S BOTTOM LINE. IT WAS MORE PROCESS, PLAIN AND
SIMPLE. WE WERE A STRONGER, MORE
SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS BECAUSE WE
WERE ALL IN IT TOGETHER. HILLARY CLINTON BELIEVES THAT
ALSO. THAT IS WHY AS PRESIDENT,
HILLARY CLINTON WILL REWARD COMPANIES THAT SHARE PROFITS WITH EMPLOYEES, NOT JUST
EXECUTIVES. ON HER PROPOSAL, COMPANIES WILL GET TAX CREDITS WORTH 50% OF THE
PROFITS THEY SHARE WITH THE EMPLOYEES. THE CREDITS WOULD LAST TWO YEARS
AND BE LARGER FOR SMALL
BUSINESSES BECAUSE HILLARY
BELIEVES IF YOU WORK HARD, YOU CAN SHARE IN YOUR COMPANY
SUCCESS.
[CHEERS] SHE WILL ALSO FIGHT TO RAISE THE MINIMUM WAGE.
SHE WILL ENSURE EQUAL PAY FOR
WOMEN AND GUARANTEE THAT THE 12
WEEKS PAID FAMILY LEAVE.
[CHEERS] PLUS AFFORDABLE CHILDCARE. THAT IS FAIR, SMART AND GREAT
FOR OUR ECONOMY BECAUSE IT IS
GOOD FOR WORKERS AND IT IS GOOD
FOR BUSINESSES.
AT THIS MOMENT, WHEN WE NEED TO
RESTORE THE FUNDAMENTAL AMERICAN
IDEA THAT IF YOU WORK HARD, YOU CAN GET AHEAD AND STAY THERE, WE NEED A PRESIDENT WHO RECOGNIZES
THAT AN ECONOMY THAT DOES NOT
WORK OR EVERYONE DOESN'T WORK AT
ALL. WE NEED A PRESIDENT WHO BELIEVES THAT OUR SOCIETY CAN ONLY SUCCEED WHEN ECONOMIC PROSPERITY
IS SHARED BROADLY. WE NEED HILLARY CLINTON.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
