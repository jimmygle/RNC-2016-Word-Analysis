[APPLAUSE] SENATOR MIKULSKI, AND 1987, I WAS THE FIRST DEMOCRATIC WOMAN
ELECTED TO THE SENATE<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> AND HER OWN RIGHT. I WANTED MORE WOMEN SO WE COULD
LIGHT A TORCH AND LIGHTEN THE
LOAD FOR ALL OF YOU. AND OUR RANKS HAVE GROWN. I HAVE HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF MENTORING SO MANY WOMEN, AND IN
2000, I GOT A CALL FROM ONE OF
THEM. SHE WAS CONSIDERING A SENATE
RUN, BUT SHE HAD ONE QUESTION -- SHE ASKED ME IF A SENATOR COULD
REALLY GET HIS ON.
I TOLD HER A LOT, AND BOY, DID SHE PROVE ME RIGHT.
AS A SENATOR, SHE CHAMPIONED THE ECONOMIC SECURITY OF AMERICAN FAMILIES. WHEN REPUBLICANS TRIED TO TURN
OVER SOCIAL SECURITY TOO BIG
BANKS, SHE HELPED DELIVER A
KNOCKOUT VOTE.
AND WHEN THE SUPREME COURT TOLD
LOUIE LEDBETTER NO WAY ON EQUAL PAY, SHE PUSHED FOR THE FAIR PAY ACT TO GUARANTEE EQUAL PAY FOR
EQUAL WORK. I FINISHED THAT JOB, AND THE
FAIR PAY ACT WAS THE FIRST BILL BARACK OBAMA SIGNED INTO LAW. HER NAME IS HILLARY CLINTON, AND
SHE IS GOING TO BE OUR NEXT
PRESIDENT.
