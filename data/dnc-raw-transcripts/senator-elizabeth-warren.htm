<strong>Joseph "Joe" P. Kennedy III</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> THANK YOU. THANK YOU THANK YOU.
[CHEERING] MY FIRST DAY OF LAW SCHOOL, MY
VERY FIRST CLASS, THE GOAL
ESCAPE UNSCATHED. NOT THREE SECONDS IN, AND I<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> GET THE FIRST QUESTION. MR. KENNEDY, WHAT IS THE DEFINITION OF A SUBSET? UHH. YOU REALIZE IT IS THE FIRST WORD
IN YOUR READING? YEAH. I CIRCLED IT COVETED NOT KNOW
WHAT IT MEANT.
-- BECAUSE I DID NOT KNOW WHAT
IT MEANT.
DO YOU HAVE A DICTIONARY? THAT IS WHAT PEOPLE DO WHEN THEY
DON'T KNOW WHAT A WORD MEANS. I NEVER SHOWED UP UNPREPARED FOR
PROFESSOR ELIZABETH WARREN EVER AGAIN.
[CHEERING] SHE WAS THE TOUGHEST TEACHER ON CAMPUS BUT THE WAIT LIST FOR HER
CLASS WAS A MILE LONG.
SHE PUSHED US HARD, SHE BROUGHT OUT OUR BEST AND SHE BELIEVED IN US AND SHE BELIEVED IN THE LAW.
NOT AS AN ABSTRACTION, BUT AS A
LIVING FORCE WITH THE POWER TO
MAKE LIFE BETTER OR WORSE. SHE TAUGHT US IN THE SOCIETY FOR
WAGES HAD NOT BUDGED IN 40
YEARS. WHERE 2.5 MILLING CHILDREN ARE
HOMELESS. WHERE WE CAN EXPECT ONE IN THREE BLACK MEN TO GO TO PRISON. OUR LAWS HAVE HUMAN CONSEQUENCES. THAT FUELED A LOGICAL PROFESSOR TO TAKE ON THIS COUNTRY'S MOST
ENTRENCHED FINANCIAL INTEREST. BROUGHT MIDDLE CLASS CHAMPION
BACK TO A MESSAGE TO -- MASSACHUSETTS SENATOR. AND IT LET A FIRST-TERM SENATOR
BECOME OUR GOVERNMENT THAT
CHECK. A SEA OF POWER AND PRIVILEGE, AND ANCHOR FOR THE VOICELESS AND
THE DEMISE. SHE ASKS MORE FROM ALL THOSE
BECAUSE SHE BELIEVES DEEPLY IN
EACH OF US. THAT FAITH IN OUR COUNTRY AND
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE IS THE VERY
FOUNDATION OF OUR CREDIT PARTY.
-- DEMOCRATIC ALREADY.
IT ECHOES THROUGH THE ARENA TONIGHT AND EVERY CLASSROOM, LIVING ROOM, THAT SENATOR WARREN
HAS EVER TOUCHED. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, IT IS MY HONOR TO INTRODUCE TO YOU, YOUR SENATOR, MY SENATOR, OUR SENATOR
SENATOR ELIZABETH WARREN.

<strong>Elizabeth Warren</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> THANK YOU. THANK YOU MASSACHUSETTS FOR THE
GREAT HONOR OF SERVING AS YOUR SENATOR.
THANK YOU.
[CHEERING] WHAT A NIGHT. WOW. MICHELLE OBAMA, CORY BOOKER.
[CHEERING]<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> AND WE STILL HAVE BURNING COMING
UP.
-- BERNIE COMING UP.
[CHEERING] BERNIE REMINDS US WHAT DEMOCRATS
FIGHT FOR EVERY DAY. THANK YOU, BERNIE.
[CHEERING] WE ARE HERE TONIGHT BECAUSE AMERICA FACES A CHOICE. THE CHOICE OF A NEW PRESIDENT. ON ONE SIDE, A MAN WHO INHERITED
A FORTUNE FROM HIS FATHER AND KEPT IT GOING BY TEACHING PEOPLE, WHY SKIPPING OUT ON
THAT. A MAN WHO HAS NEVER SACRIFICED ANYTHING FOR ANYONE.
A MAN WHO CARES ONLY FOR HIMSELF
, EVERY MINUTE OF EVERY DAY. ON THE OTHER SIDE, IT'S ONE OF THOSE SMARTEST, TOUGHEST, MOST
TENACIOUS PEOPLE ON THIS PLANET, A WOMAN WHO BUY FOR CHILDREN,
WOMEN, HEALTH CARE, HUMAN
RIGHTS.
A WOMAN WHO FIGHTS FOR ALL OF US IT IS STRONG ENOUGH TO WIN THIS
FIGHT.
[CHEERING] WE ARE HERE TODAY BECAUSE OUR CHOICE IS HILLARY CLINTON. I'M WITH HILLARY.
[CHEERING] I'M WITH HILLARY.
[CHEERING] FOR ME, THIS CHOICE IS PERSONAL. IT IS ABOUT WHO WE ARE AS A PEOPLE, WHAT KIND OF A COUNTRY
WE WANT TO BE. I GREW UP IN OKLAHOMA. MY DADDY ENDED UP AS A
MAINTENANCE MAN. MY MOM WORKED A MINIMUM WAGE
JOB. MY THREE BROTHERS SERVED IN THE
MILITARY. THE OLDEST WAS A CAREER, 288,
MISSIONS. THE SECOND, CONSTRUCTION. THE THIRD STARTED HIS OWN SMALL
BUSINESS. I GOT MARRIED AT 19, GRADUATED
FROM A COMMUTER COLLEGE IN TEXAS THAT COST $50 A SEMESTER.
[CHEERING] THE WAY I SEE IT, I'M A
JANITOR'S DAUGHTER BECAME A PUBLIC SCHOOL TEACHER, A PROFESSOR IN THE UNITED STATES
SENATOR. AMERICA IS TRULY A COUNTRY OF
OPPORTUNITY.
[CHEERING] I'M DEEPLY GRATEFUL TO THAT AMERICA. I BELIEVE IN THAT AMERICA. BUT I'M WORRIED. I'M WORRIED THAT MY STORY IS
LOCKED IN THE PAST. WORRIED THAT OPPORTUNITY IS
SLIPPING AWAY FOR PEOPLE WHO WORK HARD AND PLAY BY THE RULES. LOOK AROUND. AMERICANS THAT THEIR TAIL, SOME
WORKING TWO OR THREE JOBS. WAGES STAY FLAT. MEANWHILE, THE BASIC COST OF
MAKING A MONTH-TO-MONTH KEEPS
GOING UP. HOUSING, HEALTH CARE, CHILD
CARE. THE COST ARE OUT OF SIGHT. YOUNG PEOPLE ARE GETTING CRUSHED
BY STUDENT LOANS. WORKING PEOPLE ARE IN DEBT. SENIORS CAN'T STRETCH A SOCIAL SECURITY CHECK TO COVER THE BASICS AND EVEN FAMILIES WHO ARE
OK TODAY WORRY THAT IT COULD ALL FALL APART TOMORROW. THIS IS NOT RIGHT.
[CHEERING] IT IS NOT. HERE'S THE THING, AMERICA IS NOT
GOING BROKE. THE STOCK MARKET IS BREAKING
RECORDS. CORPORATE PROFITS ARE AT
ALL-TIME HIGHS. CEOS MAKE TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. THERE IS LIGHT LOT OF WEALTH IN AMERICA BUT IT IS NOT TRICKLING DOWN TO HARD-WORKING FAMILIES LIKE YOURS.
[CHEERING] DOES ANYONE HERE HAVE A PROBLEM
WITH THAT?
[CHEERING] I DO TOO! PEOPLE GET IT. THE SYSTEM IS RIGGED.
[CHEERING] IT IS TRUE. SO-CALLED EXPERTS CLAIM AMERICA
IS IN TROUBLE BECAUSE BOTH
POLITICAL PARTIES IN WASHINGTON REFUSED TO COMPROMISE. GRIDLOCK. THAT IS JUST WRONG.
[CHEERING] WASHINGTON WORKS GREAT FOR THOSE
AT THE TOP. WHEN JACK COMPANIES WANT MORE TAX LOOPHOLES, WASHINGTON GOT IT
DONE. WHEN HUGE ENERGY COMPANIES
WANTED TO TEAR UP OUR DEPARTMENT, WASHINGTON GOT IT DONE.
WHEN AN ENORMOUS WALL STREET BREAKS WANTED LOOPHOLES,
WASHINGTON GOT IT DONE.
NO GRIDLOCK THERE. BUT TRY TO DO SOMETHING,
ANYTHING FOR WORKING PEOPLE, YOU
WILL HAVE A FIGHT ON YOUR HANDS. DEMOCRATS HAVE TAKEN ON THOSE BITES.
THAT IS WHAT WE DO.
[CHEERING] DEMOCRATS FOUGHT TO GET HEALTH INSURANCE FOR MORE AMERICANS.
THE REGRETS BUT FOR A STRONG
CONSUMER AGENCY SO BIG BANKS CAN'T KEEP -- CHEAT PEOPLE. WE IMPROVE THE LIVES OF MILLIONS
OF PEOPLE. THANK YOU, BARACK OBAMA.
[CHEERING] YES, WE WON BUT REPUBLICANS AND LOBBYISTS BATTLED US EVERY STEP OF THE WAY. FIVE YEARS LATER, THAT CONSUMER AGENCY HAS RETURNED $11 BILLION
TO FAMILIES WHO WERE TREATED -- CHEATED AND REPUBLICANS, THEY ARE STILL TRYING TO KILL IT. I'M NOT SOMEONE WHO THINKS THAT REPUBLICANS ARE ALWAYS WRONG AND
DEMOCRATS ARE ALWAYS RIGHT.
THERE IS ENOUGH BLAME TO GO
AROUND.
BUT THERE IS A HUGE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PEOPLE FIGHTING FOR A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD AND THE PEOPLE FIGHTING TO KEEP THE
SYSTEM RIGGED.
[CHEERING] LOOK AT CONGRESS. SINCE THE REPUBLICANS TOOK OVER. DEMOCRATS PROPOSE REFINANCING STUDENT LOANS. AND REPUBLICANS SAID NO. DEMOCRATS PROPOSED ENDING TAX
BREAKS FOR CORPORATIONS THAT
SHIP JOBS OVERSEAS. REPUBLICANS SAID NO. DEMOCRATS OPPOSED RAISING THE
MINIMUM WAGE AND REPUBLICANS,
THEY SAID NO. TO EVERY REPUBLICAN IN CONGRESS WHO SAID NO, THIS NOVEMBER, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE COMING FOR
YOU.
[CHEERING] THAT IS RIGHT.
[CHEERING] WHERE WAS DONALD TRUMP AND ALL
OF THESE BITES -- FIGHTS? NOT ONCE DID HE LIVED A FINGER TO HELP WORKING PEOPLE. AND WHY WOULD HE? HIS WHOLE LIFE HAS BEEN ABOUT
TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THAT RIGGED
SYSTEM. TIME AFTER TIME, HE PRAYED ON WORKING PEOPLE PEOPLE IN DEBT. IT THAT FOLLOWED ON HARD TIMES. HE THE FRAUD AT THEM AND HE HAS
RIPPED THEM OFF. LOOK AT HIS HISTORY. DONALD TRUMP SAID HE WAS EXCITED
FOR THE 2008 HOUSING CRASH THAT DEVASTATED MILLIONS OF AMERICANS
BECAUSE HE THOUGHT IT WOULD HELP HIM GET MORE REAL ESTATE ON THE CHEAP. DONALD TRUMP SET UP A FAKE UNIVERSITY TO MAKE MONEY BY TEACHING PEOPLE AND TAKING THEIR
LIFE SAVINGS. DONALD TRUMP GOES ON AND ON AND ON. ABOUT BEING A SUCCESSFUL BUSINESSMAN, BY FILING THIS IS
BANKRUPTCY SIX TIMES, ALWAYS TO
PROTECT HIS OWN MONEY AND STICK
THE INVESTORS AND CONTRACTORS
WITH THE BILLS.
>> BOO!
>> DONALD TRUMP HIRED CONSTRUCTION WORKERS AND
PAINTERS TO DO HARD LABOR FOR HIS BUSINESSES AND THAT HE TOLD THEM, YOU GET ONLY A FRACTION OF
WHAT HE OWES AND FIGHTS THE
LAWYERS AND COURTS FOR YEARS.
>> BOO!
>> WHAT KIND OF A MAN ACTS LIKE THAT? WHAT KIND OF A MAN ROOTS FOR AN ECONOMIC CRASH THAT COST
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE THEIR JOBS,
THEIR HOMES, THEIR LIFE SAVINGS? WHAT KIND OF A MAN CHEATS
STUDENTS AND INVESTORS AND WORKERS? I WILL TELL YOU WHAT KIND OF A MAN.
A MAN WHO MUST NEVER BE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.
[CHEERING] NEVER.
[CHEERING] AND WE'VE GOT THE LEADERS TO
MAKE IT HAPPEN. HILLARY CLINTON AND TIM KAINE.
[CHEERING] DONALD TRUMP KNOWS THAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE ANGRY. A FACT SO OBVIOUS HE CAN SEE IT
FROM THE TOP OF THE TRUMP TOWER. SO NOW, HE IS INSISTING THAT HE,
AND HE ALONE CAN FIX THE RIGGED SYSTEM. LAST WEEK, DONALD TRUMP SPOKE
FOR MORE THAN AN HOUR ON THE
BIGGEST STAGE HE HAS EVER HAD,
BUT OTHER THAN TALKING ABOUT
BUILDING A STUPID WALL, WHICH
WILL NEVER GET BUILT -- 
[LAUGHTER] OTHER THAN THAT WALL, DID YOU HEAR ANYTHING, ANY ACTUAL IDEAS?
>> NO!
>> DID YOU HEAR EVEN ONE SOLID PROPOSAL FROM TRUMP TO INCREASE INCOME OR IMPROVING YOUR KIDS EDUCATION? OR CREATING EVEN ONE SINGLE GOOD
PAYING JOB?
>> NO!
>> LET'S FACE IT, DONALD TRUMP HAS NO REAL PLANS FOR COLLEGE KIDS OR FOR SENIORS. NO PLANS TO MAKE ANYTHING GREAT
FOR ANYONE. EXCEPT RICH GUYS LIKE DONALD
TRUMP. JUST LOOK AT HIS IDEAS. DONALD TRUMP WAS TO GET RID OF
THE FEDERAL MINIMUM WAGE. DONALD TRUMP WANTS TO ROLL BACK FINANCIAL REGULATIONS AND TURNED
WALL STREET LOOSE TO WRECK OUR
ECONOMY AGAIN. IT DONALD TRUMP HAS A TAX PLAN
THAT GIVES MULTIMILLIONAIRES AND
BILLIONAIRES LIKE HIMSELF AN
AVERAGE TAX CUT OF $1.3 MILLION A YEAR.
>> BOO!
>> IF YOU ARE STRUGGLING TO PUT YOUR KID THIRD COLLEGE AND
DONALD TRUMP THINKS HE NEEDS A
MILLION-DOLLAR TAX BREAK, DON'T
TOUCH ENTIRE CAMPAIGN IS JUST
ONE MORE LATE-NIGHT TRUMP INFOMERCIAL. HAND OVER YOUR MONEY, YOUR JOB,
YOUR CHILDREN'S FUTURE AND THAT
TRUMP AUDIO MACHINE WILL REVEAL
ALL THE ANSWERS [CHEERING]
.
[CHEERING] AND FOR ONE LOW PRICE, HE WILL EVEN THROW IN A JUICY HAD -- GOOFY HAT.
[LAUGHTER] HERE IS THE REALLY UGLY UNDERSIDE TO HIS PITCH, TRUMP
THINKS HE CAN WIN VOTES BY
FANNING THE FLAMES OF FEAR AND
HATRED. BY TURNING NEIGHBOR AGAINST
NEIGHBOR. BY PERSUADING YOU THAT THE REAL
PROBLEM IN AMERICA IS YOUR FELLOW AMERICANS. PEOPLE WHO DON'T LOOK OR TALK
LIKE YOU OR DON'T WORSHIP LIKE
YOU. HE EVEN PICK THE VICE PRESIDENT FAMOUS FOR TRYING TO MAKE IT LEGAL TO OPENLY DISCRIMINATE AGAINST GAYS AND LESBIANS.
>> BOO!
>> THAT IT DONALD TRUMP TO
AMERICA.
AND AMERICA HERE AND HATE. AN AMERICA WHERE WE BREAK APART. WHITE AGAINST BLACKS AND
LATINOS.
CHRISTIANS AGAINST MUSLIMS AND
JEWS.
STRAIGHT AGAINST DAY.
EVERYONE AGAINST IMMIGRANTS. RACE, RELIGION, HERITAGE,
GENDER, THE MORE FACTIONS THE
BETTER. BUT ASK YOURSELF THIS, WHEN
WHITE LAKERS -- WHAT WORKERS IN OHIO ARE PITTED AGAINST BLACK
WORKERS IN NORTH CAROLINA OR
LATINO WORKERS IN FLORIDA, WHO REALLY BENEFITS? DIVIDE AND CONQUER IS AN OLD
STORY IN AMERICA. DR. MARTIN LUTHER KING KNEW IT. AFTER HIS MARCH FROM SELMA TO MONTGOMERY, HE SPOKE ABOUT HOW
SEGREGATION WAS CREATED TO KEEP
PEOPLE DIVIDED. INSTEAD OF HIGHER WAGES FOR WORKERS, DR. KING DESCRIBED HOW POOR WHITE IN THE SOUTH WERE FED JIM CROW WHICH TOLD OF POOR WHITE WORKER THAT NO MATTER HOW
BAD OFF YOU ARE, AT LEAST HE WAS
A WHITE MAN BETTER THAN THE BLACK MAN. RACIAL HATRED WAS PART OF KEEPING THE POWERFUL ON TOP.
[CHEERING] WHEN WE TURN ON EACH OTHER, ANCHORS CAN RUN OUR ECONOMY FROM
WALL STREET.
OIL COMPANIES CAN FIGHT OFF LINN
ENERGY. GIANT CORPORATIONS CAN SHIP THE
LAST GOOD JOBS OVERSEAS. WHEN WE TURN ON EACH OTHER, RICH
GUYS LIKE TRUMP CAN PUSH THROUGH
MORE TAX BREAKS FOR THEMSELVES
AND THEN WE WILL NEVER HAVE
ENOUGH MONEY TO SUPPORT OUR SCHOOLS, OR REBUILD OUR HIGHWAYS OR REINVEST IN THE KIDS FUTURES. WHEN WE TURN ON EACH OTHER, WE CAN'T UNITE TO FIGHT BACK AGAINST A RIGGED SYSTEM.
[CHEERING] I'VE GOT NEWS FOR DONALD TRUMP,
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE NOT
FALLING FOR IT.
[CHEERING] WE HAVE SEEN THIS UGLINESS BEFORE AND WE ARE NOT GOING TO BE DONALD TRUMP'S HATE FILLED
AMERICA, NOT NOW, NOT EVER.
[CHEERING] THIS IS ABOUT OUR VALUES. ABOUT OUR SHARED VALUES WITH OUR CANDIDATE HILLARY CLINTON AND
TIM KAINE.
[CHEERING] LET'S TALK ABOUT THOSE VALUES. WE BELIEVE THAT NO MATTER WHO
YOU ARE, NO MATTER WHERE YOU ARE FROM, NO MATTER WHO YOU LOVE,
EQUAL MEANS EQUAL. HILLARY WILL FIGHT TO MAKE SURE
DISCRIMINATION HAS NO PLACE IN AMERICA AND WE ARE WITH HER.
[CHEERING] WE BELIEVE THAT NO ONE WHO WORKS
FULL-TIME SHOULD LIVE IN
POVERTY. HILLARY WILL FIGHT FOR RAISING THE MINIMUM WAGE, OR SCHEDULING,
PAID FAMILY AND MEDICAL LEAVE
AND WE ARE WITH HER.
[CHEERING] WE BELIEVE EVERY KID IN AMERICA SHOULD HAVE A CHANCE FOR A GREAT EDUCATION WITHOUT GETTING
CRUSHED BY DEBT. HILLARY WILL FIGHT FOR
REFINANCING STUDENT LOANS AND
DEBT FREE COLLEGE. WE ARE WITH HER.
[CHEERING] AND WE BELIEVE THAT AFTER A
LIFETIME OF HARD WORK, SENIORS
SHOULD BE ABLE TO RETIRE WITH
DIGNITY. HILLARY WILL FIGHT TO EXPAND SOCIAL SECURITY, MEDICARE, AND
PROTECT OUR RETIREMENT ACCOUNT AND WE ARE WITH HER.
[CHEERING] WE BELIEVE THAT OIL COMPANIES SHOULD NOT CALL THE SHOTS IN WASHINGTON. THAT SCIENCE MATTERS, THAT
CLIMATE CHANGE IS REAL.
[CHEERING] HILLARY WILL FIGHT TO PRESERVE
THIS EARTH FOR OUR CHILDREN AND
GRANDCHILDREN AND WE ARE WITH
HER.
[CHEERING] WE BELIEVE, AND I CAN'T BELIEVE I HAVE TO SAY THIS IN 2016, IN EQUAL PAY FOR EQUAL WORK AND A WARM AND -- WOMAN'S RIGHT TO
CONTROL OVER HER OWN BODY. HILLARY WILL FIGHT FOR WOMEN AND
WE ARE WITH HER.
[CHEERING] WE BELIEVE WE DON'T NEED WEAKER
ROLLS ON WALL STREET, WE NEED
STRONGER RULES AND WHEN BIG BANKS GET TOO RISKY, BREAK THEM
UP. HILLARY WILL FIGHT TO HOLD BIG
BANK ACCOUNTABLE AND WE ARE WITH
HER.
[CHEERING] AND WE BELIEVE THAT THE UNITED STATES SHOULD NEVER FIND TRADE
DEALS THAT HELPED CORPORATIONS
THAT LEAVES WORKERS AND THE DIRT.HILLARY WILL
FIGHT FOR AMERICAN WORKERS AND
WE ARE WITH HER.
[CHEERING] OK. AND JUST ONE MORE, JUST ONE
MORE. WE BELIEVE WE MUST GET BIG MONEY
OUT OF POLITICS AND ROOT OUT CORRUPTION.
[CHEERING] HILLARY WILL FIGHT TO OVERTURN
CITIZENS UNITED AND RETURN THIS GOVERNMENT TO THE PEOPLE.
[CHEERING] IF YOU BELIEVE THAT AMERICA MUST WORK FOR ALL OF US, NOT JUST THE
RICH AND POWERFUL, IF YOU
BELIEVE WE MUST REJECT THE
POLITICS OF FEAR AND DIVISION, IF YOU BELIEVE THAT WE ARE STRONGER TOGETHER, THEN LET'S
WORK OUR HEARTS OUT TO MAKE A LITERARY POCO COMING TO THE NEXT
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.
-- LET'S WORK TOGETHER TO MAKE
HILLARY CLINTON THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.
[CHEERING] THANK YOU.
