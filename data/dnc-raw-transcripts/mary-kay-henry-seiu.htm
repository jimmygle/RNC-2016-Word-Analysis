<strong>Mary Kay Henry</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> HELLO, SISTERS AND BROTHERS.
I AM MARY KAY HENRY AND I AM
PROUD TO STAND HERE ON BEHALF OF
2 MILLION MEMBERS OF SERVICE EMPLOYERS -- SERVICE EMPLOYEES
INTERNATIONAL<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> UNION. AND THE MILLIONS MORE WHO ARE FIGHTING FOR A UNION. OUR MOVEMENT WILL BE AN
UNSTOPPABLE FORCE IN THE
SELECTION BECAUSE THE STAKES
COULD NOT BE HIGHER. WE NEED A PRESIDENT WHO WANTS TO WAYS -- RAISE WAGES IN THIS COUNTRY, NOT ONE THAT SAYS WAGES ARE TOO HIGH AND THERE SHOULD
NOT BE A FEDERAL MINIMUM WAGE. THAT IS WHY WE ARE WORKING TO ELECT HILLARY CLINTON AND
CHAMPIONS UP AND DOWN THE BALLOT
WHO WILL RAISE WAGES AND HEALTH WORKERS JOINED TOGETHER IN UNIONS. HILLARY HAS SPENT TIME WITH WORKERS WHO CARE FOR CHILDREN AND OUR SENIORS. LISBETH HAS BEEN A HOMECARE PROVIDER FOR 40 YEARS. BUT SHE HAS TO RELY ON FOOD STAMPS AND MEDICAID JUST TO MAKE ENDS MEET. HILLARY CLINTON KNOWS THAT IS WRONG AND THAT IS WHY HILLARY CLINTON IS READY TO RAISE WAGES
FOR HOMECARE PROVIDERS AND CHILDCARE PROVIDERS AND ENSURE
THEY HAVE A STRONG VOICE IN QUALITY CARE. LINKED TO WINNING RACIAL JUSTICE, ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE AND IMMIGRANT JUSTICE. WE MUST ELECT HILLARY CLINTON
AND THE CHAMPIONS LIKE HER WERE
GOING TO PUT FAMILIES FIRST AND STOP THE CANDIDATE OF HATRED AND GREED. BROTHERS AND SISTERS, I BELIEVE THAT WE CAN WIN. YOU?
[CHEERING] REPEAT AFTER ME. I BELIEVE THAT WE CAN WIN!</span><span class='hidden-full-transcript-ellipses'>...</span></p><a href='#' class='hidden-full-transcript-link'><i class='icon-chevron-down'></i> <span class='link-show-full-text'>Show Full Text</span><i class='icon-chevron-up'></i> <span class='link-show-less-text'>Show Less Text</span></a>
