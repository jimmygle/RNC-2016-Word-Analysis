<strong>Charles H. Ramsey</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >>>> WHEN I WAS BUILD UP HIS POLICE COMMISSIONER, -- I WAS PHILADELPHIA'S PLEASE
COMMISSIONER, WE MOURNED 8
POLICE OFFICERS KILLED IN THE
LINE OF DUTY.<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> AFTER THE ATTACKS ON POLICE AND
POLICE -- IN DALLAS AND BATON ROUGE, THE ENTIRE NATION MOURNED
IT MORE.
-- 8 MORE.
AFTER 47 YEARS IN LAW ENFORCEMENT AND CHICAGO, WASHINGTON, DC AND PHILADELPHIA, I'VE MOURNED FAR TOO MANY OFFICERS KILLED BY GUNS. AS A NATION, WE'VE MOURNED FAR TOO MANY INNOCENT PEOPLE THAT
HAVE FALLEN VICTIM TO GUN
VIOLENCE.
I'M HERE TO SAY WE NEED MORE
THAN GREETING TO PROTECT OUR LAW
ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS.
AND TO SERVE THE MEMORY OF THOSE
HEROES WHO HAVE FOLLOWED. WE NEED COMMONSENSE MEASURES TO
REDUCE GUN VIOLENCE.
[CHEERS] POLICE NEED THESE COMMONSENSE MEASURES AND A LEADER WHO WILL
FIGHT FOR THEM.
I GREW UP IN THE ENGLEWOOD
NEIGHBORHOOD ON THE SOUTH SIDE
OF CHICAGO.
[CHEERS] THE HAZE OF GUN VIOLENCE HANGS
HEAVY THERE. MY MOTHER'S -- BROTHER'S BEST
FRIEND WAS MURDERED NOT 50 FEET
FROM OUR HOUSE. HE HAD REFUSED TO JOIN A GANG. A FEW YEARS LATER, IN THAT SAME LOCATION, A CHICAGO POLICE OFFICER WAS SHOT DEAD IN ALMOST THE SAME SPOT. HE HAD BEEN FILLING OUT THE
REPORT AND WAS MURDERED BY
THREE GANG MEMBERS. GUN VIOLENCE IS NOT UNIQUE. IT CONTINUES TO VISIT NEIGHBORHOODS ACROSS THE UNITED STATES. DURING MY YEARS IN POLICING, I
HAVE SEEN THE CRIMES, I'VE SEEN THE GRIEVING FAMILIES INCLUDING FAMILIES OF POLICE OFFICERS. I'VE SEEN THE COST OF GUN
VIOLENCE. NOW, MORE THAN EVER, WE NEED A STRONG LEADER TO STOP THE BLOODSHED.
[CHEERS] A LEADER THAT WILL PROTECT OUR OFFICERS FROM BEING OUTGUNNED BY WEAPONS OF FOUR. AND TO REBUILD THE BOND BETWEEN
POLICE AND COMMUNITIES.
[CHEERS] THAT IS WHY I'M WITH HILLARY
CLINTON.
[CHEERS] HILLARY CLINTON IS A STRONG
LEADER. TO PROTECT OUR COPS AND COMMITTEE FROM GUN VIOLENCE.
SHE HAS STOOD WITH OUR FIRST
RESPONDERS WHEN WE NEEDED HER
MOST IN THE DAYS AFTER 9/11 TO MAKE SURE THEY GOT THE BENEFIT
THEY HAD EARNED AND TODAY, SHE SUPPORTS COMPREHENSIVE BACKGROUND CHECKS AND THE
ASSAULT WEAPONS BANS.
[CHEERS] THOSE WHO AIM TO DO HARM SHOULD
NOT GET A HANDGUN, LET ALONE AN
ASSAULT RIFLE.
[CHEERS] HILLARY CLINTON IS THE STUDY LEADER TO SHEPHERD US THROUGH
THIS CRITICAL TIME. THE BONDS BETWEEN LAW ENFORCEMENT AND COMMUNITIES ARE AFRAID.
-- FRAYED. WE NEED TO CHAMPION OUR GREATEST HOPES. HILLARY WILL. SHE WILL BRING POLICE AND COMMUNITIES CLOSER TOGETHER. SHE WILL SUPPORT THOSE WHO FEEL FORGOTTEN. AREAS LIKE CHICAGO AND SOUTHEAST
DCN NORTH PHILADELPHIA. SHE WILL SUPPORT DEDICATED POLICE OFFICERS WORKING TO IMPROVE THEIR COMMUNITIES. IMPORTANT AS EVER, HILLARY CLINTON WILL BUILD BRIDGES BETWEEN COMMUNITIES AND POLICE. AND LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THAT
IS BETTER THAN BUILDING WALLS.
[CHEERS] HILLARY CLINTON IS THE RIGHT
PERSON TO BECOME THE 45TH
PRESIDENT OF UNITED STATES OF
AMERICA.
[CHEERS] SHE WILL WORK TO STRENGTHEN THE
BONDS OF TRUMP AND POLICE IN THE COMMUNITY THEY SERVE.
THAT IS WHY SHE HAS MY VOTE.
[CHEERS] MAY GOD BLESS ALL OF YOU, MAY GOD BLESS THE MEN AND WOMEN OF
LAW ENFORCEMENT AND MAY GOD
BLESS THE UNITED STATES OF
AMERICA.
[CHEERS] THANK YOU.
