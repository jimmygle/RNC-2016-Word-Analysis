<p class='short_transcript'> >> AS THE FIRST LADY OF
ARKANSAS, HILLARY CLINTON SHARED
-- THAT THE SCHOOL SHE VISITED
TO WHAT SHE CALLED THE CHELSEA TEST. IF IT WASN'T GOOD ENOUGH<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> FOR HER
DAUGHTER, IT WASN'T GOOD ENOUGH
FOR ANY CHILD IN AMERICA.
[APPLAUSE] SHE PLAYED A MAJOR ROLE IN SHAPING THE STATE EDUCATION
POLICY AND IMPROVING STANDARDS IN SCHOOLS LIKE THE ONE I WENT
TO. WHEN SHE STARTED, ARKANSAS SCHOOLS WERE RANKED SECOND WORST
IN THE NATION. BY THE TIME SHE WAS DONE, THEY WERE AMONG THE MOST IMPROVED. NOW AS A TEACHER IN THOSE SAME PUBLIC SCHOOLS, I KNOW MY STUDENTS CONTINUE TO BENEFIT FROM THE WORK HILLARY STARTED ALL THOSE YEARS AGO AND THAT IS WHY I'M WITH HER.

<p class='short_transcript'> >> HILLARY BEGAN WORKING ON
ADOPTION AND FOSTER CARE ISSUES AS A LAW STUDENT AND NEVER
STOPPED.
AS FIRST LADY, SHE ADVOCATED FOR
LANDMARK LEGISLATION<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> TO MAKE IT
EASIER FOR FAMILIES TO ADOPT
KIDS IN NEED, ESPECIALLY OLDER KIDS WHO WERE WORRIED THEY WOULD
NEVER HAVE A PERMANENT HOME. MY 17-YEAR-OLD SON WAS ONCE ONE
OF THOSE KIDS. WE ADOPTED HIM FOUR YEARS AGO
BUT IT FEELS LIKE HE'S ALWAYS
BEEN PART OF OUR FAMILY EVER.
MY THREE OTHER KIDS SWEAR HE WAS
ON FAMILY VACATIONS WE TOOK
YEARS BEFORE HE JOINED OUR
FAMILY. I'M NOT A DEMOCRAT BUT HILLARY CARES ABOUT KIDS LIKE HEATH AND
MAKING FAMILIES LIKE MINE COMPLETE.
THAT IS WHY I'M WITH HER.
