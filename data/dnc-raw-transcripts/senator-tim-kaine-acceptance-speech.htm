<strong>Tim Kaine</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> THANK YOU EVERYBODY. HELLO, PHILADELPHIA! HELLO DEMOCRATIC FAMILIES. I WANT TO START OFF BY THANKING MY BEAUTIFUL WIFE AND MY THREE WONDERFUL CHILDREN.<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> THEY ARE SITTING RIGHT UP THERE.
[CHEERS] MY SON DEPLOYED WITH HIS MARINE BATTALION JUST TWO DAYS AGO.
[CHEERS] HE DEPLOYED OVERSEAS TO PROTECT AND DEFEND THE VERY NATO ALLIES
THAT DONALD TRUMP SAYS HE NOW
WANTS TO ABANDON.
>> BOO!
>> SEMPER FI, MATT!
[CHEERS] MY PARENTS AND MY IN-LAWS ARE
HERE. OUR SIBLINGS AND SPOUSES. OUR NIECES AND NEPHEWS AND
HUNDREDS OF FRIENDS FROM VIRGINIA AND BEYOND.
[CHEERS] I LOVE SEEING YOU FRONT AND CENTER. INCLUDING MY FRIEND OF 37 YEARS,
SENIOR SENATOR MARK WARNER.
[CHEERS] MIGRATE GOVERNOR TERRY MCAULIFFE.
[CHEERS] IN MY GREAT FRIEND AND CONGRESSMAN OBVIOUS GOD.
[CHEERS]
-- BOBBY SCOTT.
[CHEERS] WE LOVE YOU ALL. TODAY, FOR MY WIFE ANNE AND
EVERY STRONG WOMAN IN THIS COUNTRY, FOR MY CHILDREN, AND
EVERY YOUNG PERSON STARTING OUT THEIR LIFE TO MAKE YOUR DREAMS REAL, FOR EVERY MAN AND WOMAN
SERVING OUR COUNTRY IN THE
MILITARY AT HOME OR ABROAD, FOR
EVERY WORKING FAMILY WORKING
HARD TO GET AHEAD AND STAY AHEAD
, FOR MY PARENTS AND IN-LAWS IN
EVERY SENIOR CITIZEN WHO HOPES
FOR A DIGNIFIED RETIREMENT WITH HEALTH CARE AND RESEARCH TO END DISEASES LIKE ALZHEIMER'S.
[CHEERS] FOR EVERY AMERICAN WHO WANTS OUR COUNTRY TO BE A BELOVED COMMUNITY WHERE PEOPLE ARE NOT DEMEANED BECAUSE OF WHO THEY ARE BUT RATHER RESPECTED FURTHER CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE NATION AND
FOR ALL OF US WHO KNOW THAT THE
BRIGHTEST FUTURE FOR OUR COUNTRY
IS THE ONE THAT WE BUILD TOGETHER AND MY FRIEND, HILLARY CLINTON, I HUMBLY ACCEPT MY
PARTY'S NOMINATION TO BE VICE
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.
[CHEERS] THANK YOU.
[CHEERS] CAN I BE HONEST WITH YOU ABOUT
SOMETHING? CAN I BE HONEST WITH YOU ABOUT SOMETHING? I NEVER EXPECTED TO BE HERE. LET ME TYPE HOW IT HAPPENED, I WAS BORN IN MINNESOTA AND
GROPING KANSAS CITY.
-- GREW UP IN KANSAS CITY.
[CHEERS] MY FOLKS WERE NOT MUCH INTO POLITICS. MY DAD RAN A UNION IRON WORKING SHOT -- SHOP.
[CHEERS] AND MY MOM WAS HIS BEST
SALESMAN. MY TWO BROTHERS AND I PITCHED INTO WORK DURING SUMMERS AND,
YOU KNOW, THAT IS HOW SMALL BUSINESSES DO IT. MY PARENTS, HERE TONIGHT AND
GOING STRONG, THEY TAUGHT ME
ABOUT HARD WORK AND KINDNESS AND
MOST ESPECIALLY, ABOUT FAITH. I WENT TO A DESOLATE NOISE HIGH
SCHOOL.
-- JESUIT BOYS HIGH SCHOOL.
[CHEERS] THAT'S A BIG LINE FOR THE JESUITS. WE HAD A MOTTO IN OUR SCHOOL,
MEANT FOR OTHERS.
-- ME FN FOR OTHERS.IT
WAS THERE THAT MY FAITH BECAME
VITAL. MY NORTH STAR FOR ORIENTED MY
LIFE. WHEN I LEFT HIGH SCHOOL, I KNEW THAT I WANTED TO BATTLE FOR
SOCIAL JUSTICE.
[CHEERS] LIKE SO MANY OF YOU.
[CHEERS] THAT IS WHY I TOOK A YEAR OFF
FROM MOSCOW TO VOLUNTEER WITH DESOLATE MISSIONARIES IN
HONDURAS. I TALK ITS HOW TO WELDERS AND
CARPENTERS. APRENDI LOS VALORES DEL PUEBLO: FE, FAMILIA, Y TRABAJO. FAITH, FAMILY AND WORK. LOS MISMOS VALORES DEL LOS QUE AQUI. SOMOS AMERICANOS TODOS. LET ME TELL YOU WHAT REALLY STRUCK ME THERE, I GOT A FIRSTHAND LOOK AT A DIFFERENT
SYSTEM.
A DICTATORSHIP. WHERE A FEW PEOPLE AT THE TOP
HAD ALL THE POWER AND EVERYBODY ELSE GOT LEFT OUT. THAT CONVINCED ME THAT WE HAVE
GOT TO ADVANCE OPPORTUNITY FOR
EVERYBODY, NO MATTER WHERE YOU
COME FROM, HOW MUCH MONEY YOU HAVE, WHAT YOU LOOK LIKE, HOW YOU WORSHIP OR WHO YOU LOVE.
[CHEERS] BACK IN 1970, IN VIRGINIA, A
REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR BELIEVED
ABSOLUTELY THE SAME THING. HE INTEGRATED VIRGINIA'S PUBLIC
SCHOOLS SO THAT BLACK-AND-WHITE KIDS COULD FINALLY LEARN TOGETHER AND THEN THE FAMILY
ENROLLED THEIR OWN KIDS, INCLUDING HIS DAUGHTER, INTO THE
INTEGRATED SCHOOLS WITH MANY
LEADERS -- YEARS LATER SHE WENT
COLLEGE ABOUT THOSE LESSONS WITH
HER. ONE DAY, IN A STUDY GROUP SHE
MET THIS GOOD BEGOTTEN WHO HAD
BEEN OFF TEACHING KIDS IN
HONDURAS. ANNE AND I HAVE NOW BEEN
MARRIED, 32 YEARS AND I'M THE LUCKIEST HUSBAND IN THE WORLD.
[CHEERS] LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING, AND
PARENTS ARE HERE TODAY 90 PLUS
AND GOING STRONG.
[CHEERS] LINWOOD HOLTON, HE IS STILL A
REPUBLICAN BUT HE IS VOTING FOR
AN AWFUL LOT OF DEMOCRATS THESE DAYS.
[CHEERS] AND HERE IS WHY, HE IS VOTING
FOR DEMOCRATS BECAUSE ANY PARTY THAT WOULD NOMINATE DONALD TRUMP
FOR PRESIDENT HAS MOVED TOO FAR AWAY FROM HIS PARTY OF LINCOLN.
[CHEERS] IN A TELL YOU, IF ANY OF YOU ARE
LOOKING FOR THAT PARTY OF LINCOLN, WE HAVE A HOME FOR YOU
RIGHT HERE IN THE DEMOCRATIC
PARTY.
[CHEERS] HIS EXAMPLE HELPED INSPIRE ME AS
A CIVIL RIGHTS LAWYER. OVER 17 YEARS I TOOK ON BANKS,
LANDLORDS, REAL ESTATE FIRMS, LOCAL GOVERNMENTS, ANYONE WHO TREATED ANYBODY UNFAIRLY. I HAD A SIX-YEAR CASE AGAINST AN INSURANCE COMPANY THAT WAS
DISCRIMINATING AGAINST MINORITY
NEIGHBORHOODS ALL ACROSS THE
UNITED STATES AND ISSUING
HOMEOWNER INSURANCE. DEMOCRATIC FRIENDS, THESE ARE
THE BATTLES THAT I HAVE THOUGHT MY ENTIRE LIFE.
-- THOUGHT MIGHT -- FOUGHT MY
ENTIRE LIFE.
[CHEERS] THAT IS THE STORY. THAT IS THE STORY OF HOW I
DECIDED TO RUN FOR OFFICE. MY CITY OF RICHMOND WAS DIVIDED AND DISCOURAGED IN THE EARLY 1990'S. WE HAD AN EPIDEMIC OF VIOLENCE
OVERWHELMING THE NEIGHBORHOOD. WE PEOPLE WERE POINTING FINGERS
AND CASTING BLAME. I CANNOT STAND IT. IRAN FOR CITY COUNCIL AND I WON THE FIRST RACE FOR THE 20 YEARS
BY A LANDSLIDE MARGIN OF 94 VOTES.
[CHEERS] AND THAT SAID EVER SENSE, IT IS
BECAUSE I STARTED AT THE LOCAL LEVEL LISTING TWO PEOPLE
LEARNING ABOUT THEIR LIVES AND
TRY TO GET RESULTS. I SEE AMERICA ARE WHO KNOWS WHAT HE'S TALKING ABOUT. LATER I BECAME MAYOR OF
RICHMOND. THEN THE 70TH GOVERNOR OF VIRGINIA.
[CHEERS] NOW, I WAS A HARD TIMES
GOVERNOR.
I HAD TO STEER MY STAGE OF THE DEEPEST RECESSION SINCE THE 1930'S.
TOUGH TIMES DON'T LAST AND HOW
PEOPLE DO.
-- TOUGH PEOPLE DO. CAN I TELL YOU THAT VIRGINIANS
ARE TOUGH PEOPLE?
[CHEERS] WE ARE TOUGH PEOPLE. AND WE ARE SMART, TOO. WE ACHIEVE NATIONAL RECOGNITION FOR OUR WORK, BEST DATE FOR BUSINESS, BEST DATE FOR A CHILD
TO BE RAISED. LOW UNEMPLOYMENT.
HIGH MEDIAN INCOME. WE SHED TEARS ALONG THE WAY. WE SHED TEARS ESPECIALLY
TOGETHER IN THE DAYS AFTER THAT
HORRIBLE MASS SHOOTING AT
VIRGINIA TECH THAT KILLED 32
PEOPLE FROM BEAUTIFUL 19 EUROS STUDENTS TO 70 PLUS-YEAR-OLD
ROMANIAN BORN HOLOCAUST SURVIVORS AND WE SHED TEARS BUT
AFTERWARDS WE ROLLED UP OUR
SLEEVES AND WE FIXED THE LOOPHOLE IN THE BACK ON RECORD
SYSTEM SO WE COULD MAKE OUR COMMONWEALTH SAFER AND WE HAVE
TO DO THAT IN THE NATION.
[CHEERS] WE INVESTED IN OUR PEOPLE EXPANDING FREE TRADE IN HIGHER EDUCATION.
WE KNOW THAT EDUCATION IS THE KEY TO ONLY WANT TO BE.
[CHEERS] NOW HAVE THE HONOR OF
REPRESENTING MY COMMONWEALTH AND
THE SENATE.
I WORK ON THE ARMED SERVICES AND
FOREIGN RELATIONS COMMITTEE TO
KEEP US SAFE AT HOME AND STRONG
IN THE WORLD.
[CHEERS] I WORK ON THE BUDGET COMMITTEE WITH OUR GREAT DEMOCRATIC LEADERS, A SPECTACULAR SENATOR
WHO USED TO BE A MANNER -- A MAYOR FROM VERMONT, BERNIE SANDERS.
[CHEERS] AND, EVERYBODY, WE ALL SHOULD FEEL THE BERN AND WE SHOULD ALL
NOT WANT TO GET BURNED BY THE
OTHER GUY.
[CHEERS] ON THAT BUDGET COMMITTEE, WE
FIGHT FOR INVESTMENTS,
EDUCATION, HEALTH CARE, RESEARCH
AND TRANSPORTATION. I ALSO SERVE ON THE COMMITTEE TO
MAKE SURE THAT SENIORS HAVE A SECURE RETIREMENT AND DON'T GET
TARGETED BY RIPOFF ARTISTS WHO
WAS SCAMMED OUT OF THEIR SAVINGS
OR OVERCHARGE THEM FOR PRESCRIPTION DRUGS.
[CHEERS] CAN I TELL YOU A FUNNY THING
ABOUT THE SENATE?
[CHEERS] THAT SOUNDS LIKE A YES. I SPEND A LOT OF TIME WITH REPUBLICAN SENATORS WHO ONCE
THEY HAVE MADE SURE THAT NOBODY IS LISTENING, WILL TELL YOU HOW FANTASTIC A SENATOR THAT HILLARY CLINTON WAS.
[CHEERS] LOOK, THIS JOURNEY THAT I'VE
TOLD YOU ABOUT HAS CONVINCED ME,
HAS CONVINCED ME OVER AND OVER AGAIN THAT GOD HAS CREATED IN
OUR COUNTRY A BEAUTIFUL AND RICH TAPESTRY, AN INCREDIBLE CULTURAL DIVERSITY THAT SUCCEEDS WHEN WE EMBRACE EVERYBODY AND BATTLE BACK, THE DARK FORCES OF
DIVISION. WE ARE ALL NEIGHBORS. WE MUST LOVE NEIGHBORS AS
OURSELVES. HILLARY CLINTON AND I SON COM PANEROS DE ALMA.
[CHEERS] WE SHARE THIS IS SIMPLY.
-- SIMPLE BELIEF. DO ALL THE GOOD YOU CAN AND
SERVE ONE ANOTHER.
[CHEERS] THAT IS WHAT I'M ABOUT. THAT IS WHAT YOU ARE ABOUT. THAT IS WHAT BERNIE SANDERS IS
ABOUT.
THAT IS WHAT JOE AND JILL BIDEN ARE ABOUT. THAT IS WHAT BARACK AND MICHELLE OBAMA ARE ABOUT AND THAT IS WHAT
HILLARY CLINTON IS ABOUT.
[CHEERS] SI SE PUEDE!
[CHEERS] YES WE CAN. YES WE CAN.
[CHEERS] LAST WEEK, LAST WEEK IN
CLEVELAND WE HEARD A LOT ABOUT TRUMP. LET'S TALK ABOUT TRUST. I WANT TO TELL YOU WHY I TRUST HILLARY CLINTON.
[CHEERS] FIRST, SHE'S CONSISTENT.
SHE HAS BATTLED TO PUT KIDS AND FAMILIES FIRST SINCE SHE WAS A
TEENAGER. IN GOOD TIMES AND BAD.
IN VICTORY AND DEFEAT. IN AND OUT OF OFFICE THROUGH HELL OR HIGH WATER FIGHTING FOR UNDERPRIVILEGED KIDS WORKING AT THE CHILDREN'S DEFENSE FUND. BITING TO GET HEALTH INSURANCE
FOR 8 MILLION LOW INCOME
CHILDREN. FIGHTING FOR THE WELL-BEING OF
WOMEN AND CHILDREN AROUND THE
WORLD.
[CHEERS] CAN OFFER YOU A LITTLE TIP? WHEN YOU WANT TO KNOW SOMETHING
ABOUT THE CHARACTER OF SOMEBODY
IN PUBLIC LIFE, LOOK TO SEE IF
THEY HAVE A PASSION THAT BEGAN
LONG BEFORE THEY WERE IN OFFICE. AND THAT THEY HAVE CONSISTENTLY
HELD IT SINCE THEIR CAREER.
[CHEERS] DO THEY HAVE A PASSION, DID IT START BEFORE THEY WERE IN
OFFICE, HAVE A HELP ONTO IT
CONSISTENTLY? HILLARY HAS A PASSION FOR KIDS AND FAMILIES.
[CHEERS] DONALD TRUMP HAS A PASSION, IT IS HIMSELF.
[CHEERS] WITH HILLARY, IT IS NOT JUST WORDS AND A COMPETENCE. SHE DELIVERS AS A SENATOR. SHE BATTLED AFTER 9/11. HE WENT TO THE TOWERS, WENT TO
THE PENTAGON AND SAVE THE
VICTIMS OF THE TERRORIST
ATTACKS. AS SECRETARY OF STATE, SHE IMPLEMENTED TOUGH SANCTIONS AGAINST IRAN TO PAY THE WAY FOR A DIPLOMATIC RATE THROUGH TO CURTAIL -- BREAKTHROUGH TO
CURTAIL A NUCLEAR WEAPONS
PROGRAM. SHE WAS NOT AFRAID, SHE WAS NOT
AFRAID. SHE WAS NOT AFRAID TO STAND UP TO DICTATORS. THEY DECIDED TO GO TO THE END OF THE EARTH TO WIPE OUT OSAMA BIN LADEN IS.
-- OSAMA BIN LADEN.
[CHEERS] DID Y'ALL REMEMBER THE LITTLE
GIRL WE HEARD FROM ON MONDAY NIGHT WAS WORRIED THAT HER PARENTS WOULD BE DEPORTED? CARLA SAID SHE TRUSTS HILLARY TO
KEEP THEM TOGETHER.
[CHEERS] IN THE MEMBER -- DO YOU REMEMBER
THE MOTHERS OF THE MOVEMENT LAST
NIGHT?
[CHEERS] THEY SAID THEY TRUST HILLARY TO
KEEP OTHER MOTHERS'  SONS AND
DAUGHTERS SAFE. AND ON A PERSONAL LEVEL, AS HE IS SERVING OUR NATION ABROAD, I TRUST HILLARY CLINTON WITH OUR SONS LIFE.
[CHEERS] YOU KNOW WHO I DON'T TRUST? I WONDER. DONALD TRUMP. TRUMP IS A GUY WHO PROMISES A LOT BUT, YOU MAY HAVE NOTICED,
HE HAS A WAY OF SAYING THE SAME TWO WORDS EVERY TIME HE MAKES HIS BIGGEST, HE JUST PROMISES. BELIEVE ME. IT IS GOING TO BE GREAT, BELIEVE
ME. WE ARE TO BUILD A WALL AND MAKE MEXICO PAY FOR, BELIEVE ME.
[LAUGHTER] WE ARE GOING TO DESTROY ISSA SO
FAST, BELIEVE ME.
[LAUGHTER] THERE IS NOTHING SUSPICIOUS AND
MY TAX RETURNS, BELIEVE ME.
[LAUGHTER]
[CHEERS] BY THE WAY, DOES ANYBODY IN THIS MASSIVE AUDITORIUM BELIEVE THAT DONALD TRUMP'S BEEN PAYING HIS
FAIR SHARE OF TAXES?
>> NOOO!
>> DOES ANYBODY HERE BELIEVE THAT DONALD TRUMP OUGHT TO
RELEASE HIS TAX RETURNS IS LIKE
EVERY OTHER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE IN MODERN HISTORY?
[CHEERS] OF COURSE HE SHOULD. DONALD, WHAT ARE YOU HIDING? AND YET, DONALD STILL SAYS BELIEVE ME.
BELIEVE ME.
[LAUGHTER] BELIEVE ME. BELIEVE ME. HERE'S THE THING, MOST PEOPLE
WHEN THEY RUN FOR PRESIDENT,
THEY DON'T JUST SAY BELIEVE ME, THEY RESPECT YOU ENOUGH TO TELL YOU HOW THEY WILL GET THINGS DONE.
[CHEERS] THAT IS WHAT MOST PEOPLE WHO RUN FOR PRESIDENT TO.
-- DO. IN FACT, HE CAN GO ON HILLARY CLINTON.COM RIGHT NOW AND FIND OUT EXACTLY HOW SHE WILL MAKE
THE BIGGEST INVESTMENT IN NEW
JOBS IN A GENERATION. HOW SHE WILL DEFEND AND BUILD ON
WALL STREET REFORMS, HOW SHE
WILL REFORM OUR IMMIGRATION
SYSTEM TO CREATE A PATH TO CITIZENSHIP HOW SHE WILL MAKE IT
POSSIBLE TO GRADUATE FROM COLLEGE DEBT-FREE. YOU WILL SEE HOW SHE WILL
PROTECT ROE BE WEIGHED, OR TO EQUAL PAY FOR WOMEN AND MAKE
PAID FAMILY A REALITY.
[CHEERS]
-- FAMILY LEAVE A REALITY.
[CHEERS] ALL IT TAKES IS ONE CLICK AND WE CAN SEE HOW SHE WILL DO IT, HOW SHE WILL PAY WITH -- FOR IT AND
HOW WE WILL BENEFIT BY IT. NOT DONALD TRUMP. NOT DONALD TRUMP. HE NEVER TELLS YOU HOW HE IS GOING TO DO ANY OF THE THINGS HE SAYS HE WILL DO.
HE JUST SAYS, BELIEVE ME.
[LAUGHTER] SO HERE'S THE QUESTION, HERE'S THE QUESTION, DO YOU REALLY
BELIEVE HIM?
>> NO!
>> DONALD TRUMP'S WHOLE CAREER
SAYS HE BETTER NOT. SMALL CONTRACTORS, COMPANIES
JUST LIKE MY DAD'S BELIEVE HIM,
LEAVE HIM CUT WHEN HE SAID -- BELIEVED HIM WHEN THEY SAID HE
WOULD PAY THE CASINO. THEY DO THE WORK, HUNG THE DRYWALL, FOR THE CONCRETE, BUT A
YEAR AFTER OPENING, DONALD TRUMP
UP BANKRUPTCY, HE WALKED AWAY
WITH MILLIONS AND THEY GOT
PENNIES ON THE DOLLAR. SOME OF THEM WENT OUT OF
BUSINESS. ALL BECAUSE THEY BELIEVED DONALD TRUMP.
>> BOO!
>> RETIREES AND FAMILIES IN FLORIDA, THEY BELIEVED DONALD TRUMP WHEN HE SAID HE WOULD
BUILD UP SOME CONDOS. THOUSANDS OF THEM. THEY PAID THEIR DEPOSITS BUT THE CONDOS, THEY WERE NEVER BUILT. HE JUST POCKETED THEIR MONEY AND
WALKED AWAY. THEY LOST TENS OF THOUSANDS OF
DOLLARS ALL BECAUSE THEY BELIEVED DONALD TRUMP. CHARITY AFTER CHARITY BELIEVED
DONALD TRUMP WHEN HE SAID THEY
WOULD CONTRIBUTE TO THAT. THOUSANDS OF TRUMP UNIVERSITY STUDENTS LEAVE -- BELIEVED DONALD TRUMP WHEN HE SAID HE
WOULD HELP THEM SUCCEED. THEY GOT STIFFED.
>> BOO!
>> HE SAYS BELIEVE ME, HIS CREDITORS, HIS CONTRACTORS, HIS
LAID OFF EMPLOYEES, AND HIS RIPPED OFF STUDENTS DID JUST
THAT AND THEY ALL GOT HURT. FOLKS, YOU CANNOT BELIEVE ONE WORD THAT COMES OUT OF DONALD TRUMP'S MOUTH [CHEERS]
.
[CHEERS] NOT ONE WORD. NOT ONE WORD.
[CHEERS] NOT ONE WORD.
>> NOT ONE WORD. NOT ONE WORD.
>> I WILL TELL YOU. TO ME, IT SEEMS LIKE OUR NATION PROMISING SELF-PROMOTING ONE-MAN
WRECKING CREW.
[CHEERS] BUT DON'T TAKE IT FROM ME, DON'T
TAKE IT FROM ME. TAKE IT FROM FORMER FIRST LADY
BARBARA BUSH. BARBARA BUSH SAYS SHE DOES NOT
KNOW HOW ANY WOMAN COULD VOTE
FOR HIM AFTER HIS OFFENSIVE COMMENTS TO WOMEN.
[CHEERS] ANY WOMAN. OR JOHN MCCAIN'S CHIEF ECONOMIC
ADVISER DURING THE 2008 RACE WHO ESTIMATES THAT DONALD TRUMP'S PROMISES WOULD COST AMERICA TO LOSE 3.5 MILLION JOBS. OR THE INDEPENDENT ANALYSTS WHO
FOUND THAT DONALD TRUMP TAX PLAN
GIVEN TO THE WEALTHY AND BIGGEST CORPORATIONS WOULD RACK UP $30
TRILLION IN DEBT.
OR HOW ABOUT THIS? JOHN KASICH, THE REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR OF WHO HAD THE HONOR
OF HOSTING THE REPUBLICAN
CONVENTION IN CLEVELAND, BUT
WOULD NOT ATTEND BECAUSE HE
THINKS DONALD TRUMP IS SUCH A MORAL DISASTER.
[CHEERS] OR TAKE IT FROM THE GUY WHO COWROTE DONALD TRUMP'S AUTOBIOGRAPHY, HERE IS WHAT HE
SAID ABOUT DONALD TRUMP. LYING IS SECOND NATURE TO HIM. SO DO YOU BELIEVE HIM?
>> NO!
>> HOW ABOUT THE SIDE, DO YOU
BELIEVE HIM?
>> NO!!
>> IS THERE ANYONE IN THIS OLD AND WHO BELIEVES THEM?!  -- HIM?
>> NO!
>> THE NEXT PRESIDENT WILL FACE
MANY CHALLENGES, WE BETTER ELECT
A CANDIDATE WHO HAS PROVEN SHE
CAN BE TRUSTED WITH THE JOB.
[CHEERS] THE CANDIDATE WHO HAS PROVEN
THAT SHE IS READY FOR THE JOB AND WHEN I SAY READY, I USE
READY FOR A SPECIFIC REASON. WHEN I LIVED IN HONDURAS, I
LEARNED SOMETHING.
THE BEST COMPLEMENT YOU COULD
PAY TO SOMEBODY WAS TO SAY THAT THEY WERE LISTO. READY. NOT INTELIGENTE, AMABLE, RICO. BUT LISTO BECAUSE IN SPANISH IT MEANS PREPARED, UP FOR
ANYTHING, NEVER BACKING DOWN. FRIENDS, HILLARY CLINTON IS
LISTA!
[CHEERS] SHE IS READY.
[CHEERS] SHE'S READY BECAUSE OF HER
FAITH, BECAUSE OF HER HEART, SHE
IS READY BECAUSE OF HER EXPERIENCE AND SHE IS READY
BECAUSE SHE KNOWS THAT IN
AMERICA, WE ARE STRONGER WHEN WE
ARE TOGETHER.
[CHEERS] MY FELLOW DEMOCRATS, THIS WEEK WE START THE NEXT CHAPTER IN OUR GREAT AND PROUD STORY. THOMAS DISCLAIMED ALL MEN WERE EQUAL AND ABIGAIL REMEMBER THE
WOMEN. WOODROW BROKERED THE PEACE AND
ELEANOR BROKE DOWN THE BARRIER. JACK TOLD US WHAT TO ASK AND LYNDON ANSWER THE CALL.
MARTIN HAD A DREAM AND DOLORES SAID SI SE PUEDE. BILL BUILT A BRIDGE INTO THE 21ST CENTURY AND BRCA BUZZ HOPE AND NOW -- BARACK GAVE US HOPE AND HILLARY IS READY TO FIGHT
AND WIN. GOD WAS ALL THE AND ONTO VICTORY.
[CHEERS] THANK YOU, PHILADELPHIA!
