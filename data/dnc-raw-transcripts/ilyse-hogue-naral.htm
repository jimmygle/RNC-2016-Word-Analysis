<p class='short_transcript'> >> I AM A FOURTH GENERATION TEXAN. TEXAS WOMEN ARE TOUGH. WE APPROACH CHALLENGES WITH
CLEAR EYES AND FULL HEARTS. TO SUCCEED IN LIFE, ALL WE NEED
ARE<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> THE TOOLS, THE TRUST, AND THE CHANCE TO CHART OUR OWN
PATH. I WAS FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO HAVE THESE THINGS WHEN I FOUND OUT I
WAS PREGNANT YEARS AGO.
I WANTED A FAMILY, BUT IT WAS
THE WRONG TIME. I MADE THE DECISION THAT WAS
BEST FOR ME. TO HAVE AN ABORTION AND GET PASSIONATE CARE IN A CLINIC IN MY OWN COMMUNITY. NOW YEARS LATER MY HUSBAND AND I ARE PARENTS TO TWO INCREDIBLE CHILDREN. MY STORY IS NOT UNIQUE. ABOUT ONE IN THREE AMERICAN
WOMEN HAVE ABORTIONS BY THE AGE OF 45 AND THE MAJORITY ARE
MOTHERS JUST TRYING TO TAKE CARE
OF THE FAMILIES THEY ALREADY
HAVE. YOU SEE, IT'S NOT AS SIMPLE AS THAT GIRLS GET ABORTIONS AND GO GIRLS HAVE FAMILIES.
WE ARE THE SAME WOMEN AT
DIFFERENT TIMES IN OUR LIVES.
-- IT'S NOT AS SIMPLE AS BAD GIRLS GET ABORTIONS AND GOOD GIRLS HAVE FAMILIES.
IF WE WANT FAMILIES TO SUCCEED,
WE START BY EMPOWERING WOMEN.
GIVE US ACCURATE INFORMATION AND
ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE. KEEP POLITICIANS OUT OF OUR BUSINESS WHEN WE ARE NOT READY TO PARENT, AND SUPPORT US WHEN
WE ARE. THAT IS WHAT GIVES OUR FAMILIES
THE BEST CHANCE TO GET AHEAD AND STAY AHEAD. AND THAT IS WHAT HILLARY CLINTON
HAS SPENT DECADES FIGHTING FOR. DONALD TRUMP IS DIFFERENT. HE SAID WOMEN WHO HAVE ABORTIONS
LIKE ME SHOULD BE PUNISHED.
HE CALLS WOMEN PIGS AND SAYS
BREAST-FEEDING IS DISGUSTING. SOME PEOPLE THINK HE DOESN'T
REALLY MEAN ANY OF THAT. BUT LOOK AT WHO HE PICKS FOR VP. MIKE PENCE HAS LED THE CHARGE TO DEFUND PLANNED PARENTHOOD, PUSH
TO LET HOSPITALS TURN A WOMAN
AWAY IF SHE NEEDS AN ABORTION TO SAVE HER LIFE, AND SIGNED A BILL
WITH SOME OF THE MOST OUTRAGEOUS
ABORTION RESTRICTIONS IN THE
COUNTRY. HE EVEN SAID HE CAN'T WAIT TO SEND ROVERS IS WAIT INTO THE -- SEND ROE V. WADE INTO THE ASH
HEAP OF HISTORY. DONALD TRUMP AND MIKE PENCE HAVE FORMED THE "MAKE MISOGYNY GREAT AGAIN" TICKET. AND THE PEOPLE WHO SO LOUDLY OPPOSED ABORTION RIGHTS, LET ME
LET YOU INTO THEIR DIRTY LITTLE
SECRET. THEY ARE NOT ONLY AGAINST ABORTION. MANY OF THESE PEOPLE ARE ALSO
FIGHTING TO RESTRICT ACCESS TO CONTRACEPTION AND BLOCK COMMONSENSE POLICIES TO SUPPORT WORKING MOMS. IT'S NOT ABORTION THAT BOTHERS THEM, IT'S EMPOWERING WOMEN TO
LIVE OUR OWN LIVES. THAT IS RIGHT. AND WHEN WE HAVE POWER OVER OUR DESTINY, WE NOT ONLY STRENGTHEN
OUR FAMILIES, WE HONBOR ARE MOST CHERISHED TRADITIONS OF LIBERTY
AND EQUALITY. THESE AREN'T JUST WOMEN'S ISSUES, THESE ARE THE VERY
FOUNDATION OF OUR FREEDOM. WE NEED A PRESIDENT WHO HAS THE
EXPERIENCE, THE WISDOM, AND THE
GREAT TO STAND UP AGAINST THE
BULLIES. WE NEED A PRESIDENT WHO KNOWS
THAT WOMEN'S RIGHTS ARE HUMAN
RIGHTS. WE NEED A PRESIDENT WHO WILL
KEEP EXPANDING THE FRONTIERS OF
FREEDOM FOR ALL AMERICANS. WE DID HILLARY CLINTON.
-- WE NEED HILLARY CLINTON.</span><span class='hidden-full-transcript-ellipses'>...</span></p><a href='#' class='hidden-full-transcript-link'><i class='icon-chevron-down'></i> <span class='link-show-full-text'>Show Full Text</span><i class='icon-chevron-up'></i> <span class='link-show-less-text'>Show Less Text</span></a>
