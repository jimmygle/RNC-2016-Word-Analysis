<p class='short_transcript'> >> UNTIL THE 1970'S, YOUNG
PEOPLE WHO GOT IN TROUBLE IN
SOUTH CAROLINA WERE HOUSED IN
THE SAME PRISON CELLS AS ADULTS.
IT WAS A DANGEROUS POLICY THAT
PUT<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> KIDS AT SERIOUS RISK FOR
ABUSE. THE CHILDREN'S DEFENSE FUND SENT
HILLARY TO THESE PRISONS TO
INVESTIGATE.
AS A RESULT, THE STATE ENDED THIS PRACTICE. FROM THE MOMENT A CHILD TOUCHES THE SYSTEM, IT'S IMPORTANT TO
NOT LET THEM FALL BEHIND. THAT IS WHY I BECAME A JUVENILE JUSTICE LAWYER.
YOU DON'T OFTEN MAKE HEADLINES
FIGHTING FOR KIDS BUT HER WHOLE
CAREER, HILLARY HAS BEEN QUIETLY LEADING THAT SITE ANYWAY.
THAT IS WHY I'M WITH HER.

<p class='short_transcript'> >> AS THE FIRST LADY OF
ARKANSAS, HILLARY CLINTON SHARED
-- THAT THE SCHOOL SHE VISITED
TO WHAT SHE CALLED THE CHELSEA TEST. IF IT WASN'T GOOD ENOUGH<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> FOR HER
DAUGHTER, IT WASN'T GOOD ENOUGH
FOR ANY CHILD IN AMERICA.
[APPLAUSE] SHE PLAYED A MAJOR ROLE IN SHAPING THE STATE EDUCATION
POLICY AND IMPROVING STANDARDS IN SCHOOLS LIKE THE ONE I WENT
TO. WHEN SHE STARTED, ARKANSAS SCHOOLS WERE RANKED SECOND WORST
IN THE NATION. BY THE TIME SHE WAS DONE, THEY WERE AMONG THE MOST IMPROVED. NOW AS A TEACHER IN THOSE SAME PUBLIC SCHOOLS, I KNOW MY STUDENTS CONTINUE TO BENEFIT FROM THE WORK HILLARY STARTED ALL THOSE YEARS AGO AND THAT IS WHY I'M WITH HER.
