>> I SHOULD NOT BE HERE TONIGHT. I DON'T WANT TO BE HERE TONIGHT. I SHOULD<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> BE HOME, LIKE SO MANY
AMERICANS WATCHING ON TV WITH MY MOTHER AS WE NOMINATE THE FIRST
WOMAN TO BE PRESIDENT OF THE
UNITED STATES.
[CHEERS] BUT, MY MOM WAS MURDERED. SO I'M HERE. I'M HERE FOR THE MOTHERS AND DAUGHTERS WHO ARE PLANNING WEDDINGS SO THAT YOU GET TO
WATCH YOUR DAUGHTERS WALKED DOWN THE AISLE. I'M HERE FOR THOSE LIVES CUT SHORT IN A SCHOOL, AND A MOVIE THEATER, AND A CHURCH, AT WORK,
IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OR HOMES,
BECAUSE THE VOICES SHOULD NEVER BE SILENT.
[CHEERS] I'M HERE ALONE WITHOUT MY
MOTHER. TOO MANY POLITICIANS POWER BEHIND THE GUN LOBBY INSTEAD OF STANDING WITH AMERICANS.
[CHEERS] WE DON'T NEED ANOTHER CHARLESTON OR SAN BERNARDINO OR DALLAS OR COUNTLESS OTHER ACTS OF EVERYDAY
GUN VIOLENCE THAT DON'T MAKE THE GUN VIOLENCE HEADLINES.
WE DON'T NEED OUR TEACHERS AND
KIDS WAS GOING TO WORK IN FEAR.
WHAT WE NEED IS ANOTHER MOTHER
WHO IS WILLING TO DO WHAT IS RIGHT.
[CHEERS] WHOSE BRAVERY CAN LIVE UP IN
EQUAL MEASURE TO MY MOMS. WHAT WE NEED IS TO ELECT HILLARY
CLINTON AT THE 45TH PRESIDENT OF
THE UNITED STATES AMATEUR SO
THAT NO OTHER DAUGHTER HAS TO SAY I WOULD GIVE EVERY SINGLE DAY THAT I HAVE LEFT FOR JUST
ONE MORE DAY WITH MY MOM.
