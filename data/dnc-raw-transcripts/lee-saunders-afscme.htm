<strong>Lee A. Saunders</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> GOOD EVENING. I AM PROUD TO BE HERE REPRESENTING THE 1.6 MILLION
PUBLIC SERVICE WORKERS. WE KEEP OUR COMMITTEE SAFE AND
STRONG -- OUR COMMUNITY SAFE<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> AND STRONG, PLOWING ROADS AND
ANSWERING 911 CALLS. EVERY DAY IN EVERY WAY, WE FAMILIES -- WE NEVER QUIT PUTTING FAMILIES FIRST. HILLARY CLINTON NEVER QUITS
EITHER. SHE UNDERSTANDS THAT COLLECTIVE BARGAINING RIGHTS STRENGTHEN ALL OF US.
WE NEED A PRESIDENT WHO GETS THAT AND UNDERSTAND THAT BUSTING UNIONS AND CUTTING SERVICES
MEANS FAMILIES SUFFER. LOOK AT FLINT, MICHIGAN, IS POLICIES LED DIRECTLY TO PRESENT DRINKING WATER -- WHERE POISONOUS POLICIES LED DIRECTLY TO PRESOISONED DRINKING WATER.
I WAS IN LAS VEGAS AT THE TRUMP HOTEL LAST WEEK AND THEY VOTED TO FORM A UNION. BUT DONALD TRUMP WILL NOT MEET WITH THEM. IT IS NO SURPRISE, I GUESS.
HOW CAN YOU BE A STRONG WORKER
WHEN YOU ARE FAMOUS FOR THE CATCHPHRASE, YOU ARE FIRED? THIS IS NOT REALITY TELEVISION. THIS IS REALITY. WE NEED A SERIOUS MINDED LEADER WHO PUTS FAMILIES FIRST.
NOT A THIN-SKINNED BULLY WHO PUTS HIMSELF FIRST. UNSTOPPABLE CHAMPION VERSUS AN UNSTABLE CHARLATAN. I KNOW WHAT SIDE I AM ON.
I AM WITH HER. ELECT HILLARY CLINTON THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.
