<strong>Barbara A. Mikulski</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> SEN. MIKULSKI: FELLOW DEMOCRATS AND A SPECIAL HELLO TO THE STATE OF MARYLAND! OUR NATION WAS BORN HERE IN PHILADELPHIA 240 YEARS AGO. OUR FOUNDING FATHERS<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> GAVE US A GREAT START, BUT IT WAS THE
FOUNDING MOTHERS THAT SAID "DO
NOT FORGET THE LADIES, FOR WE
WILL FOMENT OUR OWN REVOLUTION."
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]THEY STARTED THE JOB, BUT WE ARE GOING TO KEEP IT GOING. NO YES, WE DO BREAK BARRIERS. I BROKEN BARRIER WHEN I BECAME THE FIRST DEMOCRATIC WOMAN ELECTED IN THE SENATE IN HER OWN RIGHT.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] IN THE FIRST TO SHARE THE POWERFUL APPROPRIATIONS WITH IT. SO IT IS WITH A FULL HEART THAT
I AM HERE TODAY AS WE NOMINATE HILLARY CLINTON TO BE THE FIRST WOMAN PRESIDENT.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] MANY OF YOU HAVE BROKEN
BARRIERS. YOU WERE THE FIRST TO GO TO COLLEGE, THE FIRST TO START A BUSINESS, MAYBE THE FIRST TO BE
A CITIZEN. BUT WHEN YOU BROKE A BARRIER,
YOU DID NOT DO IT FOR YOURSELF,
YOU DID IT FOR OTHERS WHO WOULD
NOT HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY. THAT IS WHAT HILLARY WANTS TO
DO. SHE WANTS TO BREAK THE BARRIER TO OPPORTUNITY SO YOU WON'T HAVE
BARRIER'S. YOU CAN COUNT ON HER. SHE WILL WORK FOR YOU. HILLARY WANTS TO GET RESULTS. SHE WILL FIGHT FOR YOUR
DAY-TO-DAY NEEDS. AND THE LONG-RANGE NEEDS OF THE COUNTRY. SHE WILL FIGHT FOR THE MACRO ISSUES AND THE MACARONI AND
CHEESE ISSUES. SO YOU WILL HAVE NATIONAL
SECURITY AND ECONOMIC SECURITY.
SO YOU WILL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY
FOR GOOD JOBS AND A GOOD
NEIGHBORHOOD WITH A GOOD SCHOOL, AND YOUR KIDS WILL HAVE A REALLY
GOOD FUTURE. SO YOU WILL HAVE EQUAL PAY FOR EQUAL WORK, MINIMUM WAGES--
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] FOR HEALTH CARE WHEN YOU NEED IT. YES, IT'S ABOUT NEW JOBS, AND
THE SOLAR ENERGY. SHE WANTS THAT JOB TO LIGHT UP
YOUR HOME, LIGHT UP YOUR
COMMUNITY, LIGHT UP YOUR LIFE. SHE WANTS THAT LITTLE LIFE IN YOU TO SHINE. THE HILLARY I WORK WITH IS DUTY DRIVEN AND UNFLINCHING.
SHE IS A LEADER. SO ON BEHALF OF ALL THE WOMEN
WHO HAVE BROKEN DOWN BARRIERS FOR OTHERS, AND WITH EYES TOWARD
THE BARRIERS AHEAD, I PROBABLY PRAISE HILLARY CLINTON THE NOMINATE FOR PRESIDENT.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
--I PROUDLY PRAISE HILLARY
CLINTON AT THE NOMINEE FOR
PRESIDENT.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] PLEASE WELCOME REPRESENTATIVE
JOHN LEWIS FROM GEORGIA.
