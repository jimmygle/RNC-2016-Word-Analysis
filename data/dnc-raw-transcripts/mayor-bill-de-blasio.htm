<strong>Bill de Blasio Jr.</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> MAYOR DE BLASIO: THANK YOU.
THANK YOU, DEMOCRATS! AS A NEW YORKER, I AM QUITE FAMILIAR WITH BOTH PRESIDENTIAL NOMINEES. BUT DESPITE SHARING A HOME STATE,<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> THESE TWO PEOPLE ARE WORLDS APART. I WAS HONORED TO MANAGE HILLARY CLINTON'S FIRST CAMPAIGN FOR THE U.S. SENATE AND HERE'S THE HILLARY I KNOW.
WHEN SHE GRADUATED FROM LAW SCHOOL, SHE COULD HAVE BEGUN A
LUCRATIVE CAREER AS A
PRESTIGIOUS LAW FIRM OF HER
CHOICE. INSTEAD, HER HEART LED HER TO TAKE A NOBLE JOB AT MODEST PAY AT THE CHILDREN'S DEFENSE FUND ADVOCATING FOR POOR FAMILIES AND CHILDREN WHO NEEDED A CHAMPION.
THAT IS WHO SHE IS.
WHAT DID DONALD TRUMP DO?
HE WAS BORN RICH. HE MADE A CAREER OUT OF RIPPING
PEOPLE OFF, RACKING UP BILLIONS IN DEBT AND BANKRUPTING HIS COMPANIES.
INSTEAD OF PUBLIC SERVICE OR
PHILANTHROPY, HE BECAME ONE OF
THE LEAST GENEROUS BILLIONAIRES
OUR COUNTRY HAS EVER SEEN.
WHEN HILLARY CLINTON WAS FIRST
LADY OF THE UNITED STATES, SHE MADE IT HER PERSONAL MISSION TO
TAKE ON THE INSURANCE GIANTS TO
GET HEALTHCARE FOR EVERY AMERICAN. NOW, DESPITE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS
SPENT ATTACKING HER, SHE NEVER
GAVE UP AND SHE HELPED DELIVER
THE CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM AGAINST ALL THE ODDS.
[APPLAUSE] MAYOR DE BLASIO: WHO DID DONALD TAKE ON?
THE SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS HE
CONTRACTED WITH ON HIS REAL ESTATE PROJECTS. TOO MANY TIMES, DONALD SIMPLY STIFFED THEM. NOW, WE KNOW TRUMP IS THE GREAT PRETENDER, BUT HOW CAN HE
PRETEND TO BE FOR AMERICAN
WORKERS WHEN HE DIDN'T EVEN PAY
HIS OWN WORKERS WHAT HE OWED THEM.
WHEN HILLARY CLINTON WAS IN THE
SENATE, SHE HELPED SECURE $20 BILLION FOR OUR RECOVERY AFTER 9/11, PROTECTING OUR HERO FIRST RESPONDERS WHO SACRIFICED SO MUCH.
WHO DID DONALD PROTECT? CERTAINLY NOT THE STUDENTS AT TRUMP UNIVERSITY, A PLACE HIS
OWN EMPLOYEES CALLED A SCAM,
WHERE VULNERABLE AMERICANS WERE
PUSHED TO SPEND MORE AND MORE
MONEY ON WORTHLESS CLASSES. THE ONLY PERSON DONALD TOOK CARE OF WAS HIMSELF.
AS SECRETARY OF STATE, HILLARY
FOUGHT FOR THE DIGNITY OF WOMEN AND GIRLS, PASSIONATELY FIGHTING THE SCOURGE OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING AND THE HORROR OF CHILD MARRIAGE
IN SAUDI ARABIA.
WHAT DID DONALD DO? HE'S CALLED WOMEN DOGS AND FAT
PIGS AND BLAMED MILITARY SEXUAL
ASSAULT ON THE PRESENCE OF WOMEN
IN OUR ARMED FORCES.
[BOOING] MAYOR DE BLASIO: HE'S DEGRADED WOMEN TO MAKE HIMSELF FEEL BIG,
WHILE SHOWING US THE TRULY
LITTLE MAN THAT HE IS.
WHEN -- WHEN HILLARY CLINTON
RAISES HER RIGHT HAND ON INAUGURATION DAY, SHE WILL BE ARMED WITH THE MOST PROGRESSIVE AGENDA IN MODERN TIMES, ONE THAT REWARDS WORK INSTEAD OF WEALTH, ONE THAT FLIPS THE SCRIPT ON ECONOMIC POLICIES OF AND BY AND FOR THE 1%.
FROM PAID SICK LEAVE AND PAID
FAMILY LEAVE TO UNIVERSAL PRE-K AND DEBT-FREE COLLEGE, FROM ENDING TAX LOOPHOLES FOR WALL
STREET AND BILLIONAIRE INVESTORS, TO ADDRESSING THE
NEEDS OF AMERICAN CITIES ON HOUSING, INFRASTRUCTURE, IMMIGRATION. HILLARY CLINTON WILL TACKLE
INEQUALITY AND BE A FORCE FOR REAL, PROGRESSIVE CHANGE IN THIS NATION.
NOW, HOW DOES DONALD SEE THE
ECONOMIC REALITIES FACING THE AMERICAN PEOPLE?
ACTUALLY, HE ROOTS FOR ECONOMIC TURMOIL FOR HIS OWN PERSONAL GAIN.
YOU WANT A REAL-LIFE EXAMPLE? WHEN ASKED IN 2006 ABOUT A POSSIBLE REAL ESTATE CRASH, HE SAID, QUOTE, I SORT OF HOPE THAT HAPPENS BECAUSE THEN PEOPLE LIKE
ME WILL GO IN AND BUY.
THAT IS THE VERY DEFINITION OF THE PREDATOR CLASS.
AND NOW, HE WANTS TO GO FURTHER AND REPEAL THE NEW RULES WE PUT IN PLACE TO MAKE WALL STREET MORE ACCOUNTABLE. THROUGHOUT HER CAREER, AS WE
HEARD SO CLEARLY LAST NIGHT,
HILLARY CLINTON HAS TAKEN ON THE TOUGH BATTLES FOR ONE REASON, BECAUSE STANDING UP FOR THOSE WITHOUT MUCH MONEY AND WITHOUT MUCH POWER HAS BEEN HER LIFE'S CALLING. HILLARY CLINTON, SHE'S SMART, SHE'S STEADY, SHE'S RIGHT AND SHE'S READY!
[APPLAUSE] MAYOR DE BLASIO: DONALD TRUMP, HE'S RECKLESS, HE'S RISKY, HE'S WRONG AND HE'S SCARY! IF YOU CARE ABOUT FIGHTING INCOME INEQUALITY, ABOUT LIFTING
UP FAMILIES AND CHILDREN, ABOUT
BUILDING UP AMERICA'S GREAT
CITIES, THEN LET'S COME TOGETHER, FIGHT TOGETHER, AND LET'S ELECT HILLARY CLINTON, THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THESE UNITED
STATES! THANK YOU!
