<strong>Unidentified Speaker</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> ONE OF MY>> FIRST MEMORIES AS
STANDING OUTSIDE MY POLLING
PLACE WITH MY DAD. THE HANDOUT CAMPAIGN LITERATURE IN SUPPORT OF ART CHOSEN CANDIDATE, OUR<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> CHOSEN REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE. WHEN IT COMES TO CAMPAIGNING, I
HAVE DONE IT ALL. PHONE BANKS, NOT ON SOME OF THE
DOORS. I BET A LOT OF YOU DID THE SAME
THING. ONE DIFFERENCE, I CAMPAIGN EXCLUSIVELY FOR THE GOP UNTIL
THIS ELECTION.
[CHEERS] I VOTED REPUBLICAN MY ENTIRE
LIFE. I BELIEVE IN THE BEDROCK VALUES OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY. LIBERTY, EQUALITY, AND THE
BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS THAT CANNOT BE TAKEN AWAY. HIS ADVICE TO BE PROUD OF. AND BECAUSE -- THESE ARE VALUES
TO BE PROUD OF.
BECAUSE THE REVOKING VALUES HAVE BEEN ABANDONED -- REPUBLICAN DOLLARS HAVE BEEN ABANDONED US
ARE, THIS REPUBLICAN IS VOTING
FOR HILLARY.
[CHEERS] IT DOES NOT MATTER WHAT A COP WAS. ALL THAT MATTERS ACCORDING TO
DONALD TRUMP IS MY ATTRACTIVE
LEVEL. DONALD TRUMP COMMENTS ABOUT OUR
APPEARANCES ARE TOO MANY TO REPEAT IT TO CRASH TO REPEAT. THEY ARE TOO IMPORTANT TO
IGNORE.
DONALD TRUMP CAN DISCOUNT OUR OUR COMPLIMENTS.
HE CAN DISRESPECT OUR ABILITY,
BUT COME NOVEMBER, HE CANNOT
DISREGARD OUR BOAT. THERE ARE SOME WHO WILL SAY I'M
VOTING FOR HILLARY CLINTON
BECAUSE SHE IS A WOMAN. PEOPLE WHO SAY THAT THIS IS MY VOICE AND HELLER'S LONG RECORD OF PUBLIC SERVICE. AND I KNOW THERE ARE SOME WHO
ARE CONTEMPLATING STAYING HOME THIS  NOVEMBER, YOUR VOICE CAN HELP TO FIND THE NEXT CHAPTER OF
AMERICAN VALUES, AMERICAN
POLICY, AMERICAN LEADERSHIP AROUND THE WORLD, FOR BETTER OR
FOR WORSE. I'M HERE TONIGHT TO ASK ALL OF
YOU TO JOIN ME TO NOT ONLY
OPPOSE DONALD TRUMP, BUT TO SUPPORT HILLARY CLINTON.
[CHEERS] BECAUSE WE ARE NOT JUST
DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS, WE
ARE AMERICANS.
[CHEERS] THANK YOU.
