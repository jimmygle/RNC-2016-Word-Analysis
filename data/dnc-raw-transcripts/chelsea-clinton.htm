<p class='short_transcript'> >> THANK YOU. THANK YOU.
[CHEERS] IT IS SUCH AN HONOR FOR ME TO BE
HERE TONIGHT. I'M HERE AS A PROUD AMERICAN, A PROUD DEMOCRAT, A PROUD MOTHER.
[CHEERS]<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> AND TONIGHT, IN PARTICULAR, AND VERY PROUD DAUGHTER.
[CHEERS] MARK AND I CAN'T QUITE BELIEVE IT, BUT OUR DAUGHTER CHARLOTTE IS NEARLY TWO YEARS OLD. SHE LOVED ELMO. SHE LOVES BLUEBERRIES AND ABOVE ALL, SHE LOVES FACE TIMING WITH GRANDMA.
[CHEERS] MY MOM CAN BE ABOUT TO WALK ON STAGE AND IT JUST IS NOT MATTER, SHE WILL DROP EVERYTHING FOR A FEW MINUTES OF BLOWING KISSES AND READING CHECK THE
TEMPERATURE TO -- CHUGGA CHUGGA CHO CHOO WITH HER GRANDDAUGHTER. OUR SON IS FIVE AND A HALF WEEKS
OLD.
[CHEERS] WE ARE SO THANKFUL THAT HE IS
HEALTHY AND THRIVING AND WE ARE BIASED, THAT WE THINK HE IS JUST
ABOUT THE CUTEST BABY IN THE
WORLD. A VIEW I'M SURE MY MOM SHARES.
AND EVERY DAY THAT I SPEND WITH
-- AS CHARLOTTE AND AIDEN'S
MOTHER.
., I THINK ABOUT MY OWN MOTHER.
MY WONDERFUL, THOUGHTFUL, HILARIOUS MOTHER. MY EARLIEST MEMORY IS MY MOM
PICKING ME UP AFTER I HAD FALLEN DOWN, GIVING ME A BIG TIME
INTEGRATING ME NINE MAN.
-- READING ME GOOD NIGHT MOON.
FROM THAT MOMENT AND THIS ONE,
EVERYTHING A MEMORY I HAVE OF MY MOM IS THAT REGARDLESS OF WHAT
WAS HAPPENING IN HER LIFE, SHE WAS ALWAYS THERE FOR ME.
[CHEERS] EVERY SOCCER GAME, EVERY SOFTBALL GAME, EVERY PIANO RECITAL, EVERY DANCE RECITAL. SUNDAY'S BEEN TOGETHER AT
CHURCH, THE LOCAL LIBRARY, COUNTLESS SATURDAYS AND
PUNISHMENTS IN THE CLOUDS.
MAKING UP STORIES ABOUT WHAT WE
WOULD DO IF WE MET A TRICERATOPS
IN MY OPINION, THE FRIENDLY'S LOOKING DINOSAUR ALTHOUGH MY MOTHER WOULD REMIND ME THAT THEY
WERE STILL DINOSAURS.
AS A KID I WAS OBSESSED WITH DINOSAURS AND THE DAY THAT MY
PARENTS TOOK ME TO DINOSAUR NATIONAL PARK, I DID NOT THINK
LIKE TO GET ANY BETTER. WHENEVER MY MOM WAS AWAY FOR WORK, WHICH THANKFULLY DID NOT
HAPPEN VERY OFTEN, SHE LET NOTES
FOR ME TO OPEN EVERY DAY SHE WAS GONE. ALL STACKED NEATLY TOGETHER IN A SPECIAL DRAWER WITH A DATE ON
THE FRONT OF EACH ONE SO I WOULD
KNOW WHICH NOTE TO OPEN ON WHICH
DAY. WHEN SHE WENT TO FRANCE TO LEARN
ABOUT THE CHILDCARE SYSTEM, I
REMEMBER ONE WAS ALL ABOUT THE EIFFEL TOWER.
ANOTHER WAS ABOUT THAT IDEAS SHE
HELPED TO BRING HOME TO HELP THE
KIDS OF ARKANSAS.
[CHEERS] I TREASURED EACH AND EVERYONE OF
THOSE NOTES. THEY WERE ANOTHER REMINDER THAT
I WAS ALWAYS IN HER THOUGHTS AND
HER HEART. GROWING UP, CONVERSATIONS AROUND
THE DINNER TABLE ALWAYS STARTED
WITH WHAT I LEARNED IN SCHOOL
THAT DAY. I REMEMBER ONE WEEK TALKING INCESSANTLY ABOUT A BOOK THAT
HAD CAPTURED MY IMAGINATION, A
WRINKLE IN TIME.
[CHEERS] ONLY AFTER MY PARENTS HAD
LISTENED TO ME WITH A THEN TALK ABOUT WHAT THEY WERE WORKING ON
.
EDUCATION, HEALTH CARE, WHAT
WITH CONSUMING THEIR DAYS AND
KEEPING THEM UP AT NIGHT. I LOVE THAT MY PARENTS EXPECTED ME TO HAVE OPINIONS AND TO BE
ABLE TO BACK THEM UP WITH FACTS.
[CHEERS] I NEVER ONCE DOUBTED THAT MY
PARENTS CARED ABOUT MY THOUGHTS
AND MY IDEAS INTO ALWAYS KNEW HOW DEEPLY THEY LOVE ME. THAT FEELING OF BEING VALUED AND LOVED, THAT IS WHAT MY MOM ONCE FOR EVERY CHILD.
[CHEERS] IT IS THE CALLING OF HER LIFE.
[CHEERS] MY PARENTS RAISED ME TO KNOW HOW
LUCKY I WAS THAT I NEVER HAD TO WORRY ABOUT FOOD ON THE TABLE,
THAT I NEVER HAD TO WORRY ABOUT A GOOD SCHOOL TO GO TO. NEVER HAD TO WORRY ABOUT A SAFE NEIGHBORHOOD TO PLAY IN. AND THEY TAUGHT ME TO CARE ABOUT
WHAT HAPPENS IN THE WORLD. AND TO DO WHATEVER I CAN TO
CHANGE WHAT FRUSTRATED ME. THEY TAUGHT ME THAT, THE
RESPONSIBLY THAT COMES WITH
BEING SMILED ON BY FATE.
[CHEERS] I KNOW MY KIDS ARE LITTLE YOUNG,
BUT I'M ALREADY TRYING TO
INSTILL THE SAME VALUES AND THEM
-- IN THEM.
[CHEERS] THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE THAT MY
MOTHER TAUGHT ME, PUBLIC SERVICE
IS ABOUT SERVICE.
[CHEERS] AS HER DAUGHTER, I'VE HAD A
SPECIAL WINDOW INTO HOW SHE SERVED. HOLDING THE HANDS OF MOTHERS WORRIED ABOUT HOW THEY WILL BE
THEIR KIDS, WORRIED ABOUT HOW THEY LOOK AT THE HEALTH CARE
THEY NEED.
MY MOTHER PROMISING TO DO
EVERYTHING SHE COULD TO HELP. I HAVE SEEN HER AFTER THOSE
CONVERSATIONS GETTING STRAIGHT
TO WORK.
FIGURING OUT WHAT SHE COULD DO, WHO SHE COULD CALL. HOW FAST SHE COULD GET RESULTS. SHE ALWAYS FEELS LIKE THERE
ISN'T A MOMENT TO LOSE BECAUSE SHE KNOWS THAT FOR THAT MOTHER, THAT FAMILY, THERE IS AN.
[CHEERS] I'VE SEEN HER AT THE LOW POINTS,
LIKE THE SUMMER OF 1994. SEVERAL PEOPLE THIS WEEK HAVE
TALKED ABOUT HER FIGHT FOR
UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE.
[CHEERS] I SAW IT UP CLOSE. IT WAS BRUISING. IT WAS EXHAUSTING.
SHE THOUGHT HER HEART OUT AND AS
ALL OF YOU KNOW, SHE LOST. FOR ME, 14 YEARS OLD, IT WAS
PRETTY TOUGH TO WATCH. BUT MY MOM, SHE WAS AMAZING. SHE TOOK A LITTLE TIME TO
REPLENISH YOUR SPIRIT, FAMILY
MOVIE NIGHT, DEFINITELY HELPED,
DAD, AS ALL OF YOU KNOW, LIKE POLICE ACADEMY.
[LAUGHTER] MY MOM AND I LOVED RIDING
PREJUDICE.
-- PRIDE AND PREJUDICE.
[CHEERS] AND THEN SHE GOT RIGHT BACK TO
WORK. BECAUSE SHE BELIEVED SHE COULD
SO MAKE A DIFFERENCE FOR KIDS.
-- STILL MAKE A DIFFERENCE FOR
KIDS.
[CHEERS] PEOPLE ASK ME ALL THE TIME, HAD
THE SHE DO A?
-- HOW DOES SHE DO IT? HOW DOES SHE KEEP GOING AMID THE
SOUND AND.
POLITICS? HERE IS HOW. SHE NEVER, EVER FORGETS WHO SHE IS FIGHTING FOR.
[CHEERS] SHE HAS WORKED TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR FOSTER KIDS TO NEVER -- TO GET ADOPTED. FOR 9/11 FIRST RESPONDERS TO GET THE HEALTH CARE THEY DESERVE.
[CHEERS] FOR WOMEN AROUND THE WORLD TO BE SAFE, TO BE TREATED WITH DIGNITY AND TO HAVE MORE OPPORTUNITY.
[CHEERS] FIGHTS LIKE THESE, THEY ARE WHAT KEEP MY MOTHER GOING. THEY GRABBED HER HEART. HER CONSCIENCE. AND THEY NEVER LET GO.
[CHEERS] THAT IS TO MY MOM'S. SHE'S A LISTENER, A DOER. SHE IS A WOMAN DRIVEN BY
COMPASSION, BY FAITH, BUT A
FIERCE SENSE OF JUSTICE AND A
HEART FULL OF LOVE.
[CHEERS] THIS NOVEMBER, I'M VOTING FOR A WOMAN AS A ROLE MODEL AND A
MOTHER. A WOMAN WHO HAS SPENT HER ENTIRE LIFE FIGHTING FOR FAMILIES AND CHILDREN.
I'M VOTING FOR THE PROGRESSIVES
WHO WILL PROTECT OUR FAMILY -- CLIMATE -- PLAINTIFF FR -- PLANET FROM CLIMATE CHANGE. IT WILL REFORM OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. AND WHO KNOWS THAT WOMEN'S RIGHTS ARE HUMAN RIGHTS.
[CHEERS] AND WHO KNOWS THAT LGBT WRITES
ARE HUMAN RIGHTS.
[CHEERS] HERE AT HOME, AND AROUND THE
WORLD, I'M VOTING FOR A FIGHTER
WHO NEVER EVER GIVES UP AND WHO BELIEVES WE CAN ALWAYS DO BETTER
WHEN WE COME TOGETHER AND WORK
TOGETHER. I HOPE THAT MY CHILDREN WILL
SOMEDAY BE AS PROUD OF ME AS I AM OF MY MOM. I AM SO GRATEFUL TO BE HER
DAUGHTER. I'M SO GRATEFUL THAT SHE IS
CHARLOTTE AND AIDAN'S
GRANDMOTHER. SHE MAKES ME PROUD EVERY SINGLE DAY.
[CHEERS] AND MOM, GRANDMA WOULD BE SO
PROUD OF YOU TONIGHT.
[CHEERS] TO EVERYONE WATCHING HERE AT HOME, I KNOW WITH ALL MY HEART
THAT MY MOTHER WILL MAKE US PROUD AS OUR NEXT PRESIDENT.
[CHEERS] THIS IS THE STORY OF MY MOTHER, HILLARY CLINTON.
