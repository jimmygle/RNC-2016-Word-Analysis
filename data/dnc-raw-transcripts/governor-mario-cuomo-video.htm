<strong>Unidentified Speaker</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> IN MANY WAYS WE ARE A SHINING CITY ON A HILL.
THE HARD TRUTH IS THAT NOT EVERYONE IS SHARING IN THE CITY DOES PLUNDER AND GLORY.
THERE IS ANOTHER PART<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> TO THE
SHINING CITY. THE PART WHERE SOME PEOPLE
CANNOT PAY THEIR MORTGAGES. AND MOST YOUNG PEOPLE CAN'T
AFFORD ONE.
WHERE STUDENTS CAN AFFORD THE
EDUCATION THEY NEED AND MIDDLE-CLASS PARENTS WATCH THE
DREAMS THEY OFFER THEIR CHILDREN
ABOUT RIGHT.
FUNDAMENTALLY, MY FATHER WAS
VERY CONCERNED ABOUT HOW PEOPLE
WERE TREATED AND THAT WAS THE
ARENA THAT DREW HIM IN. HE WAS ALWAYS THE SON OF AN
IMMIGRANT. HE WAS ALWAYS AN OUTSIDER. AND THAT WAS HIS EDGE. AND HE SAID, WHO CARES ABOUT
WHAT THE AUDIENCE WANTS TO HEAR.
IT IS ABOUT WHAT YOU NEED TO
SAY. I REMEMBER GOING TO WASHINGTON AND BEGGING FOR DOLLARS I REMEMBER GOING TO WASHINGTON
AND BEGGING. FOR A LITTLE MONEY FOR
TREATMENT. A LITTLE MONEY TO SAVE THESE
CHILDREN. THESE BATTLES WERE FOR REAL
CONSEQUENCES AND THEY MADE A
DIFFERENCE TO RAIL PEOPLE.</span><span class='hidden-full-transcript-ellipses'>...</span></p><a href='#' class='hidden-full-transcript-link'><i class='icon-chevron-down'></i> <span class='link-show-full-text'>Show Full Text</span><i class='icon-chevron-up'></i> <span class='link-show-less-text'>Show Less Text</span></a>
