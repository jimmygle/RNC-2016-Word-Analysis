<p class='short_transcript'> REP. BUTTERFIELD: FELLOW DEMOCRATS, I AM FROM NORTH
CAROLINA. IN MY COMMUNITY YOU JUDGE A MAN'S HEART BY HIS WORDS AND DEEDS. DONALD TRUMP YOUR WORDS<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> HAVE BEEN BIGOTED AND YOU HAVE USED EVERY OPPORTUNITY TO TALK ABOUT YOUR WELL. YOU ARE NOT QUALIFIED TO SERVE AS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED
STATES. YOU USE YOUR CELEBRITY STATUS TO PAINT A PICTURE OF GLOOM AND
DOOM. YOU USE YOUR STATUS TO ALIENATE
AFRICAN-AMERICANS AND OTHER
GROUPS. YOU WOULD USE THE OFFICES OF PRESIDENT TO TAKE OUR NATION IN
THE WRONG DIRECTION. YOU WANT TO KNOW YOUR POLLING
NUMBERS ARE SO DISMAL AMONG AFRICAN-AMERICANS, WE KNOW YOU HAVE GOTTEN RICH THROUGH YOUR
BUSINESS BUT WE ALSO KNOW YOUR WELL HAS COME AT THE EXPENSE OF
OTHER PEOPLE. WE KNOW YOU HAVE NO PLANS TO ADDRESS ISSUES THAT ARE AFFECTING AFRICAN-AMERICANS
COMMUNITIES SUCH AS GUN VIOLENCE AND HISTORICALLY BLACK COLLEGES AND -- READ OUR BLACK FORM AND
COMPARE IT TO THE REPUBLICAN PLATFORM.
GIVE US THIS CHANCE TO LEAD OUR
GREAT COUNTRY.</span><span class='hidden-full-transcript-ellipses'>...</span></p><a href='#' class='hidden-full-transcript-link'><i class='icon-chevron-down'></i> <span class='link-show-full-text'>Show Full Text</span><i class='icon-chevron-up'></i> <span class='link-show-less-text'>Show Less Text</span></a>

<strong>Andre D. Carson</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> FELLOW DEMOCRATS. MY NAME IS ANDRE CARSON AND I
STAND HERE TODAY NOT JUST AS A
REPRESENTATIVE OF THE GREAT
STATE OF INDIANA BUT AS A YOUNG
AFRICAN-AMERICAN<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> MUSLIM AND
FORMER POLICE OFFICER. MILLIONS OF LOYAL, GOOD HEARTED
PEOPLE HAVE WATCHED THE
DEEP-SEATED HATRED OF THE PAST
ONCE AGAIN BECOME MAINSTREAM. TOGETHER WE HAVE BEEN SINGLED OUT IN THE NATIONAL SPOTLIGHT AS
THREATS TO BE DEALT WITH AND NOT
A PART OF AMERICAN FAMILIES. THE DONALD TRUMP HAS THEIR WAY, THIS SLIDE INTO HATRED AND
BIGOTRY WILL ONLY GET WORSE. NOW I AM FROM INDIANA. I'VE SEEN MIKE PENCE'S TERRIBLE JUDGMENT OF -- UP CLOSE. HE IS AGAINST SAME-SEX COUPLES
HAVING EQUAL RIGHTS. HENCE -- FOR YEARS HE HAS FOUGHT
TO DEFUND PLANNED PARENTHOOD BOTH IN INDIANA AND ACROSS THIS
COUNTRY.
(BOOS) WE CANNOT LET THE TERRIBLE
JUDGMENT OF MIKE PENCE AND
DONALD TRUMP IMPACT OUR CIVIL
RIGHTS.
THAT IS WHY WE NEED HILLARY CLINTON! SHE BELIEVES THAT IF EVERY UNIFORM MAKES YOU FEEL THIS
SUSPICION. YOU DESERVE COMPASSION AND
UNDERSTANDING. HILLARY CLINTON IS UNDAUNTED. SHE STANDS WITH US AND WE NEED
YOU TO STAND WITH HER.</span><span class='hidden-full-transcript-ellipses'>...</span></p><a href='#' class='hidden-full-transcript-link'><i class='icon-chevron-down'></i> <span class='link-show-full-text'>Show Full Text</span><i class='icon-chevron-up'></i> <span class='link-show-less-text'>Show Less Text</span></a>

CALIFORNIA. DEMOCRATS, WE HAVE 100 AND THREE
DAYS TO SHOW THE NATION THAT THERE IS A BETTER PATH OR OUR
COUNTRY. 103 DAYS<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> TO ENSURE OUR NATION WILL NOT SLIDE BACKWARDS TO THE
BIGOTRY OF OUR PAST. 103 DAYS TO STOP OUR COUNTRY
FROM GIVING IN TO THE INCOHERENT RANGE WHICH TRUMP HAS TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF TO DECLARE WAR ON

OFFICER-INVOLVED SHOOTING'S.
WHEN YOU DEGRADE WOMEN, YOU
UNITE US. WE ARE DEMOCRATS AND WE EMBRACE THE FULL DIVERSITY OF THE
AMERICAN RAINBOW. THE DIVERSITY IN THIS ROOM

THE SOLDIERS OF GIANTS. SO MANY OTHERS. IT MAKES IT POSSIBLE FOR KIDS LIKE ME TO<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> SERVE IN THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS. IN AMERICA A FACE OF CLEAR
CHOICE. IT IS A CHOICE BETWEEN A
COMMANDER IN CHIEF AND A
BANKRUPT OR IN CHIEF. IT IS A CHOICE BETWEEN THE
SECRETARY OF STATE AND THE SECRETARY OF HATE. DONALD TRUMP -- HILLARY BELIEVES
THAT AMERICA IS A BETTER PLACE TODAY BECAUSE OF THE PRESIDENCY OF BARACK OBAMA. WE SHOULD PROVIDE FOR THE POOR AND WORK FOR WORKING FAMILIES
AND STAND UP FOR SENIOR CITIZENS. SHE WILL REVITALIZE RURAL AMERICA AND SHE WILL INCREASE
ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY -- AND ERADICATE POLICE BRUTALITY ONCE
AND FOR ALL.
SHE BELIEVES WHETHER YOU ARE
BLACK OR WHITE, LATINO OR ASIAN, AND JEWISH OR MUSLIM, CATHOLIC
OR PROTESTANT, GAY OR STRAIGHT, YOUNG OR OLD, EVERY SINGLE
AMERICAN DESERVES EQUAL
PROTECTION UNDER THE LAW AND THAT IS LIKE TOGETHER WE ARE
GOING TO ELECT HILLARY RODHAM

THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. GOD BLESS YOU.

MEEKS.
I AM HONORED TO UNITE AROUND OUR NOMINEE AND MY GOOD FRIEND HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON. I'VE SEEN THE TWO CANDIDATES UP
CLOSE<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> AND PERSONAL. LET ME TELL YOU HILLARY OFFERS EVERYTHING THAT DONALD TRUMP CANNOT. SHE FIGHTS FOR AMERICAN WORKERS. SHE PLANS TO MAKE COLLEGE DEBT-FREE FOR ALL.
THE CREATES AS M UNIVERSITY TO
EXPLOIT OTHERS. SHE OFFERS A VISION. DONALD SAYS I'M ALWAYS RIGHT. THE TRUTH IS, HE IS WRONG. HE IS WRONG FOR OUR FAMILIES AND OUR COMMUNITIES.
HE IS WRONG FOR OUR COUNTRY. HILLARY CLINTON IS GOING TO TACKLE INCOME INEQUALITY AND
PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE
POOR. SHE IS GOING TO INVEST IN COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE BEEN
NEGLECTED FOR FAR TOO LONG.
SO MY FELLOW AMERICANS, IT IS
TIME FOR US TO BAND TOGETHER. IT IS TIME FOR US TO AS FIRE. IT IS TIME FOR US TO BUILD A
STRONG FUTURE FOR OUR KIDS AND
OUR COUNTRY. WE CAN DO THAT BY ELECTING HER
TO THE WHITE HOUSE THIS NOVEMBER.
