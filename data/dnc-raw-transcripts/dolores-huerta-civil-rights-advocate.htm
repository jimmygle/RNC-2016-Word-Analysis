<strong>Unidentified Speaker</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> THANK YOU SO MUCH, CONGRESSMAN.
MY NAME IS SARAH MCBRIDE, AND I
AM A PROUD TRANSGENDERED AMERICAN. FOUR YEARS AGO, I CAME OUT A
STRAND GENDERED WHILE<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> SERVING AS
-- CAME OUT AS TRANSGENDERED
WHILE SERVING AS STUDENT BODY
PRESIDENT IN COLLEGE.
AT THE TIME COME I WAS SCARED.
I WAS WORRIED THAT MY DREAMS AND MY IDENTITY WERE MUTUALLY
EXCLUSIVE. SINCE THEN, I HAVE SEEN THE CHANGE IS POSSIBLE.
I WITNESSED HISTORY WHILE INTERNING AT THE WHITE HOUSE AND
HELPING MY HOME STATE OF
DELAWARE PASS PROTECTIONS FOR TRANSGENDERED PEOPLE. TODAY, I SEE THIS CHANGE IN THE WORK OF THE LGBT CAUCUS AND IN
MY OWN JOB AS PART OF THE HUMAN
RIGHTS CAMPAIGN.
DESPITE THIS PROGRESS, SO MUCH
WORK REMAINS.
WILL WE BE A NATION WHERE THERE
IS ONLY ONE WAY TO LOVE, ONLY
ONE WAY TO LOOK, ONLY ONE WAY TO
LIVE? OR WILL WE BE A NATION WHERE THERE IS MORE THAN ONE WAY TO
LIVE FREELY AND OPENLY? AND THEY -- A NATION THAT IS STRONGER TOGETHER?
THAT IS THE QUESTION. FOR ME, THIS STRUGGLE FOR
EQUALITY BECAME ALL THE MORE
URGENT WHEN I LEARNED THAT MY FUTURE HUSBAND, ANDREW, WAS BATTLING CANCER.
I MET ANDY, A TRANSGENDERED MAN
FIGHTING FOR EQUALITY, AND WE FELL IN LOVE.
EVEN IN THE FACE OF HIS TERMINAL
ILLNESS, HE NEVER WAVERED IN HIS
BELIEVE THAT THIS COUNTRY CAN
CHANGE. ANDY AND I MARRIED IN 2014.
JUST FOUR DAYS AFTER OUR WEDDING
HE PASSED AWAY. KNOWING A HANDY LEFT ME
PROFOUNDLY CHANGED, BUT MORE
THAN ANYTHING ELSE -- KNOWING ANDY LEFT ME PROFOUNDLY CHANGED, BUT MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE, IT MADE ME DETERMINED TO FIGHT FOR
WORLD WERE EVERYONE CAN LIVE TO
THEIR FULLEST. HILLARY CLINTON UNDERSTANDS THE
URGENCY OF OUR FIGHT. SHE WILL WORK WITH US TO PASS
THE EQUALITY ACT, TO COMBAT
VIOLENCE AGAINST TRANSGENDERED WOMEN OF COLOR,
AND TO END THE HIV-AIDS EPIDEMIC
ONCE AND FOR ALL. TODAY IN AMERICA, LGBTQ PEOPLE ARE STILL TARGETED I HATE THAT LIVES IN BOTH -- BY HATE THAT LIVES IN BOTH LAWS AND HEARTS. MANY STRUGGLE JUST TO GET BY. BUT I BELIEVE THAT TOMORROW CAN
BE DIFFERENT. TOMORROW, WE CAN BE RESPECTED AND PROTECTED, ESPECIALLY IF
HILLARY CLINTON IS OUR
PRESIDENT, AND THAT IS WHY I AM
PROUD TO STAND HERE AND THEY
THAT I WITH HER.
-- I'M WITH HER. THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH. CRACKS PLEASE WELCOME DOLORES FROM DAWSON, NEW MEXICO.</span><span class='hidden-full-transcript-ellipses'>...</span></p><a href='#' class='hidden-full-transcript-link'><i class='icon-chevron-down'></i> <span class='link-show-full-text'>Show Full Text</span><i class='icon-chevron-up'></i> <span class='link-show-less-text'>Show Less Text</span></a>

<strong>Unidentified Speaker</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> LIKE HILLARY CLINTON, I HAVE SPENT MY WHOLE LIFE FIGHTING FOR
WOMEN, FOR WORKERS, FOR IMMIGRANTS, FOR EVERY PERSON
THAT DOES NOT HAVE A VOICE. WITH<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> DONALD TRUMP ON THE BALLOT, HEY, WE CANNOT BE QUIET. HE INSULTS LATINOS AS IF WE WERE
SECOND-CLASS CITIZENS. LIKE WE ARE NEWCOMERS TO THIS
COUNTRY. HEY, I HAVE NEWS FOR DONALD TRUMP. WE HAVE BEEN HERE ALL ALONG. WE HELPED BUILD THIS COUNTRY AND
WE ARE STILL CONTINUING TO BUILD
THIS COUNTRY. MY GREAT-GRANDFATHER WAS IN THE
CIVIL WAR ON THE UNION SIDE. MY FATHER WAS A FARMWORKER, AND
ASSEMBLYMAN, A U.S. VETERAN LIKE
CESAR CHAVEZ, AND MY SON CONTINUES THAT TRADITION BY RUNNING FOR THE U.S. CONGRESS
FOR BAKERSFIELD, CALIFORNIA. NOW, LISTEN TO THIS. 800,000 LATINOS TURN 18 YEARS
OLD EVERY SINGLE YEAR. AND THEIR CONTRIBUTIONS TO SOCIAL SECURITY AND MEDICARE ARE
GOING TO ENSURE THAT OUR SENIORS HAVE THAT SAFETY NET. WE ARE NOT A FOOTNOTE IN AMERICAN HISTORY.
WE ARE HELPING TO WRITE HISTORY. AND WE ARE GOING TO TAKE OUR LATINO POWER, AND WE ARE GOING
TO USE IT IN NOVEMBER. OUR VOTES WILL INCREASE
PAYCHECKS, GET IMMIGRATION REFORM, SECURE REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS FOR WOMEN, BUT WE HAVE TO BE ACTIVE DEMOCRATS. BECAUSE EVERY DEMOCRAT NEEDS TO
BE AN ACTIVIST, OK? WE HAVE TO USE EVERY SINGLE MINUTE AS AN ORGANIZING MOMENT. WE HAVE TO USE EVERY SINGLE MOMENT TO GET VOTERS READY TO VOTE, TO EDUCATE THEM, TO KNOCK
ON THE DOOR, AND HEY, WE HAVE TO
MAKE SURE EVERYBODY GETS INVOLVED IN THIS ELECTION. AND PLEASE, REMIND EVERYBODY, ELECTION DAY IS THE MOST IMPORTANT DAY OF OUR LIFE. REMEMBER THIS. I HAVE KNOWN HILLARY CLINTON FOR
25 YEARS.
I HAVE WORKED WITH HER. THIS IS WHY I TRUST HER. DURING MY LIFETIME, HILLARY, AND THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY, THEY
HAVE ALWAYS BEEN WITH US, THE
LATINO COMMUNITY. WE HAVE TO PUT HILLARY IN THE
DRIVER SEAT. AND TIM KAINE, YOU KNOW WHAT? THEY WILL DRIVE US ON THE JOURNEY TO EQUALITY, BUT THEY
CAN'T DO IT ALONE. WE HAVE GOT TO BE THE ENERGY. WE HAVE GOT TO BE THE WHEELS. AND DONALD TRUMP, YOU NEED TO GET OUT OF THE WAY. AND IF HE DOESN'T, WE NEED TO
TAKE HIM OUT OF THE WAY. SO, WE WILL SHOW DONALD TRUMP
AND HIS REPUBLICAN FRIENDS WHO HAS THE POWER.
WHO'S GOT THE POWER? AND I WHITE YOU TO SAY VOTING
POWER.
WHAT KIND OF -- WANT YOU TO SAY VOTING POWER. WHAT KIND OF POWER?
VOTING POWER. ADD LET'S USE -- AND LESS USE OF
VOTING POWER IN NOVEMBER. CAN WE DO IT? SI SE PUEDE!
