<strong>Amy Klobuchar</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> HELLO, FRIENDS, HELLO, DEMOCRATS. I AM HERE TO MAKE THE CASE FOR A LEADER WHO, AS YOU JUST SAW, IS FOCUSED ON SECURITY FOR OUR COUNTRY, OUR ECONOMY,<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> AND OUR DEMOCRACY. A LEADER WHO KNOWS WE ARE ALL MORE SECURE WHEN WOMEN AND GIRLS
HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO LEAD
WITH THEIR HEADS HIGH AND THEIR STRIDE STRONG. THAT LEADER IS HILLARY CLINTON.
[APPLAUSE] SHE SEES A WORLD WHERE GIRLS ARE
NOT CAPTURED AND SOLD, BUT OUR FEARLESS AND BOLD, WHERE THEY LEAD AND NOT FOLLOW, AND WHERE
WHEN SOMEONE TELLS A YOUNG WOMAN
"YOU FIGHT LIKE A GIRL," PER
ANSWER IS "YES I DO AND I'M
PROUD TO BE THAT GIRL."
[APPLAUSE] NOW, DELEGATES, HERE IS ONE CHALLENGE. TODAY, MILLIONS OF PEOPLE IN THE WORLD ARE HELD ENFORCED LABOR OR
SEXUAL SERVITUDE. HUMAN TRAFFICKING HITS HOME FOR
ME.
I'M A FORMER PROSECUTOR. A FEW YEARS AGO, A 12-YEAR-OLD GIRL GOT A TEXT TO GO TO A
PARTY. A MAN PICKED HER UP IN A PARKING LOT AND RAPED HER. SHE ENDED UP IN A HOTEL AND WAS FORCED TO TAKE EXPLICIT PICTURES
OF HERSELF.
THEY WERE POSTED ONLINE AND THEN
SHE WAS SOLD TO TWO MORE MEN. THEY GOT THAT GUY. OUR JUSTICE DEPARTMENT AND LAW ENFORCEMENT WENT AFTER HIM.
[APPLAUSE] AND LAST DECEMBER, HE WAS
CONVICTED BY A JURY.
[APPLAUSE] SHE WAS 12 YEARS OLD, NOT OLD ENOUGH TO DRIVE A CAR OR GO TO
HER HIGH SCHOOL PROM, NOT OLD
ENOUGH TO VOTE. THIS IS HAPPENING IN OUR OWN COUNTRY.
THAT IS WHY AS SECRETARY OF STATE, HILLARY CLINTON TOOK THE INTERNATIONAL REPORT ON TRAFFICKING, THE ONE NATIONS
USED TO PROVE PROSECUTION AND
SHE MADE OUR COUNTRY A
ACCOUNTABLE. SHE ADDED THE UNITED STATES OF
AMERICA TO THAT LIST BECAUSE SHE
KNOWS THAT IF WE ARE GOING TO BE A BEACON FOR THE WORLD, WE HAVE TO GET OUR OWN HOUSE IN ORDER.
[APPLAUSE] AND WHEN HILLARY SAID HUMAN RIGHTS ARE WOMEN'S RIGHTS AND WOMEN'S RIGHTS ARE HUMAN RIGHTS, SHE NAMED SEX TRAFFICKING AS A
VIOLATION OF THOSE RIGHTS WAS
THAT SHE DIDN'T JUST SAY IT
ANYWHERE, SHE SAID IT IN CHINA. SHE CAME HOME FROM BEIJING AND SHE SUPPORTED THE FIRST TRAFFICKING LAW AND OUR COUNTRY.
YEARS LATER, SHE SUPPORTED MY
BIPARTISAN BILL THAT IS HELPING
LAW ENFORCEMENT CRACKDOWN ON
TRAFFICKING AND MAKE SURE THAT KIDS ARE TREATED AS THE VICTIMS
THEY ARE AND NOT AS CRIMINALS.
[APPLAUSE] FELLOW DELEGATES, HUMAN
TRAFFICKING IS THE THIRD BIGGEST CRIMINAL ENTERPRISE IN THE WORLD.
AS LONG AS ISIS IS SELLING GIRLS
FOR $165 AND PARENTS IN NIGERIA
ARE LEFT WITH NOTHING TO CHASE
THE TERRORISTS WHO STEAL THEIR
DAUGHTERS AND THE MIDDLE OF THE
NIGHT, WE WILL NEVER HAVE A JUST AND GOOD WORLD. BECAUSE WHEN WOMEN ARE HELD BACK, DEMOCRACY FALTERS. WHEN WOMEN ARE BOUND AND TREATED
AS SEX SLAVES, TYRANTS RULE.
OPPORTUNITY FOR WOMEN IS NOT A SIGN OF A COUNTRY'S WEAKNESS, IT
IS A SIGN OF A NATION'S
STRENGTH.
[APPLAUSE] MAYBE JUST MAYBE MARK TWAIN SET
US BACK. WHAT WOULD THEN BE WITHOUT WOMEN
? SCARCE. ELEVATING WOMEN ACROSS THE WORLD
SO THEY ARE TREATED WITH DIGNITY AND RESPECT, THAT IS WHAT
HILLARY CLINTON WILL DO AND IF THAT MEANS PLAYING THE WOMEN
CARD, DONALD TRUMP, LET ME TELL YOU, THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF WOMEN IN THIS WORLD WHO ARE READY TO PLAY THAT CARD. AND IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, ITS CALLED THE VOTING
CARD.
[APPLAUSE] PART OF HOW WE MAKE THIS BETTER
IS BY TELLING THE TRUTH, LAYING
OUT THE FACTS AND SHARING OUR
STORY.
HERE WITH US TONIGHT IS SOMEONE
WHO HAS EXPERIENCED THE
DEVASTATION OF HUMAN
TRAFFICKING. IT IS HARD TO PUT TO WORDS THE
HORSE SHE'S FACED BUT SHE HAS
THE COURAGE TO SPEAK OUT. WE ALL HAVE A VOICE.
THIS ELECTION, LET'S USE IT.
WE WELCOME YOU TO THE STAGE, IMA
.
