<strong>Harry Reid</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> SEN. REID: THANK YOU EVERYBODY. WINKY.
-- THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
(CHANTING) I SPENT A LOT OF TIME IN THE
REPUBLICAN SENATE.
IT IS NICE TO BE<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> IN A ROOM THAT RESPECTS REASON AND FACT. I APPRECIATE THIS TRIBUTE. I REALLY DO. ANYTHING I'VE ACCOMPLISHED IN THE SENATE, MY DEMOCRATIC SENATE CAUCUS, NANCY PELOSI IN THE
HOUSE. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA. VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN. I GET A NEVER ENDING TRIBUTE TO
HILLARY CLINTON. WE HAVE FOUGHT THAT AFFORDABLE
HEALTH CARE IS A RIGHT, NOT A
PRIVILEGE. WE FOUGHT FOR THE IDEA THAT YOU
SHOULDN'T GET THE BILL FOR WALL STREET'S BABETTE. AS A TEAM, WE FOUGHT FOR THE
PROMISE THAT YOUR HARD EARNED
SOCIAL SECURITY IS A SACRED TRUST. DONALD TRUMP AND MIKE PENCE WANT TO PUT INSURANCE COMPANIES BACK IN CHARGE OF YOUR HEALTH. DONALD TRUMP AND MIKE PENCE WANT TO LET BIG BANKS WERE -- RUN
WILD AGAIN. THEY WANT TO GAMBLE WITH YOUR RETIREMENT BENEFITS IN THE STOCK MARKET. REPUBLICANS WANT TO TEAR DOWN THE KILLERS OF MIDDLE-CLASS SECURITY. WE WON'T LET THAT HAPPEN.
[APPLAUSE] I HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING MORE
CRAVEN THAN MITCH MCCONNELL AND
WHAT HE HAS DONE TO OUR DEMOCRACY. HIS REPUBLICAN PARTY DECIDED
THAT THE ANSWER TO HARD-WORKING
DREAMS IS TO SLANDER OUR
AFRICAN-AMERICAN PRESIDENT.
TO STOKE FEAR OF MUSLIMS, TO
STOKE HATRED OF LATINOS AND OF
COURSE WAGE WAR AGAINST WOMEN. IN OTHER WORDS, THE ONLY THING
REPUBLICANS LIKE MITCH MCCONNELL
HAVE ACCOMPLISHED IS SETTING THE STAGE FOR A HATEFUL CON MAN,
DONALD TRUMP. WHEN DONALD TRUMP DECIDED TO RUN FOR PRESIDENT, HE PROBABLY SAID HIMSELF, I'M AN EGOMANIAC. I BELIEVE IN SCIENCE. I THINK WOMEN ARE INFERIOR. WHERE WOULD I FEEL AT HOME?
WE KNOW WHERE THAT IS. PARENTS, YOU ARE RIGHT TO FEAR
WHAT COMES OUT OF HIS MOUTH. REPUBLICANS, YOU SHOULD HAVE
BEEN CAREFUL ALSO. HE LEARNED IT FROM WATCHING YOU. THEY SAY THEY BELIEVE IN COUNTRY FIRST.
WHAT A JOKE. PUBLICANS THAT WON'T STAND UP TO TRUMP BELIEVE IN ONE THING ONLY. PARTY FIRST AND THIS YEAR, THEY
HAVE GONE EVEN FURTHER. NOMINATING THE POSTER CHILD OF ME FIRST. TRUMP KNEW THAT HATEFUL RHETORIC IS THE WAY TO WIN IN TODAY'S
GOP. THAT IS NOT HOW YOU WIN IN AMERICA AND THAT IS NOT HOW
AMERICA WINS IN THE WORLD. DEMOCRATS KNOW WE WIN WITH AN
ECONOMY THAT WORKS FOR EVERYBODY
, WITH A STRONG AND SMART NATIONAL SECURITY THAT DOES NOT
INVITE A CYBER ATTACK ON OUR
COUNTRY. WE KNOW THAT WINNING IS THE WORK
OF THE TEAM. WITH HILLARY AND THE WHITE HOUSE
AND A MAJORITY IN THE SENATE, DEMOCRATS WILL KEEP FIGHTING FOR
IMMIGRATION REFORM THAT KEEPS
AMERICA TRUE. CLEAN ENERGY AND ASSUME -- A
SUPREME COURT THAT KEEPS AMERICA JUST.
AND BACKGROUND CHECKS FOR GUN VIOLATORS AND AN ASSAULT WEAPONS
BAN THAT KEEPS AMERICA SAFE.
[APPLAUSE] SINCE MY DAYS, I HAVE FOUGHT MY
SHARE OF FIGHTS. I'VE ALSO REALIZED A LEADER IS
ACTUALLY A CORNER MAN, SOMEONE
THAT STANDS ON YOUR SIDE AND HAS
YOUR BACK IN A FIGHT. MIDDLE-CLASS LIFE. DEMOCRATS STAND IN YOUR CORNER. AMERICANS FIGHTING FOR EQUALITY AND RESPECT, WE ARE IN YOUR
CORNER. NEW AMERICANS RISKING EVERYTHING
TO GET HERE AND FIGHTING TO MAKE
IT HERE, WE ARE IN YOUR CORNER. YOU ARE THE ONES FIGHTING THE
HARDEST FIGHT.
YOU ARE THE ONES WHO NEED
LEADERS IN YOUR CORNER. LEADERS LIKE MY FOREVER FRIEND BERNIE SANDERS. LEADERS LIKE -- USE FUND HELP
DEMOCRATS TAKE BACK THE SENATE.
LEADERS TO NEVER BACK DOWN AND OH, DO WE LOVE KIM.
WE REALLY DO. LEADERS WHO HAVE HAD YOUR BACK
THEIR WHOLE LIVES, LIKE HILLARY
CLINTON.
THE MOST QUALIFIED CANDIDATE IN
THE HISTORY OF AMERICA. IN A FEW MONTHS, I WILL BE
STEPPING OUT OF THE RAIN -- RING
ONE LAST TIME. BUT DEMOCRATS WILL ALWAYS BE IN YOUR CORNER. TOGETHER BUT KEEP FIGHTING. FIGHTING THE GOOD FIGHT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
[CHEERS]
