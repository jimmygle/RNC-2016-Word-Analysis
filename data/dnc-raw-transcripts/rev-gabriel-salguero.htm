<strong>Gabriel A. Salguero</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> LET US PRAY. ALMIGHTY GOD, WE COME TO YOU TONIGHT BECAUSE WE RECOGNIZE OUR
DESPERATE NEED OF YOU. EACH OF US, DEMOCRATS, REPUBLICANS, INDEPENDENTS,<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> WE
KNOW THAT WE DEPEND ON YOU AND THAT YOU LOVE US ALL. AS WE WALKED TOWARDS THE AUTUMN OF ELECTION, WE PRAY YOU WILL GUIDE OUR GREAT NATION. LORD, HELP US TRANSCEND THIS TRAP OF CYNICISM, DESPAIR, AND
DIVISION.
WITH THE COURAGEOUS WORK OF HOPE AND LOVE. TEACH US TO CONTINUALLY -- CONTINUOUSLY CHAIRS AND
FERVENTLY DEFEND THE DIGNITY OF
EVERY HUMAN BEING. HELP US, GOD TO NEVER TIRED IN
THE WORK OF COMPASSION AND
JUSTICE. INSTRUCT US TO BE EVER MINDFUL OF THE MOST VULNERABLE AMONG US, THE CHILD, THE WIDOW, THE ORPHANS, THE IMMIGRANTS IN THE
REFUGEES. HELP US GOD FOR THE FUTURE OF
THE GREAT REPUBLIC FROM THE
BEDROCK OF LOVE. MAY OUR WORK REFLECT YOUR CHARACTER OF COMPASSION,
JUSTICE, AND STABILITY. MAY WE NEVER BE SATISFIED UNTIL
EVERY CHILD OF GOD HAS AN OPPORTUNITY TO FLOURISH. FROM PORTLAND TO PHILADELPHIA, FROM OUR SMALL TOWNS TO OUR
BENEFITS AND CITIES, FROM OUR POLICE OFFICERS TO OUR CHILDREN,
HELP US TO MOVE FORWARD IN
UNITY, A MORE PERFECT UNION THAT BELIEVES THAT DESPAIR AND VIOLENCE CAN NEVER CONQUER LOVE, HOPE, AND JUSTICE. AND LORD, HELP US TO DO THIS WORK TOGETHER FROM EVERY ETHNICITY AND COLOR, RICH AND POOR, WOMEN AND MEN, THE ELDERLY
AND THE YOUNG. WE CONFESS TONIGHT THAT WE ARE
OUR BROTHERS AND KEEPERS SISTER.
-- SISTER'S KEEPER. WE CAN DO MORE. GIVE US OPTIMISTIC TENACITY TO RESPOND TO SOME OF TODAY'S SPECIFIC CHASMS WITH ESPERANZA. HELP US TO NEVER CEASE UNTIL THE
NATION SEES THE DAY WHEN WE TRANSFORM DISCOURSED OF RACISM, XENOPHOBIA AND VIOLENCE INTO A BEAUTIFUL SYMPHONY OF BROTHERHOOD AND SISTERHOOD.
THIS I PRAY IN THE NAME OF JESUS, AMEN.</span><span class='hidden-full-transcript-ellipses'>...</span></p><a href='#' class='hidden-full-transcript-link'><i class='icon-chevron-down'></i> <span class='link-show-full-text'>Show Full Text</span><i class='icon-chevron-up'></i> <span class='link-show-less-text'>Show Less Text</span></a>
