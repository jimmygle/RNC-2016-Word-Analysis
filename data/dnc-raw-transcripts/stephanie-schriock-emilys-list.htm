<strong>Stephanie Schriock</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> MS. SCHRIOCK: 100 YEARS AGO THIS NOVEMBER A SOCIAL WORKER FROM MY HOME STATE OF MONTANA BECAME THE FIRST WOMAN ELECTED EVER TO CONGRESS. THE FIRST, BUT<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> NOT THE LAST. ONCE THAT BARRIER FELL THERE WAS
NO TURNING BACK. OVER 31 YEARS, EMILY'S LIST HAS ELECTED HUNDREDS OF MORE WOMEN
INTO THE HOUSE AND THE SENATE
AND EVERY OTHER OFFICE ON THE
BALLOT. EXCEPT ONE. HILLARY CLINTON BE OUR FIRST
WOMAN PRESIDENT. SHE WILL NOT BE OUR LAST. ONCE THAT BARRIER FALLS, IT WILL
NEVER BE PUT BACK UP. THE WOMEN WE HAVE ELECTED HAVE
NOT JUST BROUGHT NEW VOICES TO
THE DEBATE THEY HAVE BROUGHT NEW MOMENTUM TO THE PROGRESSIVE
MOVEMENT. WOMEN DON'T JUST FIGHT FOR WOMEN
. THEY FIGHT FOR FAMILIES, THEY
FIGHT FOR FAIRNESS, INCLUSION
AND JUSTICE. NO WONDER REPUBLICAN LEADERS
OPPOSE EQUAL PAY FOR WOMEN AND
REFUSE TO STAND UP FOR WORKING MOTHERS TO -- TRYING TO BALANCE
CAREER AND FAMILY. THAT IS WHY THEY LET YOUR BOSS
FIRE YOU FOR USING BIRTH CONTROL
AND FORCE US TO UNDERGO INVASIVE
TRANSVAGINAL ULTRASOUNDS. THEY DON'T RESPECT WOMEN. THEY DON'T TRUST WOMEN. THEY WANT TO CONTROL WOMEN. THEY ARE AFRAID OF THE CHANGE WE BRING, THE PROGRESS WE MAKE WHEN
WE GET A CHANCE TO LEAD. THEY ARE TERRIFIED OF HILLARY
CLINTON. NO MATTER WHAT THEY THROW AT HER, THEY HAVE NEVER BEEN ABLE
TO STOP HER. FROM LITTLE ROCK TO BEIJING, SHE FOUGHT FOR FAIRNESS, FOR
INCLUSION, FOR JUSTICE. SHE HAS ONE.
-- WON. THEY ARE MAKING THEIR LAST TO
STAND FOR ALL OF US FOR THOSE
WHO HAVE TRIED TO MAKE PROGRESS
IN AMERICA. THEY ARE DESPERATE, THAT MEANS
THEY ARE DANGEROUS -- THEY
NOMINATED A MAN WHO SAID WOMEN
SHOULD BE PUNISHED FOR HAVING AN
ABORTION. THAT -- WHO HAS CALLED US FAT CAKES AND ANIMALS.
HE PICKED A RUNNING MATE WHO LED
THE FIGHT TO DESTROY PLANNED PARENTHOOD AND TRY TO REDEFINE
RAPE AND SUGGEST THAT MOTHERS WHO WORK STUMP THE EMOTIONAL GROWTH OF THEIR KIDS BY PUTTING THEM IN DAY CARE.
IF THEY WIN, THEY WILL NEED EVERY OUNCE OF PROGRESS WE HAVE DARED TO MAKE. WE HAVE COME TOO FAR TO LET THAT
HAPPENED. LET US SELECT MORE DEMOCRATIC WOMEN OF AND DOWN THE BALLOT. MORE WOMEN IN THE HOUSE, MORE WOMEN IN THE SENATE.
I'M NOT TO TAKE THE MAJORITY. LET'S DECIDE RIGHT HERE AND NOW TO BREAK THROUGH THAT LAST
BARRIER. AND AT LONG LAST PUT A WOMAN IN
THE WHITE HOUSE. HILLARY CLINTON OUR FIRST WOMEN PRESIDENT. NOT OUR LAST.</span><span class='hidden-full-transcript-ellipses'>...</span></p><a href='#' class='hidden-full-transcript-link'><i class='icon-chevron-down'></i> <span class='link-show-full-text'>Show Full Text</span><i class='icon-chevron-up'></i> <span class='link-show-less-text'>Show Less Text</span></a>
