<strong>Daniele Mellott</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> HILLARY BEGAN WORKING ON
ADOPTION AND FOSTER CARE ISSUES AS A LAW STUDENT AND NEVER
STOPPED.
AS FIRST LADY, SHE ADVOCATED FOR
LANDMARK LEGISLATION<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> TO MAKE IT
EASIER FOR FAMILIES TO ADOPT
KIDS IN NEED, ESPECIALLY OLDER KIDS WHO WERE WORRIED THEY WOULD
NEVER HAVE A PERMANENT HOME. MY 17-YEAR-OLD SON WAS ONCE ONE
OF THOSE KIDS. WE ADOPTED HIM FOUR YEARS AGO
BUT IT FEELS LIKE HE'S ALWAYS
BEEN PART OF OUR FAMILY EVER.
MY THREE OTHER KIDS SWEAR HE WAS
ON FAMILY VACATIONS WE TOOK
YEARS BEFORE HE JOINED OUR
FAMILY. I'M NOT A DEMOCRAT BUT HILLARY CARES ABOUT KIDS LIKE HEATH AND
MAKING FAMILIES LIKE MINE COMPLETE.
THAT IS WHY I'M WITH HER.

<strong>Jelani Freeman</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> I'M JULY AND HE FREEMEN.
LONG BEFORE SHE EVER HELD ELECTED OFFICE, HILLARY FOUGHT
FOR KIDS IN EVERY WAY SHE COULD.
OF COURSE SHE CONTINUED THAT
FIGHT<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> ONCE SHE GOT TO THE
SENATE. I SPENT MY CHILDHOOD IN THE NEW
YORK FOSTER CARE SYSTEM MOVING
FROM HOME TO HOME WITH A TRASH
BAG AS MY SUITCASE. AND IF YOU ARE A KID IN THE
SYSTEM WHO NEVER FINDS A PERMANENT HOME, WHEN YOU ARE 18,
YOU ARE OUT ON YOUR OWN. AFTER MY HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATION, MY SOCIAL WORKER SHOOK MY HAND
AND WISHED ME LUCK. THAT WAS IT. BUT HILLARY HAS THIS RIDICULOUS NOTION THAT EVERY CHILD DESERVES
TO LIVE UP TO THEIR GOD-GIVEN POTENTIAL, SO SHE RESERVED AN INTERNSHIP SPOT IN HER SENATE OFFICE JUST FOR FORMER FOSTER YOUTH AND IN 2003, I GOT THAT SPOT.
[APPLAUSE] I REMEMBER OUR FIRST MEETING VIVIDLY.
SHE LOOKED ME IN THE EYE AND SAID "JULANI, I'M PROUD OF YOU." I FELT A SEEN AND HEARD FOR THE
FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE. THROUGHOUT THE YEARS, HILLARY
HAS REMAINED A SOURCE OF ENCOURAGEMENT. SHE HAS MADE ME MORE MINDFUL OF
MY RESPONSIBILITY AND PURPOSE.
HILLARY HAS TAUGHT ME THAT THERE IS A HIGH COST FOR LOW
EXPECTATIONS OF OUR KIDS AND TO RECEIVE A BLESSING TO BECOME A BLESSING. SHE INSPIRED ME TO BECOME A
LAWYER AND ADVOCATE FOR CHILDREN
IN MY COMMUNITY. IT IS SAID THAT LOVE DIGNIFY'S US, IT ELEVATES US TO HIGHER PLATEAUS. HILLARY'S LOVE DID THAT FOR ME.
IT LIFTED ME TO A PLACE I NEVER
HAD THE COURAGE TO IMAGINE AND
THAT IS WHY I'M WITH HER. THANK YOU.
