<strong>Jeff Merkley</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> HELLO, PHILADELPHIA! AND HELLO, OREGON!
[CHEERING] WASN'T DEMI LOVATO GREAT?
[CHEERING] I'M FROM A SMALL TOWN IN
SOUTHERN OREGON. I WAS THE FIRST IN<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> MY FAMILY TO
GO TO COLLEGE, I LIVED IN THE SAME BLUE-COLLAR COMMUNITY I
GREW UP IN. AND MY CHILDREN GO TO THE SAME
PUBLIC SCHOOLS I WITH -- I DID. HERE'S THE TRUTH.
DONALD TRUMP GOT RICH BY TAKING
ADVANTAGE OF AMERICANS LIKE THE
HARD-WORKING OREGONIANS AND MY
COMMUNITY BACK HOME. MAKING HIS PRODUCT OVERSEAS, HIRING FOREIGN WORKERS INSTEAD
OF AMERICANS FOR JOBS THAT ARE
RIGHT HERE IN THE UNITED STATES. TO GAIN SMALL BUSINESS CONTRACTOR'S, NEVER PAYING THEM
WHAT HE OWED.
AND SCAMMING PEOPLE OUT OF THEIR
-- THROUGH HIS FRAUDULENT
UNIVERSITY. WHERE I COME FROM, PEOPLE LIKE DONALD TRUMP ARE NOT THE
PROBLEM, -- NOT THE SOLUTION,
THEY ARE THE PROBLEM.
LASTLY, IN CLEVELAND, DONALD TRUMP CLAIMS HE IS A CHAMPION FOR AMERICAN WORKERS. BUT HE HAS NEVER WOKEN UP AND A
DAY IN HIS LIFE WORRYING ABOUT
AMERICAN WORKERS. HE IS NO MORE A CHAMPION FOR AMERICAN WORKERS BEEN A LINE IS A CHAMPION FOR GAZELLE.
-- THAN A LION IS A CHAMPION FOR
GAZELLE. I HEAR THE FRUSTRATIONS OF
PEOPLE BACK HOME TO WATCH
BILLIONAIRES GET RICHER WHILE THEY STRUGGLE TO FIND A JOB. STRUGGLE TO SEND THEIR KIDS TO
COLLEGE, STRUGGLE TO MAKE THEIR OWN RENT OR MORTGAGE. OUR RESPONSE TO THESE REAL CHALLENGES SHOULD NOT BE TO BLAME, TO BULLY, TO BE LITTLE, BUT TO RISE TO THE MOMENT WITH REAL SOLUTIONS. WE KNOW IN A NORM IS THAT TO BERNIE SANDERS THINKING OF
SOLUTIONS.
[CHEERING] BERNIE SANDERS INSPIRED US TO
REACH FOR BOTH SOLUTIONS WE
CHALLENGE AND FACE. BERNIE WAS A CAMPING ON
PROGRESSIVE ISSUES, HIS WILLINGNESS TO STAND UP TO THE POWERS THAT BE HAVE GALVANIZED A GRASSROOTS MOVEMENT THAT IS HERE TONIGHT AND WILL CONTINUE LONG AFTER  NOVEMBER AND WE NEEDED TO
CONTINUE LONG AFTER NOVEMBER.
[CHEERING] AND NOW, TOGETHER, WORKING TOGETHER, HILLARY CLINTON AND BERNIE SANDERS HAVE FORGED THE MOST AGGRESSIVE FORM IN OUR
PARTY'S HISTORY.
[CHEERING] AND WORKING TOGETHER, WE HAVE TO
JOIN THE FIGHT FOR TUITION FREE COLLEGE FOR WORKING AMERICANS.
[CHEERING] FOR A RENEWABLE ENERGY TO SAVE
OUR PLANET FROM CLIMATE CHANGE.
[CHEERING] WE NEED TO FIGHT TOGETHER TO OVERCOME CITIZENS UNITED.
[CHEERING] WE NEED TO FIGHT TOGETHER FOR
PASSAGE OF THE QUALITY ACT -- EQUALITY ACT FOR LGBTQ AMERICANS.
[CHEERING] WE NEED TO FIGHT TOGETHER WITH BERNIE AND HILLARY TO AND
PROFILING AND MASTECH
RESTORATION FROM COMMUNITIES OF
COLOR -- MASS INCARCERATION FOR
OUR COMMUNITIES OF COLOR.
[CHEERING] AND WE NEED TO FIGHT FOR TRADE POLICIES THAT PUT AMERICAN WORKERS VERSED, -- FIRST, WHICH MEANS WE MUST SAY NO TO FAST TRADE DEALS AND THAT INCLUDES THE TPP.
[CHEERING] TOGETHER, TOGETHER WE MUST FIGHT
FOR A GOVERNMENT OF, BY, AND FOR
THE PEOPLE.
NOT A GOVERNMENT FOR THE
POWERFUL. NOT A GOVERNMENT FOR THE
PRIVILEGED, BUT A GOVERNMENT FOR
THE PEOPLE. THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT WE ARE
GOING TO DO WHEN WE FOLLOW THE VISION OF BERNIE SANDERS AND HILLARY CLINTON AND ELECT HER,
HILLARY CLINTON AND TIM KAINE IN NOVEMBER.
[CHEERING] WE MUST BE UNITED IN THIS
BATTLE. WHETHER YOU SPEND THIS YEAR
FEELING THE BURN OR YOU FELT THIS YEAR READY FOR HILLARY, ALL OF US ARE READY FOR AN AMERICA THAT REJECTS DISCRIMINATION AND
EMBRACES DIVERSITY. THAT CELEBRATES BOTH FOR
EMPOWERMENT, NOT VOTER
SUPPRESSION. THAT CREATES OPPORTUNITIES FOR
ALL OF US, NOT JUST THE LUCKY FEW. LET'S WORK TOGETHER AS BERNIE
AND HILLARY HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT NEXT JANUARY, ON THE STEPS
OF THE CAPITOL, IT IS HILLARY CLINTON THAT WE ARE CELEBRATING TO BECOME THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THANK YOU SO MUCH AND GOD BLESS
YOU A GOOD NIGHT.
