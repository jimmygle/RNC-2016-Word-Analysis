<p class='short_transcript'> >> AL, GET OUT OF MY FRAME. AS SOME OF YOU KNOW I SUPPORT BERNIE SANDERS AND THE MOVEMENT BEHIND HIM.
[CHEERING] AND ERNIE HAS ALREADY SUCCEEDED
IN SO<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> MANY WAYS.
HE HAS PROVED THAT CITIZENS
UNITED IS IN FACT NOT A NECESSARY EVIL AND BY THE WAY, CITIZENS UNITED, IS IT THAT SUCH
A BEAUTIFUL NAME FOR SOMETHING
THAT MEANS BILLIONAIRES WIND POLITICIANS -- BUYING POLITICIANS? RAILS AGAINST OUR DEMOCRACY. I'M VERY GLAD THAT HILLARY HAS
BOWED TO OVERTURN IT.
[CHEERING] NOT ONLY DID BERNIE WAKE US UP,
HE MADE US UNDERSTAND WHAT IS
POSSIBLE AND WHAT WE DESERVE. MY SHRINK SAYS WE DON'T GET WHAT WE WANT, WE GET WHAT WE THINK WE DESERVE AND BERNIE SHOWED US
THAT ALL OF AMERICA CITIZENS DESERVE QUALITY HEALTH CARE AND
EDUCATION, NOT JUST THE WEALTHY ELITES.
[CHEERING] I KNOW, IT'S SOUNDS SO OBVIOUS.
WHO WOULD NOT AGREE WITH IT? I HAPPEN TO BELIEVE THE CRAZY
NOTION THAT PEOPLE WHO MAY BE NOT HAVE BORNE WITH THE SAME OPPORTUNITIES SHOULD BE GIVEN
THE SAME OPPORTUNITIES AS YOU
AND ME.
[CHEERING] AND ALL IT TAKES TO ACCOMPLISH THIS IS EVERYONE, ALL OF US, OR
AS A PRETTY KICK AS WOMAN SAID,
IT TAKES A VILLAGE.
[CHEERING] THIS DEMOCRATIC PRIMARY WAS EXEMPLARY.
NO NAME CALLING NO COMMENTS
ABOUT THE SIZE OF CANDIDATES
HANDS OR HOW MUCH THEY SWEAT OR
IF THEY GO TO THE BATHROOM, INSIDE SECRET, THEY DO.
[CHEERING] THAT IS FOR THIRD GRADERS.
COME ON. IT IS LIKE MAJOR ARRESTED
DEVELOPMENT STUFF. I'M STILL EMOTIONALLY FOUR AND
CALLING PEOPLE NAMES FROM MY GOLD ENCRUSTED SANDBOX BECAUSE I
WAS GIVEN MONEY.
[CHEERING] I DIGRESS. HILLARY HEARD THE PASSION OF THE PEOPLE, THE PEOPLE BEHIND BERNIE AND BROUGHT THOSE PASSIONS INTO THE PARTY'S PLATFORM AND THAT IS THE PROCESS OF DEMOCRACY AT ITS VERY BEST. AND IT IS VERY COOL TO SEE.
[CHEERING] HILLARY IS OUR DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE AND I WILL PROBABLY VOTE
FOR HER.
[CHEERING] IT IS SO INSPIRING, SO
INSPIRING.
JUST A FEW YEARS AGO, SHE WAS A
SECRETARY AND NOW SHE IS GOING
TO BE PRESIDENT.
[CHEERING] SHE IS LIKE THE ONLY PERSON EVER
TO BE OVERQUALIFIED FOR A JOB AS
THE PRESIDENT.
[CHEERING] I TELL YOU THIS, I WILL VOTE FOR
HILLARY WITH GUSTO.
[CHEERING] AS I CONTINUED TO BE INSPIRED AND MOVED TO ACTION BY THE IDEALS SET FORTH BY BERNIE WHO WHENEVER STOP FIGHTING FOR US.
-- WILL NEVER STOP FIGHTING FOR
US.
I'M PROUD TO BE A PART OF
BIRDIES MOVEMENT AND A VITAL
PART OF THAT MOVEMENT IS MAKING ABSOLUTELY SURE THAT HILLARY CLINTON IS OUR NEXT PRESIDENT OF
THE UNITED STATES.

<p class='short_transcript'> >> IN MANY WAYS WE ARE A SHINING CITY ON A HILL.
THE HARD TRUTH IS THAT NOT EVERYONE IS SHARING IN THE CITY DOES PLUNDER AND GLORY.
THERE IS ANOTHER PART<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> TO THE
SHINING CITY. THE PART WHERE SOME PEOPLE
CANNOT PAY THEIR MORTGAGES. AND MOST YOUNG PEOPLE CAN'T
AFFORD ONE.
WHERE STUDENTS CAN AFFORD THE
EDUCATION THEY NEED AND MIDDLE-CLASS PARENTS WATCH THE
DREAMS THEY OFFER THEIR CHILDREN
ABOUT RIGHT.
FUNDAMENTALLY, MY FATHER WAS
VERY CONCERNED ABOUT HOW PEOPLE
WERE TREATED AND THAT WAS THE
ARENA THAT DREW HIM IN. HE WAS ALWAYS THE SON OF AN
IMMIGRANT. HE WAS ALWAYS AN OUTSIDER. AND THAT WAS HIS EDGE. AND HE SAID, WHO CARES ABOUT
WHAT THE AUDIENCE WANTS TO HEAR.
IT IS ABOUT WHAT YOU NEED TO
SAY. I REMEMBER GOING TO WASHINGTON AND BEGGING FOR DOLLARS I REMEMBER GOING TO WASHINGTON
AND BEGGING. FOR A LITTLE MONEY FOR
TREATMENT. A LITTLE MONEY TO SAVE THESE
CHILDREN. THESE BATTLES WERE FOR REAL
CONSEQUENCES AND THEY MADE A
DIFFERENCE TO RAIL PEOPLE.</span><span class='hidden-full-transcript-ellipses'>...</span></p><a href='#' class='hidden-full-transcript-link'><i class='icon-chevron-down'></i> <span class='link-show-full-text'>Show Full Text</span><i class='icon-chevron-up'></i> <span class='link-show-less-text'>Show Less Text</span></a>
