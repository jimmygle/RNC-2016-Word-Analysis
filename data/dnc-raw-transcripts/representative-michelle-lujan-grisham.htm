<strong>Michelle Lujan Grisham</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> REP. GRISHAM: HELLO. WE HAVE A HISTORIC OPPORTUNITY TO ELECT A LEADER WHO IS READY
TO TACKLE ALL OF THE ISSUES THAT
WE FACE AS A NATION. BOTH AS COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF,<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> AND AS A MOTHER AND GRANDMOTHER WHO UNDERSTANDS THE CHALLENGES OF THE FAMILY. WE AS A NATION ARE UNDERSTANDABLY ANXIOUS ABOUT THE
VOLATILITY AROUND THE WORLD. I KNOW THAT I WANT AN EXPERIENCED AND LEVELHEADED PRESIDENT WHO KNOWS WHAT IT'S
LIKE TO MAKE DECISIONS IN THE WHITE HOUSE SITUATION ROOM. I TRUST HILLARY CLINTON TO MAKE US SAFE. AND I ALSO LOOK FORWARD TO THE DAY, AND I CAN SEE IT FROM HERE,
WHEN WE HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO KNOWS FIRSTHAND HOW WOMEN'S ECONOMIC SECURITY IS TIED TO THE ISSUES LIKE ACCESS TO WOMEN'S HEALTH CARE, EQUAL PAY FOR THE SAME WORK, AND LONG-TERM CARE
FOR OUR DISABLED CHILDREN AND
AGING PARENTS. WE HAVE A MOTTO IN CONGRESS, WHEN WOMEN SUCCEED, AMERICA SUCCEEDS. RIGHT? BUT THAT MOTTO DOESN'T SEEM TO MATTER TO DONALD TRUMP AND MIKE
PENCE. WE ALL KNOW HOW DONALD TRUMP TALKS ABOUT WOMEN. HE HAS SUGGESTED THAT WORKING
MOTHERS AREN'T GIVING 100% AT THEIR JOBS. HE HAS CALLED BREAST-FEEDING DISGUSTING. HE THINKS THAT EQUAL PAY FOR WOMEN TAKES AWAY FROM
"CAPITALISM." NOW HE HAS A RUNNING MATE WHO THINKS WOMEN BELONG IN THE HOME,
NOT RUNNING COMPANIES, NOT
SERVING IN THE MILITARY, AND
CERTAINLY NOT RUNNING THE COUNTRY.
[BOOS] LOOK, I'M INCREDIBLY FORTUNATE TO SERVE MY BELOVED CONSTITUENTS
IN NEW MEXICO AS A MEMBER OF
CONGRESS. BUT I'M ALSO THE PROUD MOTHER OF 2 INCREDIBLE DAUGHTERS. I AM GRANDMA TO MY BEAUTIFUL GRANDDAUGHTER AVERY. AND I AM THE PRIMARY CAREGIVER FOR MY MOM. CAREGIVING IS PART OF WHY YOU. THAT IS PART OF WHO I AM. BUT IT'S FINANCIALLY DRAINING. HILLARY CLINTON UNDERSTANDS WE
NEED TO SUPPORT THE MILLIONS OF FAMILIES WHO ARE CARING FOR
THEIR AGING OR DISABLED FAMILY
MEMBERS.
[APPLAUSE] SHE WILL FIGHT FOR AN AMERICA
WHERE EVERY WOMAN HAS THE
ECONOMIC SECURITY SHE NEEDS TO
LIVE THE LIFE THAT SHE WANTS AND DESERVES. I BELIEVE HER. WE BELIEVE HER. HILLARY CLINTON STANDS WITH US,
AND WE ARE WITH HER.
[APPLAUSE] AND WE WILL BE STRONGER AS A NATION WITH HILLARY CLINTON AS
THE NEXT PRESIDENT. THANK YOU.
