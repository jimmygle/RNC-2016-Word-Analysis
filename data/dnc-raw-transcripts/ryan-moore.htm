<strong>Ryan Moore</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> MY NAME IS RYAN MOORE, FROM NEBRASKA. MY FAMILY BEGAN OUR FRIENDSHIP
WITH HILLARY OVER 20 YEARS AGO.
BACK THEN, SHE WAS FIRST LADY,
FIGHTING FOR HEALTH<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> CARE REFORM. AS A PERSON WITH A RARE FORM OF DWARFISM, MY FAMILY KNEW MY LIFE
WOULD BE FILLED WITH SURGERY AND
HOSPITAL VISITS. SO, WE WERE GRATEFUL WHEN HILLARY ASKED TO HEAR OUR STORY. FOR ME, QUALITY, AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE WAS MORE THAN A PRIVILEGE, AND EVEN MORE THAN A
RIGHT.
IT WAS AN ABSOLUTE NECESSITY. I AM THANKFUL THAT SHE HAS KEPT
UP THE FIGHT OVER THE YEARS, AND
I AM HONORED TO CALL HER MY
FRIEND. HERE IS WHAT I CAN TELL YOU FROM
MY YEARS KNOWING HILLARY
CLINTON. SHE IS COMPASSIONATE. EVERY TIME I SEE HILLARY, SHE REMEMBERS MEANINGFUL DETAILS
ABOUT MY LIFE, SOMETIMES FROM
YEARS EARLIER. WHEN I FIRST MET HER, I WAS
SEVEN YEARS OLD AND WEARING A BACK BRACE.
TWO YEARS LATER WHEN I SAW HER AGAIN, SHE PATTED MY BACK AND SAID, YOU DON'T HAVE A BACK
BRACE ANYMORE.
I COULD NOT BELIEVE THAT SHE
REMEMBERED THAT. A LOT OF PEOPLE WOULD NOT HAVE.
A LOT OF PEOPLE WOULD NOT HAVE,
BUT SHE DID. EVERY TIME I HAD A BIG OPERATION COMING UP, I ALWAYS RECEIVE A NOTE FROM HILLARY OF
ENCOURAGEMENT AND KINDNESS. SHE LIFTS MY SPIRITS. SHE HELPS ME BELIEVE THAT
EVERYTHING IS GOING TO BE ALL
RIGHT. MOST OF ALL, SHE IS GENUINE. SOMETHING HAPPENED -- HAPPENS WHEN YOU MEET HILLARY.
NO MATTER HOW BUSY SHE IS, I'M
PRETTY SURE SHE'S ALWAYS REALLY BUSY, SHE MAKES YOU FEEL LIKE
THE MOST IMPORTANT PERSON IN HER
DAY. SHE BLOCKS EVERYTHING ELSE OUT
AND JUST FOCUSES ON ME, HOW MY
JOB IS GOING, HOW I'M FEELING. SHE REALLY CARES.
[APPLAUSE] AND I KNOW SO MANY WHO HAVE MET HERS SAY THE EXACT SAME THING. SHE ALWAYS LOOKS OUT FOR THE LITTLE GUY, NO PUN INTENDED. THAT'S WHY I'M SO PROUD TO
SUPPORT HILLARY CLINTON AS OUR NEXT PRESIDENT. THANK YOU.
