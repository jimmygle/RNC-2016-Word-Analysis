<strong>REPRESENTATIVE CASTRO</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> REPRESENTATIVE CASTRO: IN 1922,
THE ONLY GRANDPARENT THAT I
WOULD NEVER KNOW CAME TO THE
UNITED STATES FROM MEXICO. SHE WASN'T A RAPIST OR A MURDERER.<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> SHE WAS A SIX-YEAR-OLD ORPHAN. BUT AS A GIRL, SHE WALKED PAST STOREFRONT SIGNS THAT READ "NO DOGS OR MEXICANS ALLOWED." HER LIFE WASN'T EASY AND SHE DID
NOT ALWAYS FEEL WELCOME, BUT SHE
NEVER STOPPED BELIEVING IN AMERICA'S SACRED PROMISE THAT
HER SACRIFICES WOULD BE REWARDED
WITH OPPORTUNITY FOR HERSELF AND
HER FAMILY. SHE KEPT UP HER PART OF THAT
PROMISE BY WORKING HER WHOLE LIFE BABYSITTING, COOKING, AND
CLEANING HOUSES. AND THE FACT THAT HER GRANDSON IS STANDING HERE ON THIS STAGE
TONIGHT IS PROOF THAT AMERICA
KEPT ITS PROMISE, TOO.

<strong>REPRESENTATIVE CASTRO</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> REPRESENTATIVE CASTRO: FOUR
YEARS AGO, MY BROTHER JULIAN
STOOD ON THIS STAGE IN
CHARLOTTE.
HE AND I KNOW THAT OUR STORY IS
NOT UNIQUE.
THIS ROOM IS HELD<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> WITH MANY PROUD AMERICANS WHO CAN TELL
SIMILAR STORIES ABOUT THEIR OWN
FAMILIES.
RATE GRANDCHILDREN OF IRISH IMMIGRANTS WHO CAME TO CITIES LIKE NEW YORK AND BOSTON AND SAW SIGNS THAT READ "NO IRISH NEED
APPLY" AND "JUST WORK HARDER." JAPANESE WHO SUFFERED IN
INTERNMENT CAMPS, THE SAME CAMPS
DONALD TRUMP HAS DEFENDED, AND
GREW UP TO BE WAR HEROES, PUBLIC
SERVANTS. CHILDREN OF WAR HEROES WHO HAVE
CONTRIBUTED TO OUR COUNTRY AS DOCTORS, POLICE OFFICERS, AND
GUESS WHAT? EVEN IMPARTIAL JUDGES.

<p class='short_transcript'> REPRESENTATIVE CASTRO: THEIR
STORY IS OUR STORY. IT IS AMERICA'S STORY. AND MAKE NO MISTAKE -- THE HERO
OF THAT STORY IS NEVER THE ONE
WHO SIDES WITH<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> HATE.
THE HERO OF THAT STORY WILL
NEVER BE DONALD TRUMP. AMERICANS KNOW THAT THE CHOICES
HE OFFERS ARE FALSE ONES. IN AMERICA, PROSPERITY IS NOT A
ZERO-SUM GAME.
WE CAN CREATE MILLIONS OF NEW
JOBS AND WILL RAISE THE MINIMUM WAGE. NATIONAL SECURITY IS NOT A ZERO-SUM GAME.
WE CAN KEEP AMERICA SAFE AND STILL WELCOME THE NEXT
GENERATION OF IMMIGRANTS WITHOUT
A RELIGIOUS LITMUS TEST.
AND JUSTICE IS NOT A ZERO-SUM GAME. WE CAN BACK OUR BRAVE MEN AND WOMEN IN BLUE AND STILL BELIEVE
THAT BLACK LIVES MATTER.

<strong>REPRESENTATIVE CASTRO</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> REPRESENTATIVE CASTRO: THESE ARE
NOT ZERO-SUM GAMES.
IN FACT, THEY ARE NOT GAMES AT
ALL.
DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH DONALD
TRUMP HAD TO ACCOMPLISH THESE
THINGS?<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> ZERO.
WHILE DONALD TRUMP IS TALKING
ABOUT BUILDING WALLS, HILLARY
CLINTON IS WORKING TO BUILD AN
INFRASTRUCTURE OF OPPORTUNITY, A
WAVE OR AMERICANS TO GET TO
WHERE THEY WANT TO GO IN LIFE, GREAT SCHOOLS TO PREPARE US FOR COLLEGE AND A CAREER, A STRONG
HEALTH CARE SYSTEM -- AND I
DON'T CARE WHAT DONALD TRUMP OR
TED CRUZ OR ANYBODY ELSE SAYS -- THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT IS HERE
TO STAY BECAUSE IT IS SAVED MILLIONS OF AMERICAN LIVES. AND AN ECONOMY WHERE NO ONE WHO
WORKS FULL TIME AND WORKS HARD
LIVES IN POVERTY. REPUBLICANS WOULD HAVE YOU
BELIEVE THAT CREATING
OPPORTUNITY MEANS GIVING TAX
BREAKS TO CORPORATIONS AND THE
SUPER WEALTHY. WELL, I'VE MET A LOT OF AMERICANS IN MY LIFE, AND NO ONE
HAS EVER TOLD ME THAT THEIR
ANCESTORS CAME HERE LOOKING FOR THE LOWEST CORPORATE TAX RATE.
THE PROMISE OF AMERICA IS MUCH
BIGGER THAN THAT, AND THERE'S
ROOM IN IT -- THERE'S ROOM HERE
FOR EVERYONE. DONALD TRUMP IS NOT GOING TO KEEP THAT PROMISE.
HE'S NOT EVEN GOING TO TRY.
BUT HILLARY CLINTON AND TIM KAINE WILL. THAT'S WHY I'M ASKING ALL OF YOU
TO GO WILL IWILLVOTE.COM. MAKE SURE YOU ARE REGISTERED TO
VOTE. MAKE SURE THE NEXT CHAPTER OF OUR AMERICAN STORY IS WRITTEN BY
US.
MY GRANDMOTHER BELIEVED AMERICA IS THE GREATEST NATION IN THE WORLD, AND I'M WITH HILLARY SO THAT OUR GRANDKIDS WILL BELIEVE
THE SAME THING, TOO.
