<p class='short_transcript'> MAYOR DUGGAN: EVENING TILL IT
UP YET.
THANK YOU -- GOOD EVENING,
PHILADELPHIA. THANK YOU FOR THE EXTRAORDINAIRE
HOSPITALITY YOU HAVE SHOWN US
ALL WEEK.<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> TO MY FRIENDS IN MICHIGAN, THANK
YOU FOR THAT RECEPTION. I WAS BORN IN DETROIT AND FOR DECADES I WATCHED OUR CITY LOSE
TENS OF THOUSANDS OF JOBS.
I AM 58 YEARS OLD AND THE
POPULATION OF DETROIT HAS
DECLINED EVERY SINGLE YEAR I
HAVE BEEN ALIVE. BUT THAT IS CHANGING NOW. AS OUR CITY'S RECOVERY IS FUELED
BY A RENEWED SPIRIT OF UNITY AND
A COMMITMENT TO CREATING A COME BACK THAT INCLUDES ALL DETROITERS. THAT IS THE IDEA THAT DRIVES US,
AND IT DRIVES HILLARY CLINTON
BECAUSE WHEN SHE LOOKS AT DETROIT AND EVERY OTHER CITY IN AMERICA, SHE SEES THE
OPPORTUNITY TO CREATE AN ECONOMY
IN WHICH EVERYONE BENEFITS. THAT IS THE STRONG, STEADY
LEADERSHIP AMERICA NEEDS. WHEN I RAN FOR MAYOR OF DETROIT I RAN ON A MESSAGE THAT SAID WE
ARE GOING TO END OUR HISTORIC
DIVISION. EVERY NIGHT FOR AN ENTIRE YEAR I
FINISHED EVERY EVENT BY SAYING THIS, WE ARE GOING TO BUILD A
DETROIT WHERE IT NO LONGER
MATTERS IF YOU ARE BLACK, BROWN OR WHITE, WHERE IT NO LONGER MATTERS IF YOU ARE CHRISTIAN,
JEWISH, OR MUSLIM. WHERE HAD NO WATER -- NO LONGER MATTERS IF YOU'RE GAY, STRAIGHT, AN IMMIGRANT, BORN IN DETROIT,
EVERYBODY WILL BE EQUALLY VALUED
AND EVERYONE WILL HAVE REAL
OPPORTUNITY. AND WITH MY PARTNERS AT THE
DETROIT CITY COUNCIL, AND COUNCIL PRESIDENT BRENDA JONES, THAT IS THE CITY STARTING TO
EMERGE. DETROIT IS 18 MONTHS OUT OF
BANKRUPTCY. SOMETHING DONALD TRUMP KNOWS A
LITTLE BIT ABOUT. UNLIKE DONALD TRUMP, DETROIT IS
ONLY GOING TO SEE BANKRUPTCY
WANTS.
-- ONCE. THANKS TO A GREAT PARTNERSHIP
WITH PRESIDENT OBAMA, VICE
PRESIDENT BIDEN, AND THE ADMINISTRATION'S EXTRAORDINARY
ECONOMIC RECORD OF CREATING 14
MILLION NEW JOBS, JOBS ARE
RETURNING TO DETROIT. NEW AUTO PLANTS AND BUSINESSES
ARE OPENING.
IN DETROIT UNEMPLOYMENT RATES
HAVE BEEN CUT IN HALF. PEOPLE ARE MOVING BACK TO OUR
CITY IN HUGE NUMBERS. BUT DETROIT'S TRUE TEST IS THE
SAME TEST FACING THE NEXT
PRESIDENT. ARE WE CREATING AN ECONOMY THAT
WORKS FOR EVERYONE OR JUST FOR
THOSE AT THE TOP? IN FOUR NIGHTS IN CLEVELAND DID
YOU HEAR A SINGLE IDEA ON HOW TO DO THAT? DID YOU HEAR ANY PLAN TO PROTECT WORKING FAMILIES? NO. YOU HEARD INSULT AND FEAR
MONGERING. YOU HURT ANGRY, IRRATIONAL RHETORIC PARROTING A SLOGAN ON
HATS. COMPARE THAT TO WHAT YOU HEARD AND WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO HEAR FROM HILLARY CLINTON. CREATING GOOD PAYING JOBS BY
INVESTING IN INFRASTRUCTURE AND CLEAN ENERGY, OFFERING TAX CREDITS TO COMPANIES THAT CREATE
REAL JOB TRAINING FOR APPRENTICESHIP. HE WANTS TO MAKE COLLEGE DEBT-FREE AND SHE WANTS TO MAKE
-- REWARD COMPANIES THAT WERE
SHARE PROFITS WITH THEIR EMPLOYEES BECAUSE HILLARY
CLINTON KNOWS THE BEST WAY TO
BRING OUR CITIES BACK IS TO GET OUR CITIZENS ARE REAL CHANCE AT
GOOD PAYING JOBS. THAT IS WHY I WANT TO HELP HER BECOME THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE
UNITED STATES.
[CHEERS] I AM MAYOR BECAUSE THE POWER OF
PEOPLE GETTING ENGAGED, AND NO
MATTER WHERE YOU LIVE YOU CAN

HILLARY CLINTON.
THANK YOU.
