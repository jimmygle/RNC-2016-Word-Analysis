<p class='short_transcript'> >> GOOD EVENING. WE MEAN YOU NO HARM, THE LAST
WORDS. MY HERO. I GAVE -- TWO DAYS LATER I
FORGET THE SHOOTER. I REFUSE TO LATE HATE DESTROY ME
-- LET<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> HATE DESTROY ME.
[CHEERS] I HAVE ASKED, HOW WAS HE ABLE TO PURCHASE THE GUN HE USED TO KILL SO MANY? AFTER THAT DAY, HILLARY CLINTON CALLED ON LAWMAKERS TO CLOSE THE
CHARLESTON LOOPHOLE.
[CHEERS] BECAUSE, EVEN THOUGH THE SHOOTER
HAD AN ARREST RECORD, AS THE DAYS PASSED, HE COULD STILL BUY
THE GUN. NO ONE SHOULD FEEL WHAT I HAVE
SEEN. NO ONE SHOULD FEEL HOW WE FEEL. HOW WE SUFFERED. THE BIBLE TELLS US THAT PRAY AND TURN FROM OUR WICKED WAYS. GOD WILL FORGIVE US AND HEAL OUR

<p class='short_transcript'> OUR NATION.
[CHEERS] AMEN. TO HEAL WE MUST FORGIVE. THE SHOOTING IN CHARLESTON HAD HATE IN IS HOT.
THE SHOOTER AND HEART -- ORLANDO HAD HATE IN HIS HEART.
THE<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> SHOOTER IN DALLAS DID TOO.
SO MUCH HATE.
TOO MUCH. LOVE NEVER FAILS. IN THIS ELECTION, I CHOOSE
HILLARY CLINTON.
[CHEERS] HILLARY WAS IN SOUTH CAROLINA
THE DAY BEFORE THE SHOOTING AND
THE DATE THAT FOLLOWED, SHE TALKED ABOUT THE HATRED IN OUR NATION, THE RACISM, THE ADJUSTMENT. WE CAN'T HIDE FROM THE
SHOOTINGS. SHE CALLS ON US TO NAME THEM AND
TO CHANGE THEM. TOGETHER, WE CAN FIGHT FOR THAT
CHANGE. TOGETHER, WE CAN HEAL. TOGETHER WE CAN LOVE. THANK YOU.
