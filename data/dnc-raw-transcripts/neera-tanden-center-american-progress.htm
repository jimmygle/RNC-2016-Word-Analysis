<p class='short_transcript'> >> GOOD AFTERNOON. IT'S TRULY AN HONOR FOR ME TO
ADDRESS THIS CONVENTION. BECAUSE FRANKLY, I WOULD NOT BE HERE WITHOUT THE POLICIES OF THE
DEMOCRATIC<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> PARTY. MY PARENTS GOT DIVORCED WHEN I
WAS FIVE YEARS OLD.
MY FATHER LEFT FOR A TIME, IN MY
MOTHER HAD TO BE ON WELFARE. SHE WORKED HARD TO SUPPORT ME
AND MY BROTHER. WE ALSO HAD HELP. A LOT OF HEALTH. WE USED LUNCH OF VOUCHERS AT
SCHOOL AND FOOD STAMPS AT THE SUPERMARKET. AFTER WE MOVED OUT OF OUR HOUSE,
A FEDERAL SUBSIDY LETTUCE TO GET AN APARTMENT AND STAY IN A TOWN WITH GOOD PUBLIC SCHOOLS.
[APPLAUSE] IT WASN'T EASY, BUT WE
EVENTUALLY GOT BACK ON OUR FEET
BECAUSE OF THE INVESTMENT
DEMOCRATS HAVE MADE IN STRUGGLING FAMILIES. FAMILIES LIKE MINE. SO I KNOW FIRSTHAND THAT THE
DECISIONS OUR LEADERS MAKE MAKES
ALL THE DIFFERENCE IN PEOPLE'S
LIVES. THAT IS WHY I DIRECT PUBLIC POLICY, AND THAT IS WHY I AM SO
VERY PROUD TO SUPPORT HILLARY CLINTON. FOR DECADES, HILLARY HAS
CAMPAIGNED ON ISSUES THAT MATTER
TO WORKING FAMILIES. CHILDCARE, PAID LEAVE, EQUAL
PAY. BUT SHE DOESN'T JUST TALK THE TALK. SHE WALKS THE WALK. I KNOW BECAUSE I WORKED FOR HER
AND I STARTED MY OWN FAMILY. I WORKED FOR AN INTENSE SENATOR
WHEN MY DAUGHTER WAS YOUNG. NO MATTER HOW BUSY HILLARY GOT,
SHE ALWAYS MADE FAMILY FLEXIBILITY A REALITY FOR HER
STAFF. ONCE SHE FLIPPED HER ENTIRE
TRAVEL SCHEDULE SO I COULD MAKE
IT TO MY DAUGHTER'S PRE-K A
GRADUATION. IN FACT, HILLARY WAS THE SECOND PERSON TO CALL ME IN THE HOSPITAL WHEN MY BIRTH CHILD WAS
BORN. AND SHE WAS THE FIRST PERSON TO
CALL ME WHEN MY SECOND CHILD WAS
BORN. I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT SAYS ABOUT MY FAMILY, BUT I KNOW WHAT IT SAYS ABOUT HILLARY. SHE IS THERE FOR PEOPLE. SHE HAS HER BACK.
-- HAS YOUR BACK. WHAT YOU DO, NOT JUST WHAT YOU SAY, NOT AS. FOR HILLARY, POLITICS IS ABOUT
FIGHTING FOR PEOPLE, NOT WHEN THE CAMERAS ARE ON, BUT WHEN
THEY ARE OFF. BUT WHEN THE DECISIONS ARE EASY,
BUT WHEN THEY ARE HARD. SHE IS A LEADER WE CAN HAVE FAITH IN.
SHE WILL BE A PRESIDENT WE CAN COUNT ON TO ALWAYS. LET'S DO THIS IN  NOVEMBER.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.</span><span class='hidden-full-transcript-ellipses'>...</span></p><a href='#' class='hidden-full-transcript-link'><i class='icon-chevron-down'></i> <span class='link-show-full-text'>Show Full Text</span><i class='icon-chevron-up'></i> <span class='link-show-less-text'>Show Less Text</span></a>
