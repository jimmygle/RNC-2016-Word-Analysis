<strong>Christine Leinonen</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> IT TAKES ABOUT FIVE MINUTES
FOR CHURCH BELLS TO RING 49 TIMES. I KNOW THIS BECAUSE LAST MONTH, MY SON CHRISTOPHER AND HIS BOYFRIEND JUAN AND 47 OTHERS<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> WERE MURDERED AT A CLUB IN ORLANDO. CHRISTOPHER WAS MY ONLY CHILD. HE COULDN'T BE BETTER THAN
PERFECT.
[CHEERS] HE HAD SO MANY FRIENDS, TWO OF
WHOM ARE YOU TONIGHT REPRESENTING HUNDREDS AND
HUNDREDS MORE. ALL HIS LIFE HE BROUGHT PEOPLE
TOGETHER. IN HIGH SCHOOL, HE WON THE ANNE
FRANK HUMANITARIAN AWARD FOR
STARTING THE GAY STRAIGHT
ALLIANCE.
[CHEERS] CHRISTOPHER IS GRANDPARENTS MET
AND FELL IN LOVE IN A JAPANESE INTERNMENT CAMP.
IT WAS IN HIS DNA THAT LOVE ALWAYS TRUMPS HATE.
[CHEERS] CHRISTOPHER WAS A BIG HILLARY SUPPORTER.
THAT IS WHY I'M HERE. SO THAT I CAN TELL YOU ABOUT THE
DAY HE WAS BORN.
AT THE TIME, I WAS A MICHIGAN
STATE TROOPER.
[CHEERS] WHEN I WENT INTO LABOR, THE
HOSPITAL FOR MY OFF-DUTY GOT IN
A SAY. I DO NOT ARGUE. I KNOW COMMONSENSE GUN POLICIES
STABILIZE.
[CHEERS]
-- SAVE LIVES.
[CHEERS] THE WEAPON THAT MURDERED MY SON,
FIRED 30 ROUNDS IN ONE MINUTE. ORLANDO CITY COMMISSIONER POINTED OUT THE TERRIBLE MATH. ONE MINUTE FOR A GUN TO FIRE SOME A SHOT, FIVE MINUTES FOR
BELLS TO HONOR SOME ALLIES.
-- SO MANY LIVES. I'M GLAD COMMONSENSE GUN POLICY
WAS IN PLACE THE DAY HE WAS BORN.
BUT WHERE WAS THAT COMMON SENSE
THE DAY HE DIED?
[CHEERS] I NEVER WANT YOU TO ASK THE
QUESTION ABOUT YOUR CHILD. THAT IS WHY I SUPPORT HILLARY
CLINTON.
