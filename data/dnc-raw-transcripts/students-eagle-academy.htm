<strong>David Banks</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> GOOD EVENING.
ON THE PRESIDENT AND CEO OF THE
EAGLE ACADEMY IN NEW YORK.
[APPLAUSE] IN 2004, THE HIGH SCHOOL
GRADUATION RATE WAS ONLY AROUND 30%. AND<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> 75% OF NEW YORK STATE'S ENTIRE PRISON POPULATION CAME
FROM JUST SEVEN NEIGHBORHOODS IN
NEW YORK CITY. IF YOU ARE ONE OF THE YOUNG MEN
GROWING UP IN THESE AREAS, THE
ARTS WERE STACKED AGAINST YOU.
TOGETHER WITH THE ORGANIZATION,
100 BLACK MEN, WE ANSWERED THE CALL TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS CRISIS. SINCE 2004, THE EAGLE ACADEMIES HAVE EDUCATED NEARLY 4000 YOUNG
MEN. 98% OF OUR GRADUATES ARE
ACCEPTED TO COLLEGE.
[APPLAUSE] WE ARE MAKING A BIG DIFFERENCE NOW BUT WE COULD NOT HAVE DONE
IT ALONE. YOU COULD SEE THERE WAS ONE LEADER WHO WAS WITH US FROM THE
VERY BEGINNING AND SHE WAS OUR EARLIEST CHAMPION.
ONE LEADER WHO UNDERSTOOD THAT
ADDRESSING THE CRISIS FACING
YOUNG MEN OF COLOR IN OUR COUNTRY REQUIRED INNOVATIVE MEASURES, ONE LEADER WHO PUSHED TO OPEN THE FIRST EAGLE ACADEMY IN THE BRONX AND SHE MADE A
PROMISE TO RETURN FOUR YEARS LATER TO OFFER THE KEYNOTE
ADDRESS TO OUR FIRST GRADUATING CLASS.
AND THAT IS A PROMISE THAT SHE KEPT. YOU SEE, I'M WITH HILLARY CLINTON BECAUSE SHE HAS BEEN
WITH US.
[APPLAUSE] TODAY, WE HAVE YOUNG MEN WHO ARE CONFIDENT, FUTURE LEADERS WHO ARE RESILIENT. JUST LOOK AT THEM, AMERICA.
[APPLAUSE] THEY ARE BRILLIANT.
[APPLAUSE] AND FULL OF PROMISE. AND WE START EVERY DAY WITH THE POEM, THE SAME POEM THAT STRENGTHEN THE RESOLVE OF THE IMPRISONED NELSON MANDELA WHEN
HE RECITED IT EACH DAY SO YOUNG MEN OF THE EAGLE ACADEMY.</span><span class='hidden-full-transcript-ellipses'>...</span></p><a href='#' class='hidden-full-transcript-link'><i class='icon-chevron-down'></i> <span class='link-show-full-text'>Show Full Text</span><i class='icon-chevron-up'></i> <span class='link-show-less-text'>Show Less Text</span></a>

PROUD PARENT OF TWO AMAZING BOYS FOR THE AS YOU JUST HEARD, SHE
IS WINNING FIGHT FOR KIDS ALL OVER THE COUNTRY, OPENING<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> UP
OPPORTUNITIES THEY CANNOT EVEN
IMAGINE. FAR FROM THE SPOTLIGHT AND OVER HER ENTIRE CAREER, WHEN HILLARY
CLINTON SEES A PROBLEM, SHE
FIGHTS TO FIX IT. LIKE OUR JUSTICE SYSTEM LETTING DOWN TO MANY AMERICANS. HILLARY CLINTON BELIEVES THAT NO
MATTER WHERE YOU COME FROM,
WHERE YOU LIVE, OR THE COVER --
COLOR OF YOUR SKIN, YOU DESERVE
THE FULL FREEDOMS AND
PROTECTIONS OF OUR LAWS. THIS IS THE FIGHT OF HILLARY
CLINTON'S LIFE, SOCIAL JUSTICE.</span><span class='hidden-full-transcript-ellipses'>...</span></p><a href='#' class='hidden-full-transcript-link'><i class='icon-chevron-down'></i> <span class='link-show-full-text'>Show Full Text</span><i class='icon-chevron-up'></i> <span class='link-show-less-text'>Show Less Text</span></a>
