<strong>Unidentified Speaker</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> IF I HAD TO DESCRIBE PAT IN ONE WORD, IT WOULD BE LOVING. WE GREW UP AND GOT MARRIED AND
WE WERE 21.
HE WAS A FAMILY MAN. WHATEVER TIME HE WAS ABLE<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> TO
SPEND WITH US, HE WAS THERE.
WHATEVER HE CAN DO TO HELP THEM PROTECT, THAT IS WHAT HE
WANTED TO DO. IT'S ONE OF THE REASONS I FELL
IN LOVE WITH HIM.
HE REALIZED HE COULD DO THAT AND FLY IF HE JOINED THE ARMY. HE TOOK THE JOB VERY SERIOUSLY. ANY TIME HE WAS HOME HE ANSWERED
TO THAT LITTLE GIRL.
WE WERE HIS WORLD. PATRICK WAS IN IRAQ IN TWO DOZEN FOR.
HIS UNIT WAS CALLED OUT TO DO A
SEARCH AND RESCUE. PATRICK CRASHED TRYING TO SAVE
THE LIVES OF OTHERS. THAT WAS THE KIND OF PERSON HE WAS. I WAS NUMB. I LOST MY HUSBAND, MY BEST FRIEND, AND MY DAUGHTER LOST HER DAD. LOSING PAT SHOOK OUR FOUNDATION. IT WAS LIKE, OK, WHAT DO WE DO NEXT? HILLARY CLINTON RELEASED SOME OF
THE FINANCIAL STRESS. Y -- IT ALLOWED ME TO FOCUS ON ME AND MY DAUGHTER, TO HEAL,
TO GIVE HER A STABLE HOME. WHAT HILLARY HAS DONE FOR OUR FAMILY AND OTHER MILITARY FAMILIES, WORDS CAN'T EVEN DESCRIBE IT. SHE UNDERSTANDS WHAT OUR COUNTRY
NEEDS. 12 YEARS AGO SHE UNDERSTOOD WHAT
OUR FAMILY NEEDED. SHE HAVE THE GUMPTION TO GET
THINGS DONE. THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT YOU WANT
AND OUR PRESIDENT.
-- IN OUR PRESIDENT.
