<strong>Lee Daniels</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> I'M HERE BECAUSE THE NEXT
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
INVITED ME.
[CHEERS] I WAS SCARED AT FIRST.
I WONDERED IF HILLARY REALLY NEW HIGHLIGHT WAS<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> -- WHO I WAS.
NOT JUST THE WORK AT
ENTERTAINMENT, BUT WHO I REALLY
AM. WHO IS LEADING ELSE? -- LEE
DANIELS? DOES SHE KNOW THAT MY SISTERS UNDER HOUSE ARREST? DOES SHE KNOW THAT MY BROTHER IS IN JAIL? DOES SHE KNOW THAT MY NEPHEW IS
IN JAIL. BUT MY COUSINS ARE IN AND OUT OF
JAIL? THAT MY FATHER WAS A POLICE
OFFICER SHOT AND MURDERED RIGHT HERE IN PHILADELPHIA WHEN I WAS
15? THIS EVEN KNOW THAT I'VE BEEN TO
JAIL? THAT AT THE AMERICA I KNOW. AND STILL I RISE.
[CHEERS] IT HIT ME LIKE A BRICK.
HILLARY DOES IT. THAT IS WHAT GAVE ME THE COURAGE
T O COME AND SPEAK IN FRONT OF Y' ALL TONIGHT. HILLARY HAS DONE WITH FAMILIES WHO HAVE STOOD WITH PEOPLE DUE TO GUN VIOLENCE. SHE HELPED TURN THEIR HEART
ACHING TO ACTION. I WISH HE WAS AROUND FOR ME WHEN
MY DAD DIED.
-- SHE WAS AROUND FOR ME WHEN MY
DAD DIED. HILLARY UNDERSTAND OUR RIGHT TO
BEAR GUNS, BUT WAS TO STOP GUNS
FROM CUTTING INTO THE WRONG
HANDS.
-- FROM GETTING INTO THE WRONG
HANDS.
[CHEERS] 33,000 AMERICANS DIE EACH YEAR
FROM GUN VIOLENCE. THAT IS 90 PEOPLE A DAY. ENOUGH.
[CHEERS] WE NEED TO TAKE ACTION.
AND WE NEED TO TAKE ACTION NOW. THERE IS ONLY ONE CANDIDATE
WILLING TO TAKE ON THE GUN LOBBY
AND KEEP OUR FAMILIES SAFE.
[CHEERS] I'M BAD AT THIS TELEPROMPTER
STUFF. AND FOR THAT, MILLENNIALS, WHO
COME FROM WHERE I COME FROM, WHO
DOESN'T THINK THAT YOU HAVE A VOICE, YOU DO. AND THERE AINT'T NO CHOICE. THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT
ELECTION OF OUR LIFETIME. COME NOVEMBER, VOTE FOR HER. MAY GOD BLESS YOU, HILLARY
CLINTON. AND GODLESS AMERICA.
-- GOD BLESS AMERICA.

<strong>Christine Leinonen</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> IT TAKES ABOUT FIVE MINUTES
FOR CHURCH BELLS TO RING 49 TIMES. I KNOW THIS BECAUSE LAST MONTH, MY SON CHRISTOPHER AND HIS BOYFRIEND JUAN AND 47 OTHERS<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> WERE MURDERED AT A CLUB IN ORLANDO. CHRISTOPHER WAS MY ONLY CHILD. HE COULDN'T BE BETTER THAN
PERFECT.
[CHEERS] HE HAD SO MANY FRIENDS, TWO OF
WHOM ARE YOU TONIGHT REPRESENTING HUNDREDS AND
HUNDREDS MORE. ALL HIS LIFE HE BROUGHT PEOPLE
TOGETHER. IN HIGH SCHOOL, HE WON THE ANNE
FRANK HUMANITARIAN AWARD FOR
STARTING THE GAY STRAIGHT
ALLIANCE.
[CHEERS] CHRISTOPHER IS GRANDPARENTS MET
AND FELL IN LOVE IN A JAPANESE INTERNMENT CAMP.
IT WAS IN HIS DNA THAT LOVE ALWAYS TRUMPS HATE.
[CHEERS] CHRISTOPHER WAS A BIG HILLARY SUPPORTER.
THAT IS WHY I'M HERE. SO THAT I CAN TELL YOU ABOUT THE
DAY HE WAS BORN.
AT THE TIME, I WAS A MICHIGAN
STATE TROOPER.
[CHEERS] WHEN I WENT INTO LABOR, THE
HOSPITAL FOR MY OFF-DUTY GOT IN
A SAY. I DO NOT ARGUE. I KNOW COMMONSENSE GUN POLICIES
STABILIZE.
[CHEERS]
-- SAVE LIVES.
[CHEERS] THE WEAPON THAT MURDERED MY SON,
FIRED 30 ROUNDS IN ONE MINUTE. ORLANDO CITY COMMISSIONER POINTED OUT THE TERRIBLE MATH. ONE MINUTE FOR A GUN TO FIRE SOME A SHOT, FIVE MINUTES FOR
BELLS TO HONOR SOME ALLIES.
-- SO MANY LIVES. I'M GLAD COMMONSENSE GUN POLICY
WAS IN PLACE THE DAY HE WAS BORN.
BUT WHERE WAS THAT COMMON SENSE
THE DAY HE DIED?
[CHEERS] I NEVER WANT YOU TO ASK THE
QUESTION ABOUT YOUR CHILD. THAT IS WHY I SUPPORT HILLARY
CLINTON.
