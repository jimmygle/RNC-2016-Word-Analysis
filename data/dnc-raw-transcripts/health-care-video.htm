<strong>Joe Crowley</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> PLEASE WELCOME TO THE PODIUM,
REPRESENTATIVE JOSEPH CROWLEY
FROM NEW YORK. CRAIG IT WAS A BEAUTIFUL DAY,
NOT A CLOUD IN THE SKY, IT WAS
JUST AFTER<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> 9:00 A.M. AND I WAS WAITING ON THE RUNWAY AT
LAGUARDIA TO FLY BACK TO
WASHINGTON. THEN I GOT THE NEWS. TWO PLANES HAD CRASHED INTO THE
WORLD TRADE CENTER. I RACED OUT OF THE TERMINAL. I TRIED CALLING MY TWO COUSINS, BOTH MEMBERS OF THE NEW YORK CITY FIRE DEPARTMENT. WE HAD GROWN UP TOGETHER IN WORKING-CLASS QUEENS, NEW YORK.
THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO BE OFF
DUTY THAT DAY, BUT THEN THE CALL
CAME IN. BOTH BROTHERS RESPONDED. ONLY ONE CAME HOME. ON SEPTEMBER 12, I STOOD AT WHAT HAD BEEN THE WORLD TRADE CENTER.
ALL THAT REMAINED WAS SMOKE AND
ASH. MY COUSIN, BATTALION CHIEF JOHN
MORAN, WAS LISTED AMONG THE
MISSING, BUT DEEP DOWN, I KNEW
HE WASN'T COMING HOME. NEITHER WERE THE OTHER 300 42
MISSING FIREFIGHTERS.
THE WEIGHT OF THE LOSS WAS
HEAVY. BUT THERE BY MY SIDE WAS HILLARY
CLINTON. HILLARY CLINTON, THE NEW YORK
SENATOR.
HILLARY CLINTON, MY FRIEND. SHE UNDERSTOOD THE PAIN MY FAMILY, OUR CITY, OUR NATION OR
UNDER.
SHE FOUGHT TO HELP OUR CITY REBUILT, AND SHE DELIVERED. PEOPLE FORGET, BUT THE
ASSISTANCE PACKAGE THAT WAS
FIRST PROPOSED DIDN'T HAVE A DIME, NOT A DIME FOR NEW YORK. HILLARY HELPED TURN THAT AROUND, SECURING $20 BILLION WE NEEDED
TO HELP GET NEW YORK GOING
AGAIN. BUT SHE DIDN'T STOP THERE. HUNDREDS WORKED ON THE PILE IN THE DAYS AFTER 9/11. FIRST, THEY CAME TO FIND
SURVIVORS, BUT EVENTUALLY
SEARCHED FOR REMAINS. THEY DIDN'T WORRY ABOUT THEIR
OWN HEALTH. THEY WERE TOLD THE AIR WAS FINE,
BUT IT WASN'T. AND WHEN HEALTH ISSUES EMERGED
YEARS LATER, HILLARY CLINTON WAS
STILL BY THEIR SIDE. SHE BROUGHT FAMILIES AND FIRST
RESPONDERS TO WASHINGTON.
SHE TOOK THEM DOOR TO DOOR,
NEVER LETTING HER COLLEAGUES
FORGET THE CONSEQUENCES OF THAT
TERRIBLE DAY.
FOR ALMOST A DECADE, HILLARY NEVER GAVE UP, AND SHE WAS THERE
FOR US WHEN THE 9/11 HEALTH AND COMPENSATION ACT WAS FINALLY PASSED.
[APPLAUSE] BUT LET ME ASK YOU SOMETHING. WHERE THIS DONALD TRUMP -- WHERE
WAS DONALD TRUMP IN THE DAYS, AND MONTHS, AND YEARS AFTER
9/11? HE DIDN'T STAND AT THE PILE.
HE DIDN'T LOBBY CONGRESS FOR
HELP. HE DIDN'T FIGHT FOR THE FIRST
RESPONDERS.
NOPE. HE CASHED IN, COLLECTING 100
$50,000 IN FEDERAL FUNDS
INTENDED TO HELP SMALL BUSINESSES RECOVER, EVEN THOUGH
DAYS AFTER THE ATTACK, TRUMP
SAID HIS PROPERTIES WERE NOT
AFFECTED. HILLARY SOUGHT THOSE FUNDS TO HELP LOCAL MOM AND POP SHOPS GET BACK ON THEIR FEET. DONALD TRUMP SAW IT AS A PAYDAY FOR HIS EMPIRE. IT WAS ONE OF OUR NATION'S DARKEST DAYS, BUT FOR TRUMP, IT WAS JUST ANOTHER CHANCE TO MAKE
A QUICK BUCK. HILLARY HAS NEVER AND WILL NEVER
FORGET THE REALITY OF THAT DAY, AND THAT IS WHY SHE WILL NEVER
GIVE UP ON MAKING US A BETTER AND STRONGER NATION. MY COUSIN JOHN CARRIED WITH HIM A QUOTE FROM TEDDY ROOSEVELT. IT READS IN PART, IT IS NOT THE
CRITIC WHO COUNTS, NOT THE MAN WHO POINTS OUT HOW THE STRONG MAN STUMBLED OR HAVE A GOOD DEEDS COULD HAVE BEEN DONE BETTER.
THE CREDIT BELONGS TO THE MAN WHO WAS IN THE ARENA, WHO
STRIVED VALIANTLY. MY FRIENDS, THIS IS THE HILLARY
CLINTON I KNOW, THE DOER OF DEEDS, WHO I STOOD, AND WORKED, AND FOUGHT ALONGSIDE.
THIS IS THE HILLARY CLINTON I BELIEVE IN, THE PROVEN FIGHTER WHO HAS DEVOTED HERSELF TO
HELPING AMERICAN FAMILIES,
AMERICAN WORKERS, COPS,
FIREFIGHTERS, HELPING ALL AMERICANS. AND THIS IS THE HILLARY CLINTON I SUPPORT, THE ONE WHO HAS BEEN IN THE ARENA, WHO KNOWS WHAT IT
WILL TAKE TO KEEP AMERICA SAFE, TO DEFEAT AND DESTROY ISIS, AND
WHO HAS DEMONSTRATED THE
LEADERSHIP AND THE DETERMINATION
WE NEED IN OUR NEXT RESIDENT.
MY FELLOW DEMOCRATS, MY FELLOW AMERICANS, -- OUR NEXT
PRESIDENT. MY FELLOW DEMOCRATS, MY FELLOW
AMERICANS, I'M WITH HER, I'M WITH HILLARY, BECAUSE HILLARY
HAS ALWAYS BEEN WITH US.</span><span class='hidden-full-transcript-ellipses'>...</span></p><a href='#' class='hidden-full-transcript-link'><i class='icon-chevron-down'></i> <span class='link-show-full-text'>Show Full Text</span><i class='icon-chevron-up'></i> <span class='link-show-less-text'>Show Less Text</span></a>

<p class='short_transcript'> ELIZABETH BANKS: WHEN I FIRST STARTED MY ACTING CAREER, I WAS
THE TYPICAL WAITRESS.
AND I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT WHEN I
PLAYED A WAITRESS ON "ALL MY CHILDREN."<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> I ATE A LOT OF BAGELS FOR BRUNCH
BECAUSE I COULD NOT AFFORD BOTH BREAKFAST AND LUNCH. ALSO, I DIDN'T HAVE HEALTH
INSURANCE. MY DOCTOR WAS AT PLANNED
PARENTHOOD WERE THEY LET ME PAY ON A SLIDING SCALE AND WHERE
THEY UNDERSTOOD MY LADY BITS. BUT IF I GOT A MAJOR ILLNESS, I
WAS OUT OF LUCK, AND I KNOW
MILLIONS OF PEOPLE HAVE A
SIMILAR STORY.
BUT I ALSO KNOW THIS. HILLARY CLINTON HAS FOUGHT FOR
AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE FOR DECADES. CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE --
HILLARY CLINTON. LOWER PRESCRIPTION COSTS --
HILLARY CLINTON. EXPANDED HEALTH COVERAGE FOR PEOPLE WHO NEED IT MOST --
HILLARY CLINTON.
