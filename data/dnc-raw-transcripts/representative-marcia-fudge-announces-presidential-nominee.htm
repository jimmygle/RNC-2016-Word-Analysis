<strong>Terry McAuliffe</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, PLEASE WELCOME GOVERNOR TERRY, FROM VIRGINIA.
-- TERRY MCAULIFFE, FROM
VIRGINIA. HELLO, DEMOCRATS. THIS IS AN EXTRAORDINARY DAY.
IT<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> IS A DAY THAT WILL CHANGE THE
POLITICAL HISTORY OF OUR
COUNTRY. IT IS THE END OF ONE CHAPTER AND THE BEGINNING OF ANOTHER. IT IS A DAY YOU WILL REMEMBER
FOREVER BECAUSE YOU WILL BE ABLE
TO SAY I WAS THERE WHEN WE
NOMINATED HILLARY CLINTON TO BE
THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. MORE IMPORTANTLY, WHEN WE MADE HISTORY, WHEN WE SELECTED -- AND I AM SO PROUD TO ANNOUNCE IT FOR THE FIRST TIME -- THE FIRST
WOMAN NOMINEE IN AMERICAN HISTORY TO LEAD OUR PARTY TO THE WHITE HOUSE -- WHEN WE SELECTED
A NOMINEE WHO HAS FOUGHT HER
WHOLE LIFE FOR GREATER JUSTICE, EQUALITY, AND OPPORTUNITY FOR
EVERY SINGLE AMERICAN, WHEN WE
SELECTED A NOMINEE WHO DOESN'T JUST TALK ABOUT MAKING AMERICA
STRONGER AROUND THE WORLD, SHE IS THE ONLY CANDIDATE WITH A SPECIFIC PLAN TO WORK WITH OUR
ALLIES AND TO FIGHT ISIS ALL
OVER THE GLOBE, MY FRIENDS,
HILLARY CLINTON IS A NOMINEE WHO
IS READY TO STAND UP TO THE
HATRED AND THE FEAR MONGERING AND SEND DONALD TRUMP BACK TO
HIS BANKRUPT CASINOS WHERE HE
BELONGS.
[APPLAUSE] OF COURSE, I WOULD BE REMISS IF I DID NOT PRAISE HILLARY FOR HER EXCELLENT JUDGMENT IN SELECTING
MY FRIEND AND FELLOW VIRGINIAN, TIM KAINE, TO BE THE NEXT VICE
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. AND YOU CAN SUPPORT THAT EFFORT
RIGHT NOW BY GOING TO HILLARY CLINTON -- HILLARYCLINTON.COM. NOW FOLKS, I HAVE KNOWN HILLARY
AND HER HUSBAND BILL FOR MORE
THAN HALF MY LIFE.
I LOVE THIS WOMAN.
I STILL REMEMBER HER PLAYING
MERMAID IN THE POOL WITH OUR YOUNGEST DAUGHTER, SALLY, FOR
HOURS ON FAMILY VACATIONS. I WAS PROUD. SHE WAS THE FIRST PERSON TO CALL
AND CONGRATULATE OUR OLDEST SON, JACK, WHEN HE BEGAN HIS CAREER
AS AN OFFICER IN THE UNITED
STATES MARINE CORPS, AND I WILL
NEVER FORGET WHEN SHE AND THEN PRESIDENT CLINTON DID NOT
HESITATE TO TRAVEL THROUGH A
BLIZZARD TO ATTEND MY FATHER'S
FUNERAL. THAT IS SOMETHING YOU WILL NEVER FORGET.
THAT IS FRIENDSHIP. HILLARY IS TOUGH. SHE IS DETERMINED. SHE IS AN AMAZING MOTHER,
GRANDMOTHER, AND WIFE.
AND I KNOW THAT SHE LOVES THIS
COUNTRY MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE. COMPARE THAT TO WHAT WE JUST
HEARD FROM DONALD TRUMP AND THE
REPUBLICANS. THEY SPENT FOUR DAYS TEARING DOWN OUR COUNTRY. THEY BLAME IMMIGRANTS. THEY BLAMED REFUGEES.
THEY BLAMED AFFORDABLE HEALTH
CARE AND OFFERED NO SOLUTIONS OTHER THAN GIVING THE NUCLEAR CODES TO A MAN WHO PRAISES VLADIMIR PUTIN AND SADDAM
HUSSEIN. IF DONALD TRUMP REALLY CARED
ABOUT AMERICAN GREATNESS, HE
WOULD NOT ATTACK DEMOCRATS. HE WOULD FOLLOW OUR LEAD. IN VIRGINIA, WE ARE BRINGING THE
UNEMPLOYMENT RATE DOWN FROM 5.3% WHEN I TOOK OFFICE TO 3.7% TODAY, THE STEEPEST DECLINE IN
32 YEARS IN VIRGINIA. WE HAVE MADE RECORD INVESTMENTS
IN PUBLIC EDUCATION, EXPANDED ACCESS SO THAT WE HAVE A
HEALTHY, NUTRITIOUS PLAN FOR ALL
OF OUR CHILDREN.
AND LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING,
WE WERE THE FIRST STATE IN THE
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA TO END VETERANS HOMELESSNESS IN OUR
STATE. WE HAVE THOUGHT REPUBLICAN EFFORTS TO DISCRIMINATE AGAINST
LGBT VIRGINIANS, AND -- FOUGHT REPUBLICAN EFFORTS TO
DISCRIMINATE AGAINST LGBT
VIRGINIA HAS AND WE HAVE STOOD
UP FOR A WOMAN'S RIGHT TO
CHOOSE. WE ARE OVERCOMING OBSTACLES THAT
DENY HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF
FORMER FELONS THEIR RIGHT TO VOTE BECAUSE HISTORY TELLS US
THAT ENEMIES OF PROGRESS TENDS
LOW THE MARCH TOWARD JUSTICE AND DASH CAM SLOW THE MARCH TOWARD
JUSTICE AND EQUALITY, BUT THEY
-- CAN SLOW THE MARCH TOWARD JUSTICE AND EQUALITY, BUT THEY CANNOT STOP US.
WE HAVE COME SO FAR SINCE 2008,
BUT WE HAVE MUCH MORE TO BE
DONE. THAT IS WHY I SUPPORT HILLARY
CLINTON. WE NEED A PRESIDENT WHO TACKLES GLOBAL WARMING HEAD-ON AND STANDS UP FOR COMMON SENSE SOLUTIONS TO KEEP GUNS AWAY FROM
DANGEROUS PEOPLE, A PRESIDENT
WHO HAS VISION, PURPOSE, AND THE
EXPERIENCE TO LEAD OUR NATION, NOT CHEESY SLOGANS AND SILLY
HATS. A PRESIDENT WHO WILL BILL OUR COUNTRY UP -- BUILD OUR COUNTRY
UP AND NOT TEAR IT DOWN TO SCARE
FOLKS. I HAVE KNOWN HILLARY FOR
DECADES.
I HAVE SEEN HER IN ACTION.
I KNOW SHE WILL BE THE KIND OF
LEADER SHE WILL BE AND SHE WILL
LEAD THIS NATION. TONIGHT, WE MADE HISTORY, AND
THE FIGHT HAS JUST BEGUN.
IT IS TIME FOR ALL OF US TO GET
TO WORK AND TO MAKE MY FRIEND,
HILLARY CLINTON, THE NEXT
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
OF AMERICA.
THANK YOU.</span><span class='hidden-full-transcript-ellipses'>...</span></p><a href='#' class='hidden-full-transcript-link'><i class='icon-chevron-down'></i> <span class='link-show-full-text'>Show Full Text</span><i class='icon-chevron-up'></i> <span class='link-show-less-text'>Show Less Text</span></a>
