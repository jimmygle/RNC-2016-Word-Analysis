<strong>Cecile Richards</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> PLANNED PARENTHOOD WAS FOUNDED 100 YEARS AGO. GIVING WOMEN THE CARE THEY NEED TO LIVE THEIR LIVES AND CHASE THEIR DREAMS, NO LIMITS, NO CEILINGS.
A<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> CENTURY LATER, AN ENORMOUS
FEELING IS COMING DOWN -- AN ENORMOUS FEELING IS COMING DOWN.
BUT THIS YEAR IS NOT JUST ABOUT ELECTING THE FIRST WOMAN
PRESIDENT, IT'S ABOUT ELECTING
THIS WOMAN PRESIDENT. EACH YEAR, MILLIONS OF PEOPLE TRUST PLANNED PARENTHOOD, AND
THE PLANNED PARENTHOOD ACTION
FUND TRUSTS HILLARY CLINTON.
AS FIRST LADY, HILLARY CLINTON
DECLARED TO THE WORLD THAT WOMEN'S RIGHTS ARE HUMAN RIGHTS.
SHE WORKED WITH REPUBLICANS AND
DEMOCRATS TO HELP CREATE THE CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM, WHICH NOW COVERS 8
MILLION KIDS.
AS SECRETARY OF STATE, SHE WAS A CHAMPION TO WOMEN AND GIRLS
AROUND THE GLOBE, AND SHE WILL
ALWAYS STAND UP FOR THE RIGHTS OF EVERY WOMAN TO ACCESS A FULL RANGE OF REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH
CARE, INCLUDING ABORTION, NO MATTER HER REPRODUCTIVE STATUS.
OVER THE LAST YEAR, HILLARY HAS
TRAVELED ACROSS OUR COUNTRY LISTENING TO YOUNG ACTIVISTS,
WORKING TO END CAMPUS SEXUAL ASSAULT. SHE HAS LISTENED TO FATHERS WHO WANT THEIR DAUGHTERS TO BE PAID
EQUALLY TO THEIR SONS. AND TO PARENTS WHO NEED PAID
LEAVE AND AFFORDABLE CHILDCARE. AND SHE HAS MADE THEIR FIGHT HER
OWN.
AND SHE HAS CHOSEN AS A RUNNING MATE SENATOR TIM KAINE. A MAN WHO HAS BEEN A CHAMPION FOR WOMEN AND FAMILIES HIS
ENTIRE LIFETIME. HILLARY HAS ALWAYS BEEN AN
PLANNED PARENTHOOD'S CORNER
BECAUSE SHE KNOWS WOMEN DESERVE SOMEONE WHO IS IN THEIRS.
WOMEN LIKE DANA, A MOM IN DALLAS WHO WAS DIAGNOSED WITH BREAST CANCER TWO YEARS AGO.
TODAY, DANA IS CANCER FREE, AND
SHE SAYS SHE COULD NOT HAVE DONE IT WITHOUT VIVIAN, THE PLANNED PARENTHOOD CLINICIAN WHO STUCK
WITH HER ALL THE WAY THROUGH
TREATMENT. SO, WHEN DONALD TRUMP AND MIKE PENCE SAY THEY WILL DEFUND
PLANNED PARENTHOOD, THEY ARE TALKING ABOUT CUTTING WOMEN LIKE
DANA OFF OF LIFE-SAVING CARE. MAKE NO DOUBT ABOUT IT, WOMEN'S
HEALTH AND LIVES ARE ON THE LINE AND ON THE BALLOT THIS ELECTION. YOU MAY HAVE HEARD THAT THE
SUPREME COURT RULED THAT THE
TAXES LAWS THAT FORCED ABORTION PROVIDERS TO CLOSE TO BEAR -- CLOSE THEIR DOORS ARE DANGEROUS AND UNCONSTITUTIONAL. BUT THE FIGHT IS NOT OVER. DONALD HAS PLEDGED TO APPOINT JUSTICES WHO WILL OVERTURN ROE VERSUS WADE AND UNDO DECADES OF PROGRESS.
DONALD TRUMP HAS CALLED WOMEN
FAT PIGS AND DOGS.
HE WANTS TO PUNISH WOMEN FOR HAVING ABORTIONS. HE CALLS PREGNANCY A
"INCONVENIENCE" FOR WOMEN'S EMPLOYERS.
WELL, MR. TRUMP, COME THIS NOVEMBER, WOMEN ARE GOING TO BE
A LOT MORE THAN AN INCONVENIENCE. WOMEN ARE GOING TO BE THE REASON
YOU'RE NOT ELECTED PRESIDENT. WHEN MY GREAT-GRANDMOTHER WAS
GROWING UP, WOMEN COULD NOT VOTE, UNDER TEXAS LAW.
JUST TWO GENERATIONS LATER, HER GRANDDAUGHTER, AND RICHARDS, MY
MOTHER, WAS ELECTED GOVERNOR OF
THE STATE OF TEXAS. TONIGHT, WE ARE CLOSER THAN EVER
TO PUTTING A WOMAN IN THE WHITE
HOUSE.
I CAN ALMOST HEAR MOM SAYING,
"WELL, IT SURE TOOK YOU A LONG ENOUGH." SO, WHAT DO YOU SAY? ARE YOU READY TO MAKE HISTORY? LET'S GO WIN THIS ELECTION.
THANK YOU.</span><span class='hidden-full-transcript-ellipses'>...</span></p><a href='#' class='hidden-full-transcript-link'><i class='icon-chevron-down'></i> <span class='link-show-full-text'>Show Full Text</span><i class='icon-chevron-up'></i> <span class='link-show-less-text'>Show Less Text</span></a>
