<strong>Unidentified Speaker</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> THIS IS MY VERY FIRST DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL CONVENTION.
[APPLAUSE]
>> AND THIS  NOVEMBER, I WILL BE
VOTING IN MY VERY FIRST GENERAL ELECTION.
[APPLAUSE]<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> AND I AM SO EXCITED TO BE ABLE
TO SAY MY FIRST VOTE FOR
PRESIDENT WILL BE FOR HILLARY
CLINTON.
[APPLAUSE] YOU SEE, I REGISTERED TO VOTE AT THE DMV ON THE SAME DAY I GOT MY
DRIVERS LICENSE. IT GAVE ME THE POWER OF A LIFETIME, THE POWER TO MAKE MY VOICE HEARD AND TO SHAPE THE
FUTURE OF OUR COUNTRY. I AM A MILLENNIAL, A MEMBER OF
[LAUGHTER] A MEMBER OF THE LARGEST GENERATION OF AMERICANS BORN
AFTER THE BABY BOOMERS. BUT FOUR OUT OF FIVE YOUNG
PEOPLE ACTUALLY STAYED HOME IN THE 2014 CONGRESSIONAL ELECTION. SO JUST IMAGINE, IMAGINE WHAT CAN HAPPEN IF WE ALL MAKE OUR
VOICES HEARD THIS NOVEMBER AT
THE BALLOT BOX.
[APPLAUSE] WE CAN ELECT IN A PRESIDENT WHO
WILL FIGHT TO GIVE EVERY AMERICAN A CHANCE TO GRADUATE FROM COLLEGE DEBT-FREE. WE CAN ELECT A PRESIDENT WHO
WILL FIGHT FOR EQUAL PAY AND
EQUAL WORK.
[APPLAUSE] MY AMAZING MOTHER BECAME A SINGLE-PARENT WHEN I WAS JUST 13 YEARS OLD. AND IT WASN'T EASY.
SHE HAD TO BALANCE A JOB AND
CARING FOR HER ENTIRE FAMILY. BUT IMAGINE THE DIFFERENCE EQUAL
PAY CAN MAKE FOR TODAY'S WORKING
MOMS AND THEIR FAMILIES.
[APPLAUSE] SO LISTEN, IF YOU HAVE NOT
REGISTERED TO VOTE YET, GET REGISTERED RIGHT AWAY. CHECK OUT IWILLVOTE.COM FOR EVEN MORE INFORMATION, AND MAKE YOUR YOU ARE REGISTERED.
DON'T MISS THIS CHANCE TO MAKE

HILLARY CLINTON IS THE NEXT
PRESIDENT OF UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THANK YOU.
[APPLAUSE]
