<strong>Unidentified Speaker</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> HELLO, AMERICA.
IT'S AN HONOR TO REPRESENT
COLORADO. MY FAMILY'S HOME FOR SIX
GENERATIONS. IN COLORADO, WE SHARE A UNIQUE HERITAGE BUILT ON THE PROMISE<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> OF
PROGRESS. YOU CAN ONLY FIND IN THE AMERICAN WEST. I COME FROM NATIVE AMERICANS AND
MEXICAN DESCENDENTS, FRENCH TRAPPERS AND SPANISH PIONEERS. I COME FROM RANCHERS WHO CONTINUE TO HARVEST THE LAND AND
LABORERS LIKE MY GRANDFATHER ERNEST, WHO WORKED IN A STEEL MILL FOR 33 YEARS TO PROVIDE FOR
HIS FAMILY. AND I COME FROM STRONG WOMEN
LIKE MY GRANDMOTHER EVA, WHO HAD
TO LEAVE SCHOOL AFTER THE THIRD GRADE TO CARE FOR HER YOUNGER
SIBLINGS. GROWING UP, MY FAMILY WASN'T
RICH. IN FACT, MY PARENTS RELIED ON
FOOD STAMPS FOR A TIME TO GET
BY. BUT IN AMERICA, WE DON'T DEFINE
OUR VALUES BY OUR NET WORTH. MY FAMILIES GAVE ME THE NAME STANDSE, BELIEVING THAT IN AN INCLUSIVE AMERICA, IT WOULD NOT
BE A WALL TO MY SUCCESS. THEY ENCOURAGED ME TO WORK HARD AND GET AN EDUCATION, BELIEVING THAT IN A FAIR AMERICA, IT WOULD
CARRY ME ANYWHERE I WANTED TO
GO. AND YOU KNOW WHAT? THEY WERE RIGHT. ONLY IN AMERICA COULD A SHY LITTLE GIRL FROM NORTHLAND, COLORADO GROW UP TO BREAK GLASS CEILINGS AND SERVE AS THE
MAJORITY LEADER OUT OF COLORADO'S HOUSE OF
REPRESENTATIVES.</span><span class='hidden-full-transcript-ellipses'>...</span></p><a href='#' class='hidden-full-transcript-link'><i class='icon-chevron-down'></i> <span class='link-show-full-text'>Show Full Text</span><i class='icon-chevron-up'></i> <span class='link-show-less-text'>Show Less Text</span></a>

GIRL OR BOY OUT THERE LISTENING, I WANT TO SAY, NO MATTER WHO YOU ARE, NO MATTER WHERE YOU ARE FROM OR HOW YOU<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> GOT HERE, YOU ARE SPECIAL, AND YOUR POTENTIAL
IS AS BIG AS AMERICA ITSELF. THAT'S WHAT HILLARY CLINTON
BELIEVES. IT'S WHY SHE HAS SPENT A
LIFETIME FIGHTING FOR EVERY CHILD, FOR A STRONG SOCIAL SAFETY NET SO NO ONE FALLS
THROUGH THE CRACKS. FOR WORLD-CLASS PUBLIC SCHOOLS,
SO EDUCATION CAN BE A GREAT EQUALIZER. FOR A GOVERNMENT THAT RESPECTS AND PROTECT THE RIGHTS OF OF PEOPLE. SO WHAT WE LOOK LIKE AND WHO WE
LOVE HAS NO BEARING ON OUR OPPORTUNITIES. WE ARE A COUNTRY WHERE ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE WHEN EVERYONE IS
INCLUDED. AND I AM PROOF OF THAT.
I AM PROUD TO FIGHT FOR A PRESIDENT WHO NOT ONLY SHARES THOSE VALUES, SHE LIVES THEM.</span><span class='hidden-full-transcript-ellipses'>...</span></p><a href='#' class='hidden-full-transcript-link'><i class='icon-chevron-down'></i> <span class='link-show-full-text'>Show Full Text</span><i class='icon-chevron-up'></i> <span class='link-show-less-text'>Show Less Text</span></a>
