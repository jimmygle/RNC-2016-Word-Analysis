<strong>Anthony Campolo</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> PRAY WITH ME. PRAY WITH ME. DEAR GOD, WE ARE A NATION THAT
NEEDS HEALING. BREAK DOWN THE BARRIERS OF RACE AND THAT THAT SEPARATES US.
CURE THE SEXISM<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> AND HOMOPHOBIA THAT DENY THE DIGNITY OF SO MANY
OF OUR FELLOW AMERICANS. SHOW US HOW TO LOVE THE NEEDY IN
THE MIDST AND ALSO TO LOVE OUR ENEMIES.
HELP US TO OVERCOME EVIL WITH
GOOD. IN VIEW OUR RELIGIOUS LEADERS
WITH YOUR LOVE SO THAT THEY WILL
TEACH US HOW TO TRANSCEND THE
DIFFERENCES AND BECOME ONE
PEOPLE. TEACHES HOW TO BE -- BEAT OUR
SWORDS INTO PLOWSHARES AND LEARN
MORE NO MORE. WE PRAY THAT THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF OUR COUNTRY WILL SENSE THE OBLIGATION TO REACH OUT WITH
ADVANCED RESOURCES TO MINISTER
TO THOSE WHOM YOU CALLED "THE
LEAST OF EACH." NOT JUST IN AMERICA, BUT TO
PEOPLE IN NEED AROUND THE WORLD. MAY ALL OF OUR POLITICAL LEADERS BE COMMITTED TO MAKING AMERICA INTO A PEOPLE THAT STRIVE TO FEED THE HUNGRY, CLOTHE THE NAKED, PROVIDE CARE FOR ALL OF THE SICK, SPEAK JUSTICE ON
BEHALF OF THE OPPRESSED, AND
MAKE ROOM FOR REFUGEES. REMEMBERING YOUR ON SUN WAS ONCE A REFUGEE IN THE LAND OF EGYPT. IN THIS MEMORABLE NIGHT, WE PRAY
FOR HILLARY CLINTON. MAY HER CANDIDACY SEND A MESSAGE TO WOMEN EVERYWHERE THAT THE
GLASS CEILING THAT HAS HELD SO
MANY OF THEM DOWN IS BEING
BROKEN AND A NEW DAY IS DAWNING.
NOT ONLY FOR WOMEN, BUT FOR ALL
PEOPLE EVERYWHERE, WE ASK ALL THESE THINGS IN YOUR HOLY NAME. AMEN.</span><span class='hidden-full-transcript-ellipses'>...</span></p><a href='#' class='hidden-full-transcript-link'><i class='icon-chevron-down'></i> <span class='link-show-full-text'>Show Full Text</span><i class='icon-chevron-up'></i> <span class='link-show-less-text'>Show Less Text</span></a>
