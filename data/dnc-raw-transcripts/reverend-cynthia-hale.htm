<strong>Cynthia L. Hale</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> REV. HALE: PRAY WITH ME. AWESOME AND WONDERFUL GOD OF THE
UNIVERSE, YOU ARE THE ONE WHO CREATED THE WORLD AND ALL WHO
LIVE IN IT. YOU ARE THE GOD OF A<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> NATION,
EACH ONE OLD IN EXISTENCE TO
YOU. YOU MADE AMERICA THE GREAT
NATION IT IS, FILLED WITH GIFTED
AND ENTERPRISING PEOPLE.
WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO CREATE LEADERSHIP FOR THE WORLD AND ALL
OTHER NATIONS, WHILE AT THE SAME TIME OPERATING AS ONE NATION
UNDER YOUR NAME, WITH LIBERTY
AND JUSTICE FOR ALL. THROUGH OUR OWN HUMAN ERROR, WE
HAVE FALLEN SHORT OF YOUR EXPECTATIONS INSTEAD OF
OPERATING AS UNITED STATES AND A UNITED PEOPLE, WE HAVE BECOME
DIVIDED. WE HAVE ALLOWED OUR DIVERSITY TO
CAUSE US TO DEVALUE AND DS ISTRUST, AND MISTREAT ONE
ANOTHER. WE HAVE MADE PEOPLE THINK WE ARE
SUPERIOR TO OTHERS, PARTICULARLY
THE LEAST AMONG US.
THERE IS TENSION AND DISSENSION
IN THE LAND.
THIS IS NOT FOR US AND WE KNOW
IT. AS WE GATHER IN PHILADELPHIA THIS WEEK AT THE DEMOCRATIC
NATIONAL CONVENTION, WE UNDERSTAND ALL YOU HAVE ENTRUSTED TO US AND EXPECT OF
US. WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO YOU TO BE A PARTY THAT CELEBRATES DIVERSITY, VALUES ALL PEOPLE AND TREATS EVERYONE WITH DIGNITY AND RESPECT.
[APPLAUSE] WE HAVE A PLATFORM THAT SEEKS
TO ADDRESS THE ILLS OF OUR
NATION RIGHT NOW AND HELP US BE A JUST AND EQUITABLE SOCIETY.
WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY, OH GOD,
TO GIVE UNDENIABLE EVIDENCE OF
OUR COMMITMENT TO JUSTICE AND
EQUALITY. BY NOMINATING HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON AS OUR CANDIDATE --
[CHEERS] HALLELUJAH.
[APPLAUSE] AS OUR CANDIDATE FOR THE HIGHEST
OFFICE IN THE LAND. GOD, YOU HAVE GIVEN US WISDOM. NOW GIVE US COURAGE FOR THE FACING OF THIS HOUR.
[CHEERING]
[CROWD CHANTING] UNITE US, OH GOD, IN ONE PARTY. IT IS IN YOUR MIGHTY NAME THAT WE PRAY.
AMEN.</span><span class='hidden-full-transcript-ellipses'>...</span></p><a href='#' class='hidden-full-transcript-link'><i class='icon-chevron-down'></i> <span class='link-show-full-text'>Show Full Text</span><i class='icon-chevron-up'></i> <span class='link-show-less-text'>Show Less Text</span></a>
