<strong>Linda T. Sanchez</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> WE ARE HERE AT THIS HISTORIC CONVENTION TO NOMINATE HILLARY CLINTON AND TIM KAINE. I WANT TO SHARE A LITTLE BIT OF MY STORY BECAUSE IT IS AN AMERICAN<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> STORY. IT IS THE STORY OF MILLIONS OF
LATINOS AND LATINAS ACROSS THIS COUNTRY. I'M THE DAUGHTER OF IMMIGRANT PARENTS FROM MEXICO. THEY CAME TO THIS COUNTRY AND WORKED HARD EVERY DAY TO PROVIDE FOR ME AND MY BROTHERS AND SISTERS. MY FATHER WAS AN INDUSTRIAL MECHANIC AND MY MOTHER BECAME AN
ELEMENTARY SCHOOL TEACHER AFTER
RAISING A FAMILY. THEY OWN THEIR OWN HOME, THEY
SENT ALL SEVEN OF THEIR CHILDREN TO COLLEGE. MY MOTHER AND FATHER SAVED AND SACRIFICED TO ACHIEVE THE AMERICAN DREAM FOR OUR FAMILY.
THEY WERE NOT GIVEN THEIR
SUCCESS. THEY EARNED IT. DONALD TRUMP BELIEVES MEXICAN IMMIGRANTS ARE MURDERERS AND RATEPISTS. WHAT ABOUT MY PARENTS, DONALD? LET ME TELL YOU WHAT MY PARENTS
ARE. THEY ARE THE ONLY PARENTS AND
OUR NATION'S 265 YEAR HISTORY TO
SEND TWO DAUGHTERS TO THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS. BOTH MY -- LIKE MY PARENTS,
HILLARY CLINTON BELIEVES THE
UNITED STATES IS A COUNTRY WHERE ALL BACKGROUNDS CAN MAKE A BETTER LIFE.
THAT AMERICA IS NOT POSSIBLE IF
WE ALLOW DONALD TRUMP TO BUILD A
WALL THAT DIVIDES US.
I STAND HERE TONIGHT AS THE
CHAIR OF THE CONGRESSIONAL HISPANIC CAUCUS AND A PROUD CONGRESSWOMAN FROM CALIFORNIA,
BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY, I'M HERE
AS A MOM. WE ALL WANT WHAT IS BEST FOR OUR KIDS. WE WANT OUR CHILDREN TO GROW UP
TO BE HEALTHY, SUCCESSFUL, AND
KINDHEARTED. OUR JOB IS TO NURTURE THEM AND
TO BE GOOD ROLE MODELS FOR THEM
TO FOLLOW AS THEY GROW. I WILL BE THE FIRST TO TELL YOU
THAT BEING A PARENT IS HARD. DONALD TRUMP IS MAKING IT A
WHOLE LOT HARDER. HE HAS TAKEN THE LOW ROAD TIME
AND TIME AGAIN. HE HAS BEEN VULGAR AND INTOLERANT. KEEP THOSE FEAR AND INSECURITY
-- HE PEDDLES FEAR.
WHAT KIND OF EXAMPLE WOULD BE SET FOR OUR CHILDREN TO ALLOW A BULLY TO SIT IN THE OVAL
OFFICE? OUR CHILDREN ARE NOT BORN WITH RACISM AND HATE IN THEIR HEARTS. THEY LEARNED FROM FOLLOWING THE ADULTS IN THEIR LIVES. TOO MANY OF OUR CHILDREN ARE
LEARNING THE WRONG LESSONS FROM
DONALD TRUMP.
WE SAW IT IN INDIANA BASKETBALL GAME WHERE WHITE STUDENTS STARTED CHANTING, BUILD THAT WALL." THIS IS THE BEHAVIOR THAT DONALD TRUMP INSPIRES AND ARGUE.
-- INSPIRES IN OUR YOUTH. IT WOULD BE A SIMPLE TO OUR CHILDREN THAT WE CONDONE THIS TYPE OF BEHAVIOR.
THAT IS A MESSAGE I REFUSE TO
ACCEPT. THERE ARE FEW MOMENTS IN HISTORY
THAT HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE
TRAJECTORY OF THE WORLD. I BELIEVE THIS ELECTION IS ONE
OF THOSE MOMENTS. OUR CHILDREN ARE WATCHING US.
THEIR FUTURE DEPENDS ON THE
OUTCOME OF THIS RACE. DO WE WANT A RESPONSIBLE LEADER
OR A LOUDMOUTH BULLY? DO WE WANT A PRESIDENT WHO
RESPECTS WOMEN OR WHO CALLS THEM
NAMES AND YOU VALUES THEM?
-- AND DEVALUES THEM? DO WE WANT SOMEONE WHO VILIFIES IMMIGRANTS? HILLARY CLINTON IS THE ONLY CHOICE FOR PRESIDENT.
SHE IS A PRESIDENT WE CAN BE
PROUD OF. AND DONALD, LET ME SAY THIS. AMERICA IS GREAT.
IT IS THE COUNTRY THAT GAVE MY
FAMILY THE OPPORTUNITY FOR A
BETTER LIFE, JUST LIKE ALL IMMIGRANTS WHO CAME BEFORE THEM. IT IS BECAUSE OF OUR DIVERSITY
THAT WE ARE THE ENEMY OF THE WORLD.
-- THAT WE ARE THE ENVY OF THE WORLD. LIKE I SAID IN THE VIDEO, HILLARY CLINTON IS A BADASS AND
READY TO LEAD. LET'S WIN IN  NOVEMBER.</span><span class='hidden-full-transcript-ellipses'>...</span></p><a href='#' class='hidden-full-transcript-link'><i class='icon-chevron-down'></i> <span class='link-show-full-text'>Show Full Text</span><i class='icon-chevron-up'></i> <span class='link-show-less-text'>Show Less Text</span></a>
