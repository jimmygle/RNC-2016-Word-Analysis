<strong>Anton Moore</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> MY NAME IS ANTON, PRESIDENT
OF UNITY IN THE COMMUNITY. IN 1972, HILLARY TRAVEL TO ALABAMA ON A MISSION. SHE WAS THERE TO HELP SHED LIGHT ON SEGREGATED<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> ACADEMIES, PRIVATE SCHOOLS THAT POPPED UP ACROSS THE STATE AFTER THE SUPREME COURT ORDERED PUBLIC SCHOOLS TO INTEGRATE. WHEN THESE SCHOOLS APPLY FOR FEDERAL STATE EXEMPTIONS, THEY CLAIMED THEY WEREN'T TRYING TO PROMOTE SEGREGATION BUT HILLARY HELPED PROVE THEY WERE. HILLARY VISITED ONE OF THESE
ACADEMIES POSING AS A MOTHER LOOKING FOR A ROLE FOR HER CHILD AND YET -- AND THE ADMINISTRATORS ASSURED THEY
WEREN'T ACCEPTING BLACK CHILDREN. HILLARY SHARED HER FOUNDLINGS WHAT THE DEFENSE FUND.
I WORK HARD AND THINK ABOUT THE
FAMILIES IN MY COMMUNITY. IN SOCIETY TODAY, WE MUST STAND
UP, PROMOTE NONVIOLENCE, AND
THAT IS WHY I'M WITH HILLARY

<strong>Dynah Haubert</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> AFTER HILLARY GRADUATED FROM
LAW SCHOOL, SHE COULD HAVE
GOTTEN A JOB ANYWHERE BUT SHE
CHOSE TO WORK FULL-TIME FOR THE CHILDREN'S DEFENSE FUND. SHE<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> WENT DOOR-TO-DOOR GATHERING
STORIES FROM DISABLED CHILDREN WHO DESPERATELY WANTED TO GO TO SCHOOL BUT WERE PREVENTED FROM
ENROLLING BY DISCRIMINATION.
HER RESEARCH CONTRIBUTED TO THE PASSAGE OF THE HISTORIC LEGISLATION THAT REQUIRED STATES
TO WRITE QUALITY EDUCATION FOR
DISABLED STUDENTS. AS A DISABLED PERSON, I BECAME A
LAWYER TO ADVOCATE THAT VISIBILITY -- DISABILITY IS NOT
A PROBLEM TO BE CURED BUT A PART
OF OUR IDENTITY AND DIVERSITY.
[APPLAUSE] AND THAT IS WHY TODAY ON THE
26TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT,
I'M WITH HER.
