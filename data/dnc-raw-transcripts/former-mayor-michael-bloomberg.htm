<strong>Kasim Reed</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> HELLO, GOVERNOR!
[CHEERS] GOOD EVENING.
[CHEERS] AS THE MAYOR OF ATLANTA, THE
CITY THAT BURNED TO THE GROUND
AND ROSE AGAIN FROM THE ASHES,
THE BIRTHPLACE<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> OF DR. MARTIN
LUTHER KING JR. AND THE HOME OF
THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT, AND BECAUSE WE WERE A CITY TOO BUSY
TO HATE, WE ARE NOW AT THE ECONOMIC CENTER OF THE SOUTHEAST. I'M HERE TODAY BECAUSE I BELIEVE
IN OUR FUTURE, I BELIEVE WE HAVE
A RESPONSIBILITY TO ONE ANOTHER, AND TO THE NEXT GENERATION TO
ENSURE THAT OUR OPPORTUNITIES ARE LIMITED ONLY BY OUR IMAGINATION. I SHARE THIS BELIEF WITH HILLARY
CLINTON. THAT OUR ACHIEVEMENTS ARE ONLY
LIMITED BY WHAT WE CAN DREAM AND DO. YOU SEE, ATLANTA IS A CITY OF DREAMERS. BUT WHEN I BECAME MAYOR OF THE
CITY, THE CITY WAS STRUGGLING.
THE WORST RECESSION IN 80 YEARS.
WE WERE DOWN, CRIME WITHOUT, BUT
I LOOKED -- CRIME WAS UP, I
LOOKED AROUND OUR CITY AND I SAW
THE WAY FORWARD WAS TO LEAN ON ONE ANOTHER, TO TURN TO ONE ANOTHER AND TO MAKE AN
UNSHAKABLE AGREEMENT THAT IF A YOUNG PERSON WAS WILLING TO
LEARN, WE WOULD PUT A BOOK IN HER HANDS.
IF A YOUNG MAN WAS WILLING TO WORK, WE WOULD PUT A JOB IN A
PAYCHECK IN HIS HANDS. AND IF YOU ARE WILLING TO STEP UP AND WE WILL MEET YOU HALFWAY
AND TOGETHER WE CAN PUT YOUR
FUTURE BACK IN YOUR HANDS.
PEOPLE WANT TO DREAM AGAIN.
[CHEERS] WE TURNED OUR CITY AROUND.
AT THE SAME TIME, PRESIDENT
BARACK OBAMA AND VICE PRESIDENT
JOE BIDEN WERE TURNING AMERICA
AROUND. TODAY, WE ARE STRONGER, AND WE
WILL GROW STRONGER STILL, WHEN
PRESIDENT HILLARY CLINTON BUILDS AN ECONOMY THAT WORKS FOR EVERYONE.
[APPLAUSE] MAYOR REED: MY FELLOW DEMOCRATS,
TONIGHT, WE CHOOSE DIVERSITY
OVER DIVISION.
WE CHOOSE A STEADY HANDED
COMMANDER IN CHIEF OVER A LOOSE
CANNON. WE CHOOSE A LEADER WHO WOULD
RATHER BE IN THE TRENCHES,
SECURING HEALTH CARE FOR 8 MILLION CHILDREN, THEN IN A
SWEET PUTTING HIS NAME ON A
TOWER THAT HE PROBABLY DOESN'T
OWN. WE CHOOSE SOMETHING DIFFERENT
TONIGHT.
[APPLAUSE] MAYOR REED: I BELIEVE AMERICANS
ARE READY TO GET TO WORK.
TO MAKE THE POSSIBLE, REAL. HILLARY CLINTON IS THE LEADER TO
TAKE US THERE. PRESIDENT HARRY TRUMAN ONCE SAID, "THERE ARE A SMALL NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN AMERICA WHO HAVE THE POWER, AND THE PRESTIGE, AND
THE CONNECTIONS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEIR INTERESTS ARE LOOKED AFTER." BUT HE SAID, "FOR
EVERYBODY ELSE, THERE IS THE
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES."
AND THAT IS WHY WE NEED HILLARY
CLINTON.
[APPLAUSE] MAYOR REED: MORE THAN 60 YEARS LATER, HIS STATEMENT HOLDS TRUE
TONIGHT. AND TONIGHT, WE HAVE SOMEONE WHO
WILL LOOK OUT FOR ALL AMERICANS,
AND WHO WILL DO SO EVERY DAY OF HER PRESIDENCY, WITH ALL OF HER
HEART.
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WE HAVE
OUR CHAMPION, HILLARY CLINTON.
LET ME HEAR YOU.
[APPLAUSE] MAYOR REED: AND NOW, I AM HONORED TO INTRODUCE SOMEONE WHO HAS BEEN A FRIEND AND MENTOR TO
ME DURING MY TIME AS MAYOR. MICHAEL BLOOMBERG HAS ARTICULATED AND OPTIMISTIC PERFORMANCE, A UNIVERSAL VISION THAT HAS BUILT NEW YORK CITY AND HAS ALSO HELPED OTHER CITIES
AROUND THE WORLD.
THANKS TO HIS PERFECT -- HIS PHILANTHROPY, HE HAS DONE SO MUCH.
PLEASE JOIN ME IN WELCOMING A MAN WHOSE COMMITMENT TO AMERICA TRANSCENDS POLITICS. THE THREE-TIME MAYOR OF THE CITY
OF NEW YORK, MICHAEL BLOOMBERG.
[APPLAUSE]

<strong>Michael R. Bloomberg</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> MR. BLOOMBERG: THANK YOU.
THANK YOU. KASIM, THANK YOU FOR THE KIND
INTRODUCTION. AND LET ME HANG ALL OF YOU FOR WELCOMING AN OUTSIDER HERE, TO DELIVER<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> -- 
[APPLAUSE] MR. BLOOMBERG: AN OUTSIDER, TO
DELIVER WHAT WILL BE AN
UNCONVENTIONAL CONVENTION
SPEECH. NOW, I AM NOT HERE AS A MEMBER
OF ANY PARTY. OR TO ENDORSE ANY PARTY
PLATFORM.
I AM HERE FOR ONE REASON. TO EXPLAIN WHY I BELIEVE IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT WE ELECT HILLARY CLINTON AS THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF
THE UNITED STATES.
[APPLAUSE] MR. BLOOMBERG: AND TO ASK YOU TO JOIN WITH ME IN SUPPORTING HER
THIS NOVEMBER. YOU KNOW, WHEN THE FOUNDING
FATHERS ARRIVED HERE IN
PHILADELPHIA TO FORGE A NEW NATION, THEY DIDN'T COME AS DEMOCRATS OR REPUBLICANS, OR TO
NOMINATE A PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE.
THEY CAME AS PATRIOTS WHO FEARED PARTY POLITICS, AND I KNOW HOW
THEY FELT. I HAVE BEEN A DEMOCRAT, I HAVE
BEEN A REPUBLICAN, AND I HAVE BEEN -- I EVENTUALLY BECAME AN INDEPENDENT, BECAUSE I DON'T BELIEVE THAT EITHER PARTY HAS A MONOPOLY ON GOOD IDEAS OR STRONG LEADERSHIP.
[APPLAUSE] MR. BLOOMBERG: WHEN I ENTER THE
VOTING BOOTH EACH TIME, I LOOK
AT THE CANDIDATES, NOT THE PARTY LABEL. I HAVE SUPPORTED ELECTORATE --
ELECTED OFFICIALS FROM BOTH SIDE
OF THE AISLE, AND PROBABLY, NOT MANY PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM CAN SAY THAT.
BUT I KNOW THERE ARE MANY
WATCHING AT HOME WHO CAN. AND NOW, THEY ARE CAREFULLY WEIGHING THEIR CHOICES.
I UNDERSTAND THEIR DILEMMA. I KNOW WHAT IT IS LIKE TO HAVE
NEITHER PARTY FULLY REPRESENT MY
VIEWS OR VALUES.
TOO MANY REPUBLICANS, BLAME IMMIGRANTS FOR THE PROBLEMS. THEY STAND IN THE WAY OF ACTION ON CLIMATE CHANGE AND GUN
VIOLENCE.
MEANWHILE, MANY DEMOCRATS, I
THINK WRONGLY, BLAME THE PRIVATE SECTOR FOR OUR PROBLEMS AND THEY STAND IN THE WAY OF ACTION ON EDUCATION AND DEFICIT REDUCTION.
THERE ARE TIMES WHEN I DISAGREE WITH HILLARY CLINTON. BUT LET ME TELL YOU, WHATEVER
OUR DISAGREEMENTS MAY BE, I HAVE
COME HERE TO SAY, WE MUST PUT THEM ASIDE FOR THE GOOD OF OUR COUNTRY.
[APPLAUSE] MR. BLOOMBERG: AND WE MUST UNITE AROUND THE CANDIDATE WHO CAN
DEFEAT A DANGEROUS DEMAGOGUE.
[APPLAUSE] MR. BLOOMBERG: I BELIEVE IT IS
THE DUTY OF ALL AMERICAN
CITIZENS TO MAKE OUR VOICES
HEARD BY VOTING IN THIS
ELECTION. AND IF YOU ARE NOT YET
REGISTERED TO VOTE, GO ONLINE
AND DO IT NOW. THIS IS TOO IMPORTANT TO SIT
OUT.
[APPLAUSE] MR. BLOOMBERG: NOW, WE HAVE HEARD A LOT OF TALK IN THIS CAMPAIGN ABOUT NEEDING A LEADER WHO UNDERSTANDS BUSINESS.
I COULDN'T AGREE MORE. I BUILT A BUSINESS, AND I DIDN'T
START IT WITH A MILLION-DOLLAR
CHECK FROM MY FATHER.
[APPLAUSE] MR. BLOOMBERG: BECAUSE OF MY
SUCCESS IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR, I
HAD THE CHANCE TO RUN AMERICA'S LARGEST CITY OR 12 YEARS,
GOVERNING IN THE WAKE OF ITS
GREATEST TRAGEDY.
TODAY, AS AN INDEPENDENT AND AN ENTREPRENEUR AND A FORMER MAYOR,
I BELIEVE WE HAVE IT -- NEED A
PRESIDENT WHO IS A PROBLEM
SOLVER, NOT A BOMB THROWER.
[APPLAUSE] MR. BLOOMBERG: SOMEONE WHO CAN
BRING MEMBERS OF CONGRESS
TOGETHER TO GET BIG THINGS DONE,
AND I KNOW HILLARY CAN DO THAT,
BECAUSE I SAW IT FIRST HAND. I WAS ELECTED MAYOR TWO MONTHS AFTER 9/11, AS A REPUBLICAN.
AND I SAW HOW HILLARY WORKED
WITH REPUBLICANS IN WASHINGTON TO ENSURE NEW YORK GOT THE HELP THEY NEEDED TO RECOVER AND REBUILD.
THROUGHOUT HER TIME IN THE
SENATE, YES, THROUGHOUT HER TIME
IN THE SENATE, WE DIDN'T ALWAYS AGREE, BUT HILLARY CLINTON
ALWAYS LISTENED. AND THAT IS THE KIND OF APPROACH WE NEED IN WASHINGTON TODAY, AND
IT JUST HAS TO START IN THE
WHITE HOUSE.
[APPLAUSE] MR. BLOOMBERG: GIVEN MY BACKGROUND, I WILL OFTEN
ENCOURAGE BUSINESS LEADERS TO
RUN FOR OFFICE, BECAUSE MANY OF
THEM SHARE THE SAME PRAGMATIC APPROACH TO BUILDING CONSENSUS. BUT NOT ALL.
MOST OF US WHO HAVE CREATED A
BUSINESS KNOW THERE -- WE ARE ONLY AS GOOD AS HOW OUR EMPLOYEES, CLIENTS, AND
CUSTOMERS VIEW WAS. MOST OF US DON'T PRETEND WE ARE
SMART ENOUGH TO MAKE EVERY
DECISION BY OURSELVES, AND MOST
OF US WHO HAVE OUR NAMES ON THE
DOOR KNOW WE ARE ONLY AS GOOD AS
OUR WORD. BUT NOT DONALD TRUMP.
[APPLAUSE] MR. BLOOMBERG: THROUGH HIS CAREER, THE DONALD TRUMP HAS
LEFT BEHIND HAS LEFT BEHIND A WELL-DOCUMENTED OR -- RECORD OF
BANKRUPTCIES, LAWSUITS, ANGRY
STOCKHOLDERS, AND CONGRESS MERGERS -- CONTRACTORS WHO FEEL
THEY HAVE BEEN TRICKED -- THEY
HAVE BEEN CHEATED.
TRUMP WANTS TO RUN THE NATION LIKE HE RUNS HIS BUSINESS?
GOD HELP US.
[APPLAUSE] MR. BLOOMBERG: I AM A NEW YORKER, AND I KNOW A CON WHEN I
SEE ONE.
[APPLAUSE] MR. BLOOMBERG: TRUMP SAYS HE WILL PUNISH MANUFACTURERS THAT
MOVED TO MEXICO OR CHINA.
BUT THE CLOTHES HE CELLS ARE
MADE OVERSEAS AT LOW-WAGE FACTORIES. HE SAYS HE WANTS TO PUT
AMERICANS BACK TO WORK, BUT HE GAINS -- GAINS -- GAMES THE VISA
SYSTEM SO HE CAN HIRE LOW-WAGE
WORKERS.
HE SAYS HE WANTED A PORT -- WANTS TO DEPORT UNDOCUMENTED PEOPLE, BUT HE SEEMS TO HAVE NO
PROBLEM HIRING THEM.
WHAT DID I MISS HERE? TRUTH BE TOLD, THE RICHEST THING
ABOUT DONALD TRUMP IS HIS
HYPOCRISY.
[APPLAUSE] MR. BLOOMBERG: HE WANTS YOU TO
BELIEVE THAT WE CAN SOLVE OUR
BIGGEST PROBLEMS BY DEPORTING
MEXICANS AND SHUTTING OUT
MUSLIMS. HE WANTS YOU TO BELIEVE THAT
ERECTING TRADE BARRIERS WILL
BRING BACK GOOD JOBS. HE IS WRONG ON BOTH COUNTS. WE CAN ONLY SOLVE OUR BIGGEST PROBLEMS IF WE COME TOGETHER AND EMBRACE THE FREEDOMS THAT OUR
FOUNDING FATHERS ESTABLISHED
RIGHT HERE IN PHILADELPHIA. WHICH PERMITTED OUR ANCESTORS TO
CREATE THE GREAT AMERICAN EXCEPTIONALISM THAT ALL OF US
NOW ENJOY. DONALD TRUMP DOESN'T UNDERSTAND THAT.
HILLARY CLINTON DOES.
[APPLAUSE] MR. BLOOMBERG: AND WE CAN ONLY
CREATE GOOD JOBS IF WE MAKE SMARTER INVESTMENTS IN
INFRASTRUCTURE, AND DO MORE TO
SUPPORT SMALL BUSINESSES, NOT
STIFF THEM.
DONALD TRUMP DOESN'T UNDERSTAND
THAT. HILLARY CLINTON DOES.
[APPLAUSE] MR. BLOOMBERG: I UNDERSTAND THE
APPEAL OF A BUSINESSMAN PRESIDENT. BUT TRUMPS BUSINESS PLAN IS A
DISASTER IN THE MAKING. HE WOULD MAKE IT HARDER FOR
SMALL BUSINESSES TO COMPETE, DO
GREAT DAMAGE TO THE ECONOMY, THREATEN THE RETIREMENT SAVINGS
OF MILLIONS OF AMERICANS, LEAD
TO GREATER DEBT AND MORE EMPLOYMENT, ERODE OUR INFLUENCE AROUND THE WORLD AND MAKE OUR COMMUNITIES LESS SAFE. THE BOTTOM LINE IS, DONALD TRUMP
IS A RISKY, RECKLESS AND RADICAL
CHOICE, AND WE CAN'T AFFORD TO
MAKE THAT CHOICE.
[APPLAUSE] MR. BLOOMBERG: NOW, I KNOW HILLARY CLINTON IS NOT FLAWLESS. NO CANDIDATE IS.
BUT SHE IS THE RIGHT CHOICE, AND
THE RESPONSIBLE CHOICE IN THIS ELECTION.
[APPLAUSE] MR. BLOOMBERG: AND NO MATTER WHAT YOU MAY THINK ABOUT HER
POLITICS OR HER RECORD, HILLARY CLINTON UNDERSTANDS THAT THIS IS
NOT REALITY TELEVISION. THIS IS REALITY.
[APPLAUSE] MR. BLOOMBERG: SHE UNDERSTANDS
THE JOB OF PRESIDENT.
IT INVOLVES FINDING SOLUTIONS, NOT POINTING FINGERS. OFFERING HOPE, NOT STOKING FEAR. OVER THE COURSE OF OUR COUNTRY'S PROUD HISTORY, WE HAVE FACED OUR
SHARE OF GRAVE CHALLENGES. BUT WE HAVE NEVER RETREATED IN
FEAR.
NEVER. NOT HERE IN PHILADELPHIA IN 1776, NOT AT GETTYSBURG IN 1863, NOT THROUGH TWO WORLD WARS AND
THE GREAT DEPRESSION, NOT AT SELMA OR STONE WALL, NOT AFTER
9/11.
WE MUST NOT START NOW.
[APPLAUSE] AMERICA, AMERICA IS THE GREATEST
COUNTRY ON EARTH. AND WHEN PEOPLE -- PEOPLE COME
HERE.
THE PRESIDENCY OF THE UNITED
STATES IS THE MOST POWERFUL OFFICE IN THE WORLD.
I SAY TO MY FELLOW INDEPENDENCE, YOUR VOTES MATTER NOW. YOUR VOTE WILL DETERMINE THE
FUTURE OF YOUR JOB, YOUR BUSINESS, AND OUR FUTURE TOGETHER AS A COUNTRY. TO ME, THIS ELECTION IS NOT A
CHOICE BETWEEN A DEMOCRAT AND A
REPUBLICAN. IT IS A CHOICE BETWEEN WHO IS
BETTER TO LEAD OUR COUNTRY RIGHT
NOW.
[APPLAUSE] MR. BLOOMBERG: BETTER FOR OUR ECONOMY, BETTER FOR OUR SECURITY, BETTER FOR OUR
FREEDOM, AND BETTER FOR OUR
FUTURE.
THERE IS NO DOUBT IN MY MIND THAT HILLARY CLINTON IS THE RIGHT CHOICE THIS NOVEMBER.
[APPLAUSE] MR. BLOOMBERG: SO TONIGHT, AS AN INDEPENDENT, I AM ASKING YOU TO JOIN WITH ME, NOT OUT OF PARTY
LOYALTY, BUT OUT OF LOVE OF
COUNTRY. AND TOGETHER, AND TOGETHER,
LET'S SELECT A SANE, CONFIDENT PERSON WITH INTERNATIONAL EXPERIENCE.
[APPLAUSE] MR. BLOOMBERG: A UNIFIER WHO IS
MATURE ENOUGH TO REACH OUT FOR ADVICE, TO BUILD CONSENSUS AND
TO RECOGNIZE THAT WE ALL HAVE
SOMETHING TO CONTRIBUTE. SO LET'S ELECT HILLARY CLINTON
AS THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE GREATEST COUNTRY IN THE WORLD, THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THANK YOU.
