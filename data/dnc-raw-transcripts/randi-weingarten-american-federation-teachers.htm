<strong>Randi Weingarten</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> BROTHERS AND SISTERS. I'M PROUD TO BE HERE REPRESENTING THE 1.6 MILLION MEMBERS OF THE OF THE AST.
-- AFT.LAST WEEK WE SAW A
FESTIVAL OF FEAR. EVERY<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> DAY WAS FULL OF HATE. WHY? TO HIDE THAT TRUMPS PLAN LIKE
MANY OF HIS BUSINESSES ARE COMPLETELY BANKRUPT. DONALD MADE MILLIONS WHILE HE
RIPPED OFF WORKERS AND SMALL BUSINESSES WITH HIS UNFAIR
BUSINESS PRACTICES. REMEMBER, HE ENDED UP BANKRUPTING NOT ONE, NOT TWO, NOT THREE, BUT FOR OF HIS COMPANIES -- BUT FOUR OF HIS COMPANIES.
AND HIS ECONOMIC IDEAS WILL MAKE MILLIONAIRES LIKE HIM RICHER AT THE EXPENSE OF THE MIDDLE CLASS. JUST LOOK AT TRUMP UNIVERSITY TO SEE HOW HE OPERATES. SALESPEOPLE WERE TOLD TO EXPLOIT PEOPLE'S FEARS. AND I QUOTE, A SINGLE PARENT
THAT MAY NEED MONEY FOR FOOD INTO USELESS HIGH COST SEMINARS. INSTEAD OF AN EDUCATION, STUDENTS LOST THOUSANDS OF
DOLLARS AND GOT NOTHING IN
RETURN. THAT IS TRUMP IN A NUTSHELL. MANIPULATING PEOPLE'S FEARS TO ENRICH HIMSELF. HE IS COMPLETELY UNQUALIFIED TO BE IN THE OVAL OFFICE.
[CHEERING] THANKFULLY, WE HAVE A DIFFERENT CHOICE AND IT IS A GREAT ONE.
HILLARY CLINTON.
[CHEERING] SHE HAS WORKED HER ENTIRE LIFE
TO LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD FOR
WORKING FAMILIES. THAT'S US OF PUBLIC EDUCATION FROM PRE-K TO COLLEGE. A PLAN FOR UNIVERSAL EARLY
CHILDHOOD EDUCATION. SHE WILL READ SET EDUCATION
POLICIES THAT FOCUS ON CREATING CREATIVITY AND CRITICAL THINKING, NOT TOO MUCH TESTING.
[CHEERING] AND SHE WILL MAKE PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES FREE FOR WORKING
FAMILIES. A STARK CONTRAST FROM DONALD TRUMP'S FOR PROFIT SCAM.
HELLER IS THE MOST QUALIFIED CANDIDATE -- HILLARY IS THE MOST QUALIFIED CANDIDATE TO RUN IN MY
LIFETIME. THE TOYS COULD NOT BE CLEAR. WE MUST ELECT HILLARY CLINTON
AND TIM KAINE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
