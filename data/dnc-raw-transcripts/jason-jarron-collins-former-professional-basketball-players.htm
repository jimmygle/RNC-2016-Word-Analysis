<strong>Jarron Collins</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> THANK YOU. I'M SURE COLLINS. ALONGSIDE MY KIND AND BRILLIANT WIFE ELSA. WE HAVE THREE CHILDREN THAT ARE
RAISED HERE IN AMERICA. I WANT MY KIDS TO KNOW<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> THAT
ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE HERE. I WANT THEM TO KNOW THAT ANY MORE THAN A STAR ATHLETE, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
IS A ROLE MODEL TO MILLIONS OF
CHILDREN.
WHEN IT COMES TO DONALD TRUMP, HOW DO YOU TELL YOUR KIDS NOT TO
BE A BULLY THAT THE PRESIDENT IS
ONE?
[CHEERING] HOW DO YOU TELL YOUR KIDS TO RESPECT THEIR HERITAGE IF THEIR
PRESIDENT DISPARAGES THEM. HOW DO YOU TELL YOUR DAUGHTER IF
THEY ARE EMPOWERED IF THEIR PRESIDENT REDUCES WOMEN TO THEIR
PHYSICAL OF.
? MY PARENTS, MY FAMILY, AND ALL THE GREAT COACHES I'VE HAD IN MY
LIFE HAVE TAUGHT ME THE
IMPORTANCE OF WORKING HARD,
PLAYING FAIR AND MOST IMPORTANT,
THE ABILITY TO LEAD AND BRING
PEOPLE TOGETHER TO COLLEGE GREAT THINGS -- ACCOMPLISH GREAT
THINGS. THAT SOUNDS LIKE HILLARY CLINTON TO ME.
[CHEERING] IT IS WITH GREAT PRIDE THAT INTRODUCED THE FIRST PUBLIC LIKE A ATHLETE TO PLAY IN ANY OF THE
FOUR MAJOR AMERICAN SPORTS, MY LESS HANDSOME TWIN
BROTHER, JASON COLLINS.

<strong>Jason Collins</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> THANK YOU.
I WILL GET YOU BACK FOR THAT ONE
LATER. MY DREAM WAS TO PLAY IN THE NBA AND LIVE MY AUTHENTIC LIFE AS A
PROUD GAY MAN AT THE SAME TIME.
[CHEERING]<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> I WAS ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH BOTH OF THOSE GOALS BECAUSE OF THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE SUPPORTED ME
THROUGHOUT MY LIFE.
BEFORE I CAME OUT, TO THE WORLD ON THE COVER OF SPORTS
ILLUSTRATE IT, I CANNOT PRIVATELY FOR THE CLINTON FAMILY.
I HAVE KNOWN THE FAMILY FOR
ALMOST 20 YEARS.
I KNEW THAT THEY WOULD ACCEPT ME
FOR WHO I WAS AND THAT THEY
WOULD HELP PAY THE PAST OR OTHERS TO DO THE SAME.
-- PAVE THE PATH FOR OTHERS TO DO THE SAME.
I'M GRATEFUL FOR THEIR WORDS OF
WISDOM AND THEIR UNCONDITIONAL SUPPORT. THEY KNEW THAT MY SEXUAL ORIENTATION MAY A DIFFERENCE IN MY ABILITY TO PLAY BASKETBALL.
[CHEERING] JUST AS SOMEONE'S GENDER MAKES
NO DIFFERENCE IN HIS OR HER
ABILITY TO MEET OUR NATION -- LEAD OUR NATION.
[CHEERING] HILLARY HAS DEFENDED THE LGBTQ
COMMUNITY FOR YEARS FROM COSPONSORING THE MATTHEW SHEPARD HATE CRIME PREVENTION ACT TO
HELPING PASS THE FIRST EVER U.N. RESOLUTION ON LGBTQ HUMAN RIGHTS AND TO MAKING SURE THAT TRANSGENDER INDIVIDUAL PASSPORTS COULD REFLECT A TRUE GENDER.
[CHEERING] AS BOTH AN AFRICAN-AMERICAN AND
A MEMBER OF THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY,
THE CHOICE FOR CONTINUED PROGRESS IS CLEAR. WE MUST ELECT HILLARY CLINTON AS
OUR NEXT PRESIDENT.
THANK YOU.
