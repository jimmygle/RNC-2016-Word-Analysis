<strong>Ruben Gallego</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> REP. GALLEGO: THANK YOU, THANK
YOU. THESE DAYS SOME PEOPLE, CONGRESSMAN. THE PROUDEST TITLE I'VE EVER HAD
IS THAT IT UNITED STATES MARINE. I SERVED IN<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> IRAQ, AND THE LEGENDARY LIMA COMPANY OUT OF OHIO. DEPLOY BEHIND -- BESIDES ME WERE
THE SONS OF NATIVE AMERICANS, AFRICAN AMERICANS, MIDWESTERN WHITE BOYS, AND MUSLIM AMERICANS
AS WELL.
[APPLAUSE] WHILE WE WERE LOOKING FOR INSURGENTS IN IRAQ WE DO NOT CARE ABOUT EACH OTHER'S RACE OR
RELIGION. WE FOUGHT TOGETHER. WE LAUGHED TOGETHER AND WE
MOURNED TOGETHER. PATRIOTISM, SERVICE, AND
SACRIFICE. KEEPING YOUR WORD. THOSE ARE THE VALUES OF UNITED
STATES MARINE CORPS.
THOSE OVER AMERICAN VALUES. THOSE ARE NOT DONALD TRUMP'S VALUES. DONALD TRUMP IS A MAN WHO QUESTIONS THE LOYALTY OF THOSE
WHO SERVE OUR COUNTRY WITHOUT EVER HIMSELF SERVING. THAT IS NOT PATRIOTIC. SERVICE AND SACRIFICE? DONALD TRUMP SAYS ABOUT SENATOR MCCAIN, "LOTS OF PEOPLE WERE NOT
CAPTURED." AS A MARINE, AS AN AMERICAN, I
AM OFFENDED. WHEN IT COMES TO HONORING THE
SERVICE OF OUR TROOPS, TRUMP HAS
INSPIRED THE MISS WORK BECAUSE
OF THEIR DUTY.
THAT IS NOT JUST ILLEGAL, IT IS IMMORAL. AND SET OF KEEPING HIS WORD TO VETERANS, HE HAS USED US AS AN
EXCUSE TO BACK OUT OF DEBATES
THEN FAILED FOR MONTHS TO DELIVER ON THE DONATION HE PROMISED TO VETERANS. ONE OF MY FELLOW MARINES CALLED TRUMP UNIVERSITY A COMPLETE CON. I SAY THAT ABOUT DONALD TRUMP
HIMSELF.
[CHEERS] DONALD TRUMP IS A SCAM ARTIST. HE IS TRYING TO PULL OFF THE ULTIMATE SCAM, PRETENDING HE
CARES ABOUT VETERANS. HILLARY CLINTON IS THE REAL
DEAL. SHE FOUGHT FOR THE POST-9/11 G.I. BILL AND THE SENATE TO SEND
OUR VETERANS A COLLEGE. SHE EXTENDED HEALTH INSURANCE TO AMERICA'S RESERVISTS, AND SHE
HAS A REAL PLAN TO COMBAT VETERANS HOMELESSNESS. MEANWHILE, WHEN TRUMP SAW
DISABLED VETERANS LEGALLY
SELLING MERCHANDISE IN FRONT OF
HIS PROPERTIES HE SAID THERE WORK WAS DOWNGRADING THE
AREA. LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING, DONALD, OUR VETERANS DON'T
DOWNGRADE YOUR REAL ESTATE. THEY UPGRADE OUR COUNTRY.
[CHEERS] DONALD PRAISES DICTATORS OF
INSULT OUR ALLIES. HIS FOREIGN POLICY BE BASED ON FALSE BRAVADO AND BLUSTER. I KNOW THE IMPORTANCE OF A
COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF WHO MAKES THOUGHTFUL DECISIONS WITH THE
MOST IMPORTANT WILL -- POWER THEY HAVE. TO SEND OUR MEN AND WOMEN INTO
BATTLE. WE NEED A PRESIDENT WHO HONORS THE SERVICE OF OUR TROOPS ABROAD AND HE RESPECTS THEIR SACRIFICE
WHEN THEY COME HOME. A LEADER WHO PROVIDES STEADY LEADERSHIP AND PROTECTS AMERICAN
VALUES. WE NEED HILLARY CLINTON AS THE
NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.
THANK YOU.
[CHEERS]

<strong>Unidentified Speaker</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> IF I HAD TO DESCRIBE PAT IN ONE WORD, IT WOULD BE LOVING. WE GREW UP AND GOT MARRIED AND
WE WERE 21.
HE WAS A FAMILY MAN. WHATEVER TIME HE WAS ABLE<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> TO
SPEND WITH US, HE WAS THERE.
WHATEVER HE CAN DO TO HELP THEM PROTECT, THAT IS WHAT HE
WANTED TO DO. IT'S ONE OF THE REASONS I FELL
IN LOVE WITH HIM.
HE REALIZED HE COULD DO THAT AND FLY IF HE JOINED THE ARMY. HE TOOK THE JOB VERY SERIOUSLY. ANY TIME HE WAS HOME HE ANSWERED
TO THAT LITTLE GIRL.
WE WERE HIS WORLD. PATRICK WAS IN IRAQ IN TWO DOZEN FOR.
HIS UNIT WAS CALLED OUT TO DO A
SEARCH AND RESCUE. PATRICK CRASHED TRYING TO SAVE
THE LIVES OF OTHERS. THAT WAS THE KIND OF PERSON HE WAS. I WAS NUMB. I LOST MY HUSBAND, MY BEST FRIEND, AND MY DAUGHTER LOST HER DAD. LOSING PAT SHOOK OUR FOUNDATION. IT WAS LIKE, OK, WHAT DO WE DO NEXT? HILLARY CLINTON RELEASED SOME OF
THE FINANCIAL STRESS. Y -- IT ALLOWED ME TO FOCUS ON ME AND MY DAUGHTER, TO HEAL,
TO GIVE HER A STABLE HOME. WHAT HILLARY HAS DONE FOR OUR FAMILY AND OTHER MILITARY FAMILIES, WORDS CAN'T EVEN DESCRIBE IT. SHE UNDERSTANDS WHAT OUR COUNTRY
NEEDS. 12 YEARS AGO SHE UNDERSTOOD WHAT
OUR FAMILY NEEDED. SHE HAVE THE GUMPTION TO GET
THINGS DONE. THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT YOU WANT
AND OUR PRESIDENT.
-- IN OUR PRESIDENT.
