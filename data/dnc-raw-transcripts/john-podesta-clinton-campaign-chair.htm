<strong>John D. Podesta</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> HELLO, DEMOCRATS. I WANT TO BEGIN BY SAYING THANK YOU TO ALL OF YOU ACROSS THE COUNTRY WHO HAVE VOLUNTEERED YOUR TIME, DONATED WHAT YOU COULD, SIGNED<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> UP AT HILLARYCLINTON.COM. YOU HAVE VOTED TO MAKE HILLARY CLINTON THE NOMINEE OF THE
DEMOCRATIC PARTY AND THIS IS
YOUR VICTORY. TO EVERYONE WHO SUPPORTED SENATOR SANDERS, THIS IS YOUR
VICTORY, TOO. I HAVE KNOWN BERNIE SINCE I WAS
A YOUNG STAFFER AND HE WAS MAYOR OF BURLINGTON. HE STOOD UP TO THE SPECIAL INTEREST AND THOUGHT TO GIVE WORKING PEOPLE -- FOUGHT TO GIVE WORKING PEOPLE A FAIRER SAY. DONALD TRUMP HAS DIFFERENT
VALUES. HE BUILT HIS CAREER BY RIPPING PEOPLE OFF, SKIPPING OUT ON HIS BILLS THROUGH BANKRUPTCY. HE IS DANGEROUS AND DIVISIVE TO TRUST TO THE WHITE HOUSE.
I AM A FORTUNATE GRANDSON OF ITALIAN IMMIGRANTS WITH A BLUE-COLLAR DAD AND A COLLAR MOM
--PINK-CALL HER MOM.
-- PINK-COLLAR MOM. I AM WORKING TO ELECT A
PRESIDENT WHO HAS THE
EXPERIENCE, VISION TO MAKE PROGRESS IN THESE TURBULENT TIMES.
THAT PERSON IS HILLARY CLINTON. HILLARY WILL BE A PRESIDENT WHO
WILL TAKE ON POWERFUL SPECIAL-INTEREST TO MAKE OUR ECONOMY WORKS FOR EVERYONE.
SHE WILL BE A CHAMPION FOR OUR CHILDREN AND FAMILIES.
WITH YOUR HARD WORK, WE CAN
BUILD A BETTER FUTURE FOR EVERYONE. FARM FAMILIES AND MILITARY
FAMILIES, THE FORGOTTEN MIDDLE
CLASS, AND THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN
LEFT OUT AND LEFT BEHIND, AND IMMIGRANTS, PEOPLE LIKE MY FAMILY AND YOURS WHO STRUGGLED
TO GET HERE WHO BUILT THIS COUNTRY AND WHO LOVE AMERICA. THAT IS WHO WE ARE FIGHTING FOR
AND THAT IS TO THE SELECTION IS ABOUT AND THAT IS WHY SHEEP TIM KAINE AS A RUNNING MATE FOR --
THAT IS WHY SHEEP TIM KAINE AS
-- SHE PICKED TIM KAINE AS A
RUNNING MATE.

WOMAN PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. THANK YOU.
