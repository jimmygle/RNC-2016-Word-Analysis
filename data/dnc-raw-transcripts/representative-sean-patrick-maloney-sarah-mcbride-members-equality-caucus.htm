<strong>Unidentified Speaker</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> GOOD EVENING. MY NAME IS SEAN PATRICK MALONEY, THE FIRST OPENLY GAY PERSON EVER ELECTED TO CONGRESS IN THE GREAT STATE OF NEW YORK. YOU KNOW, LAST<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> WEEK, A SPEAKER
AT THE REPUBLICAN CONVENTION
CALLED A QUALITY A
"DISTRACTION." WHO CARES? HE ASKED. I CARE.
MY HUSBAND RANDY AND OUR THREE CHILDREN CARE. THE LGBT LEADERS STANDING WITH
ME AND THROUGHOUT THE HALL CARE. THE AUTHORS OF OUR NATION'S DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE
SIGNED RIGHT HERE IN PHILADELPHIA, THEY CARE. AMERICANS AT STONEWALL CARED. AND HILLARY CLINTON CARES AS
WELL. I WANT TO TELL YOU A STORY. IN JUNE, I WAS WALKING PAST THE
SUPREME COURT. A CROWD WAS GATHERED, WAITING FOR THE HISTORIC MARRIAGE DECISION. THE NEWS HIT LIKE A THUNDERCLOUD.
A LOT OF US WEPT. THEN, SPONTANEOUSLY, HUNDREDS
JOINED TOGETHER TO SING OUR
NATIONAL ANTHEM. I CALLED RANDY. I COULD BARELY SPEAK. YOU SEE, RANDY AND I HAVE BEEN
TOGETHER FOR 24 YEARS. LOVE YOU, HONEY. 23 OF THOSE YEARS, WE HAVE BEEN
RAISING CHILDREN. YES, OUR FAMILY IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT, BUT WE READ BEDTIME
STORIES THE SAME. WE TIE SHOES AND CHECK HOMEWORK THE SAME. WE DREAM AND WE COMFORT THE SAME.
BUT UNTIL THAT DAY, WE WERE NOT
THE SAME, NOT REALLY, NOT IN THE
EYES OF THE LAW.
AS I LYCIAN -- AS I LISTENED TO
OUR NATIONAL ANTHEM, I REALIZED OUR FAMILY, OUR LOVE, WAS NO
LONGER LESS AND.
WE WERE NOW EQUAL.
[APPLAUSE] YOU KNOW, IT'S A BEAUTIFUL SAYING WHEN YOUR COUNTRY CATCHES
UP TO YOU, AND WHEN YOUR BASIC RIGHTS AND YOUR VERY FAMILY ARE
ON THE LINE, IT MATTERS WHAT
HAPPENS IN THOSE YOUTHFUL
BUILDINGS WITH MARBLE COLUMNS. IT MATTERS WHO IS LEADING THE COUNTRY, AND IT MATTERS IF THEY
CARE.
AMERICA, WE HAVE A CHOICE. DONALD TRUMP DOES NOT CARE ABOUT FAMILIES. HE DOESN'T CARE ABOUT MARRIAGE
EQUALITY. HE WANTS TO GO BACKWARD. WHEN I FIRST MET HILLARY
CLINTON, I WAS NOBODY, A GAY KID SLEEPING ON A COUCH SCARED TO DEATH THAT WHO I WAS WAS NOT
GOING TO BE OK, AND THAT NO ONE
WOULD EVER CARE ABOUT ME. AND HERE WAS THIS WOMAN, THIS INCREDIBLE WOMAN, ABOUT TO
BECOME OUR FIRST LADY, AND SHE
CARED. AND OVER THE PAST 24 YEARS, SHE
HAS KEPT CARING ABOUT ME, ABOUT OUR HUSBAND -- ABOUT MY HUSBAND, ABOUT OUR KIDS, AND I HAVE SEEN THE WAY SHE CARES ABOUT OUR
FAMILY, THAT SHE CARES ABOUT
YOUR FAMILY, THAT SHE CARES ABOUT ALL FAMILIES.
AND THAT IS WHY WE MUST CARE
ABOUT THIS ELECTION. NOW, I WANT TO INTRODUCE SARAH
MCBRIDE.
[APPLAUSE] SARAH MCBRIDE IS A COURAGEOUS YOUNG READER, AND SHE IS NOW THE
FIRST TRANSGENDERED PERSON EVER TO ADDRESS A NATIONAL CONVENTION.
SARAH. IT'S ABOUT TIME. SARAH, IT IS AN HONOR TO MAKE HISTORY WITH YOU, BECAUSE WE ARE
STRONGER TOGETHER.</span><span class='hidden-full-transcript-ellipses'>...</span></p><a href='#' class='hidden-full-transcript-link'><i class='icon-chevron-down'></i> <span class='link-show-full-text'>Show Full Text</span><i class='icon-chevron-up'></i> <span class='link-show-less-text'>Show Less Text</span></a>

<strong>Unidentified Speaker</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> THANK YOU SO MUCH, CONGRESSMAN.
MY NAME IS SARAH MCBRIDE, AND I
AM A PROUD TRANSGENDERED AMERICAN. FOUR YEARS AGO, I CAME OUT A
STRAND GENDERED WHILE<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> SERVING AS
-- CAME OUT AS TRANSGENDERED
WHILE SERVING AS STUDENT BODY
PRESIDENT IN COLLEGE.
AT THE TIME COME I WAS SCARED.
I WAS WORRIED THAT MY DREAMS AND MY IDENTITY WERE MUTUALLY
EXCLUSIVE. SINCE THEN, I HAVE SEEN THE CHANGE IS POSSIBLE.
I WITNESSED HISTORY WHILE INTERNING AT THE WHITE HOUSE AND
HELPING MY HOME STATE OF
DELAWARE PASS PROTECTIONS FOR TRANSGENDERED PEOPLE. TODAY, I SEE THIS CHANGE IN THE WORK OF THE LGBT CAUCUS AND IN
MY OWN JOB AS PART OF THE HUMAN
RIGHTS CAMPAIGN.
DESPITE THIS PROGRESS, SO MUCH
WORK REMAINS.
WILL WE BE A NATION WHERE THERE
IS ONLY ONE WAY TO LOVE, ONLY
ONE WAY TO LOOK, ONLY ONE WAY TO
LIVE? OR WILL WE BE A NATION WHERE THERE IS MORE THAN ONE WAY TO
LIVE FREELY AND OPENLY? AND THEY -- A NATION THAT IS STRONGER TOGETHER?
THAT IS THE QUESTION. FOR ME, THIS STRUGGLE FOR
EQUALITY BECAME ALL THE MORE
URGENT WHEN I LEARNED THAT MY FUTURE HUSBAND, ANDREW, WAS BATTLING CANCER.
I MET ANDY, A TRANSGENDERED MAN
FIGHTING FOR EQUALITY, AND WE FELL IN LOVE.
EVEN IN THE FACE OF HIS TERMINAL
ILLNESS, HE NEVER WAVERED IN HIS
BELIEVE THAT THIS COUNTRY CAN
CHANGE. ANDY AND I MARRIED IN 2014.
JUST FOUR DAYS AFTER OUR WEDDING
HE PASSED AWAY. KNOWING A HANDY LEFT ME
PROFOUNDLY CHANGED, BUT MORE
THAN ANYTHING ELSE -- KNOWING ANDY LEFT ME PROFOUNDLY CHANGED, BUT MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE, IT MADE ME DETERMINED TO FIGHT FOR
WORLD WERE EVERYONE CAN LIVE TO
THEIR FULLEST. HILLARY CLINTON UNDERSTANDS THE
URGENCY OF OUR FIGHT. SHE WILL WORK WITH US TO PASS
THE EQUALITY ACT, TO COMBAT
VIOLENCE AGAINST TRANSGENDERED WOMEN OF COLOR,
AND TO END THE HIV-AIDS EPIDEMIC
ONCE AND FOR ALL. TODAY IN AMERICA, LGBTQ PEOPLE ARE STILL TARGETED I HATE THAT LIVES IN BOTH -- BY HATE THAT LIVES IN BOTH LAWS AND HEARTS. MANY STRUGGLE JUST TO GET BY. BUT I BELIEVE THAT TOMORROW CAN
BE DIFFERENT. TOMORROW, WE CAN BE RESPECTED AND PROTECTED, ESPECIALLY IF
HILLARY CLINTON IS OUR
PRESIDENT, AND THAT IS WHY I AM
PROUD TO STAND HERE AND THEY
THAT I WITH HER.
-- I'M WITH HER. THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH. CRACKS PLEASE WELCOME DOLORES FROM DAWSON, NEW MEXICO.</span><span class='hidden-full-transcript-ellipses'>...</span></p><a href='#' class='hidden-full-transcript-link'><i class='icon-chevron-down'></i> <span class='link-show-full-text'>Show Full Text</span><i class='icon-chevron-up'></i> <span class='link-show-less-text'>Show Less Text</span></a>
