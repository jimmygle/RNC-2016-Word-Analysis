<strong>James "Jim" F. Kenney</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> THANK YOU. PENNSYLVANIA! ON BEHALF OF THE GREAT PEOPLE OF THE CITY, WELCOME TO PHILADELPHIA. IT IS A CITY THAT MAKES HISTORY
AND WE ARE READY TO DO<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> IT AGAIN
WHEN HIS CONVENTION NOMINATES
THE FIRST WOMAN PRESIDENT OF THE
UNITED STATES. TODAY, HOWEVER, I WANT TO SHARE
A PHILADELPHIA STORY YOU
PROBABLY DON'T KNOW. IN 1844, AN EARLY VERSION OF A
KNOW NOTHING POLITICAL PARTY HELD A RALLY HERE TO PROTEST THE THREAT -- THEY CLAIMED THESE
IMMIGRANTS, PEOPLE LIKE MY FAMILY, WERE MORE LIKELY TO COMMIT CRIMES. DOES THAT SOUND FAMILIAR? THIS RHETORIC LED TO RIOTS. CHURCHES WERE BURNT TO THE
GROUND. 20 PEOPLE DIED. I AM TELLING YOU THIS STORY FOR
ONE REASON -- IT IS HAPPENING
AGAIN.
THE KNOW NOTHINGS HAVE RETURNED
AND LAST WEEK IN CLEVELAND, THEY VOWED TO TAKE THEIR COUNTRY BACK
IN NOVEMBER. THEY GOT IT ALL WRONG.
IT WAS NEVER THEIR COUNTRY IN
THE FIRST PLACE. WHETHER OUR FAMILIES CAME TO
THIS COUNTRY IN 1776 OR 1976, OR
2016, THIS COUNTRY BELONGS TO
ALL OF US. MANY OF US THOUGHT WE DEFEATED
THE KNOW NOTHINGS EIGHT YEARS AGO WHEN WE WERE YET -- WHEN WE ELECTED OUR FIRST BLACK PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA. BUT THE FACT IS THAT MEANINGFUL CHANGE NEVER HAPPENS ALL AT ONCE.
YOU HAVE TO FIGHT FOR IT. PHILADELPHIA BECAME THE FIRST
MAJOR CITY TO PASS THE SODA TAX
THAT WILL FUND PRE-K, COMMITTEE SCHOOLS, AND PARKS AND RECREATION CENTERS ALL
THROUGHOUT THE CITY. RECENTLY, I WAS SPEAKING TO AN
IMMIGRANT RESTAURANT OWNER WHO
TOLD ME HE'S UP FOR THE TAX EVEN
THOUGH HE SELLS -- SUPPORTED THE TAX EVEN THOUGH HE SELLS SODAS
BECAUSE IT WOULD HELP THE NEIGHBORHOOD CHILDREN. WE DID NOT COME HERE JUST TO GET
RICH. WE CAME HERE TO MAKE A BETTER LIFE FOR US AND EVERYONE ELSE. WE HAVE TO COME TOGETHER. WHEN THIS COUNTRY COMES TOGETHER, FAMILIES WHO HAVE TO
CHOOSE BETWEEN HEALTH CARE AND
GROCERIES ARE NO LONGER HUNGRY AND SICK. WHEN WE COME TOGETHER, THE KNOW NOTHINGS WHO OVERRAN PHILADELPHIA IN 1844 WILL
FINALLY BE DEFEATED WITH THE ELECTION OF HILLARY CLINTON AS
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES IN 2016. LET'S GET TO WORK. ENJOY PHILADELPHIA.</span><span class='hidden-full-transcript-ellipses'>...</span></p><a href='#' class='hidden-full-transcript-link'><i class='icon-chevron-down'></i> <span class='link-show-full-text'>Show Full Text</span><i class='icon-chevron-up'></i> <span class='link-show-less-text'>Show Less Text</span></a>
