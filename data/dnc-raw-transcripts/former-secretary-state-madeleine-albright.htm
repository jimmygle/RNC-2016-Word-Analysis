<strong>Madeleine K. Albright</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH. MY FELLOW AMERICANS, GOOD EVENING. 68 YEARS AGO DURING A TIME OF GRAVE DANGER, DEMOCRATS GATHERED<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> IN PHILADELPHIA TO NOMINATE A TOUGH, SMART, EXPERIENCED PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE. AT THE TIME, I WAS A CHILD IN
EUROPE WHERE I LIVED IN FEAR
BECAUSE MY NATIVE CZECHOSLOVAKIA
HAD BEEN TAKEN OVER BY
COMMUNISTS. WITHIN A FEW MONTHS, MY FAMILY FOUND THAT AGE IN AMERICA AND
HARRY TRUMAN BECAME MY FIRST AMERICAN PRESIDENT [APPLAUSE] TONIGHT, IN PHILADELPHIA, WE
NOMINATED SOMEONE WITH TRUMAN'S
FIGHTING SPIRIT TO BE OUR NEXT
PRESIDENT, HILLARY CLINTON.
[APPLAUSE] AND THIS FALL, WE MUST DO
EVERYTHING WE CAN TO MAKE SURE HILLARY BECOMES OUR NEXT COMMANDER IN CHIEF.
[APPLAUSE] BECAUSE IN THIS ERA WITH THIS STRESS, WE NEED A LEADER WHO HAS THE ARIANS AND JUDGMENT TO KEEP AMERICA STRONG, SECURE, AND
SAFE. I KNOW HILLARY CLINTON WILL BE THAT PRESIDENT BECAUSE I HAVE KNOWN HER FROM WHEN A 25 YEARS,
BECAUSE I'VE SEEN HER FIGHT AND WIN./ WHEN HILLARY WAS FIRST LADY, WE WENT TO THE BEIJING WOMEN'S CONFERENCE AND SHE SPOKE OUT ON
BEHALF OF HUMAN RIGHTS AND WOMEN
RIGHTS. WE WENT TO PRAGUE WHERE I SHOWED HER THE CITY OF MY BIRTH AND
MADE HER EAT CHECK CABBAGE. WHICH SHE DIDN'T LIKE VERY MUCH. AND WHEN HILLARY SERVED AS SECRETARY OF STATE, I WATCHED
HER PARTNER WITH PRESIDENT OBAMA TO RESTORE OUR COUNTRY'S
REPUTATION AROUND THE WORLD. SHE FOUGHT TERRORISM, STOPPED
THE SPREAD OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS, AND PROMOTED DIPLOMACY, DEFENSE, DEVELOPMENT AND DEMOCRACY, SMART POWER IN EVERY CORNER OF THE
WORLD. AS I TRAVEL AROUND THE WORLD
TODAY, I'M REMINDED HOW
IMPORTANT IT IS THAT THE PERSON
WHO REPRESENTS OUR NATION A'S TRUSTED BY OUR ALLY'S. HILLARY AND I SHARE A FEW THINGS
IN COMMON. WE BOTH WENT TO RELATIVELY COLLEGE. WE ARE BOTH MOTHERS AND
GRANDMOTHERS.
SO I KNOW WHERE SHE GOT HER
MANAGEMENT SKILLS. WE ARE BOTH VERY PROUD OF OUR
DAUGHTERS AND GRANDSONS SO WE
MUST HAVE DONE SOMETHING RIGHT.
WE ALSO KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO STEP OFF THAT PLANE WITH THE
WORDS UNITED STATES OF AMERICA ON THE.
SHE KNOWS SAFEGUARDING FREEDOM AND SECURITY IS NOW LIKE HOSTING
A TV REALITY SHOW. IT IS A COMPLEX, ROUND-THE-CLOCK
JOB THAT DEMANDS NOT ONLY A
STEADY HAND AND A COOL HEAD BUT A BIG HEART. YOU ARE NOT JUST REPRESENTING YOURSELF, YOU ARE THERE FOR ALL OF US.
HILLARY HAS DISPLAYED THESE
QUALITIES EVERY JOB SHE'S EVER
HAD AND LAST WEEK IN CLEVELAND, WE WERE REMINDED THAT HER UP
FROM IT POSSESSES NONE OF THOSE. MANY HAVE ARGUED THAT DONALD WOULD HARM OUR NATIONAL SECURITY IF HE WERE ELECTED PRESIDENT. THE FACT IS HE HAS ALREADY DONE DAMAGE JUST BY RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] HE HAS UNDERMINED OUR FIGHT AGAINST TERRORISM BUT ALIENATING OUR MUSLIM PARTNERS, HE HAS WEEKEND ARTS ENDING IN THE WORLD BURN THREATENING TO WALK AWAY
FROM OUR FRIENDS AND ALLIES AND BY ENCOURAGING MORE COUNTRIES TO
GET NUCLEAR WEAPONS. DONALD TRUMP ALSO HAS A STRANGE
ADMIRATION FOR DICTATORS. WHEN ASKED ABOUT VLADIMIR PUTIN,
DONALD TRUMP SAID "IN TERMS OF LEADERSHIP, HE'S GETTING AN A." A TRUMPET VICTORY IN NOVEMBER
WOULD THE A GIFT TO VLADIMIR PUTIN AND GIVEN WHAT WE HAVE
LEARNED ABOUT THE RUSSIANS RATION ACTIONS, VLADIMIR PUTIN
IS EAGER TO SEE WHEN -- WIN.
[APPLAUSE] AND THAT SHOULD WORRY EVERY
AMERICAN.
TAKE IT FROM SOMEONE WHO FLED
THE IRON CURTAIN.
I KNOW WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU
GIVE THE RUSSIANS A GREEN LIGHT. TRUMP'S DARK VISION OF AMERICA,
ONE THAT'S ISOLATED IN THE WORLD
AND ALIENATED FROM OUR ALLIES
WOULD BE A DISASTER. WE MUST MAKE SURE THIS NEVER
HAPPENS. WE MUST ELECT HILLARY CLINTON AS
OUR NEXT PRESIDENT. AT THE AGE OF 11, I SAILED PAST
THE STATUE OF LIBERTY AND
STARTED MY LIFE IN THE WORLD'S GREATEST DEMOCRACY.
I AM SO GRATEFUL TO OUR COUNTRY AND I AM SUPPORTING HILLARY CLINTON BECAUSE I LOVE IT.
GOD BLESS AMERICA AND GOD BLESS
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.
