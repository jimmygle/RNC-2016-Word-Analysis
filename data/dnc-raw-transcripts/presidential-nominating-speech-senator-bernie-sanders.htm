<strong>Tulsi Gabbard</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> MY FELLOW DEMOCRATS -- MY FELLOW DEMOCRATS, MY FELLOW AMERICANS, ALTHOUGH HALF -- ALOHA.PEOPLE HAVE ASKED ME HOW A 70-YEAR-OLD GUY COULD
BECOME THE<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> VOICE FOR MILLIONS. CONNECTING SEAMLESSLY WITH -- FROM THE RUST BELT AND ENVIRONMENTALISTS FROM THE WEST,
THE ANSWER LIES IN HIS ALOHA, IN
HIS DEEP LOVE FOR OTHERS AND OUR
MOTHER EARTH. AS BERNIE HAS SAID, THE TRUTH IS
WHEN YOU HURT, WHEN YOUR
CHILDREN HURT, I HEARD.
WHEN MY KIDS -- I HURT. WHEN MY KIDS HURT, I HURT.
THIS IS A MOVEMENT OF LOVE, LOVE
WHICH CALLS UPON US TO CARE, TO
CARE FOR FAMILIES TORN APART BY
OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM, TO
CARE FOR FOLKS WHOSE JOBS HAVE VANISHED AS A DESTRUCTIVE TRADE DEALS, TO CARE FOR THOSE BARELY SCRAPING BY AT WOMEN THEM -- AT
MINIMUM WAGE AND THOSE CRIPPLED
BY COLLEGE DEBT, TO CARE ABOUT OUR ENVIRONMENT AND FUTURE GENERATIONS, TO CARE ABOUT LIVES
LOST, LIVES RUINED, AND
COUNTRIES DESTROYED BY COUNTERPRODUCTIVE REGIME CHANGE
WARS. TO CARE FOR OUR VETERANS WHO
HAVE PUT THEIR LIVES ON THE LINE
FOR OUR COUNTRY, WHO NOW FACE UNACCEPTABLE DELAYS AND INADEQUATE CARE. THIS MOVEMENT OF LOVE AND
COMPASSION IS BIGGER THAN ANY
ONE OF US. IT SPEAKS TO OUR NATION'S CONSCIENCE AND OUR HEARTS. THIS LOSS OPENS EACH OF OUR EYES
TO THE TRUTH, THAT EVERY HUNGRY
CHILD IS MY CHILD, THAT EVERY WORKER SEEKING THE DIGNITY OF A JOB IS MY NEIGHBOR, EVERY SENIOR CITIZEN IN NEED OF CARE IS MY PARENT, BUT AN ATTACK ON ANYONE BECAUSE OF THEIR RACE, RELIGION,
OR SEXUAL ORIENTATION IS AN
ATTACK ON ALL OF US. IT IS WHEN WE TRULY CARE FOR EACH OTHER, CHOOSING INCLUSION
AND LOVE OVER DIVISIONS AND HATRED THAT THIS GREAT COUNTRY
IS TRULY AT ITS GREATEST. LET US DRAW INSPIRATION FROM THE WORDS OF MAHATMA GANDHI -- A
SMALL BODY OF DETERMINED SPIRITS
FIRED BY AN UNQUENCHABLE FAITH
IN THEIR MISSION CAN ALTER THE COURSE OF HISTORY. NOW, MY FRIENDS, BECAUSE THIS IS
A MOVEMENT FUELED BY LOVE, IT
CAN NEVER BE STOPPED OR
DEFEATED. NOW ON BEHALF OF MILLIONS INSPIRED BY ALOHA, DETERMINED TO
SEEK A FUTURE ROOTED IN LOVE,
COMPASSION, AND JUSTICE FOR ALL,
AND DEDICATED TO A GOVERNMENT FOR THE PEOPLE, BY THE PEOPLE, I
AM TRULY HONORED TO NOMINATE BERNIE SANDERS FOR PRESIDENT OF
THE UNITED STATES.
