<strong>Keith Ellison</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> HOW ARE YOU DOING, DEMOCRATS?
[CHEERING] TONIGHT, BUT DEMOCRATS, WE ARE
UNITED AROUND THE MOST
PROGRESSIVE PLATFORM IN HISTORY.
[CHEERING] THE MOST<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> PRO--- PROGRESSIVE
PLATFORM IN HISTORY. 50 GOING OUR MINIMUM WAGE. BANNING PRIVATE PRISONS. EXPANDING SOCIAL SECURITY. THE PUBLIC OPTION. AND DEBT FREE COLLEGE TUITION.
[CHEERING] THAT IS THE PLATFORM THAT BERNIE SANDERS AND HILLARY CLINTON
WROTE TOGETHER.
[CHEERING] AND THAT IS THE PLATFORM THAT WE CAN MAKE THE LAW OF THE LAND IF WE STAND TOGETHER, IF WE WORK TOGETHER AND IF WE VOTE TOGETHER ON NOVEMBER 8.
[CHEERING] YOU KNOW, TRUMP, HE WANTS TO
DIVIDE AND CONQUER US WITH HIS ANTI-MUSLIM, ANTI-MEXICAN, ANTI-WORKER MESSAGE. THEY DON'T WANT US TO VOTE. THEY WANT TO PUSH VOTER ID LAWS THAT BLOCK BLACK AND LATINO
VOTERS. PAUL RYAN WANT EVEN ALLOW A VOTE
TO RESTORE VOTING RIGHTS ACT. WE MUST PUSH BACK. VOTING IS NOT -- NOT VOTING IS
NOT A PROTEST, IT IS A
SURRENDER.
[CHEERING] WHEN THEY BRING THE FEAR, WE
BRING THE KURDS. WHEN THEY BRING THE DIVISION, WE
BRING THE UNITY.
[CHEERING] AS A PROUD, AND THAT'S A PROUD
BERNIE SANDERS SUPPORTER, --
[CHEERING] I WILL ALWAYS REMEMBER FEELING
THE BERN IN MINNESOTA.
[CHEERING] THERE ARE MY MINNESOTANS OVER
THERE. 6000 IN THE. 14,000, ST. PAUL. BERNIE STARTED THE BEGINNING OF
A REVOLUTION.
[CHEERING] HE PACKED THEM IN FROM DAVENPORT TO DETROIT. YORKTOWN -- YOUR TOWN TO MY.
13 MILLION AMERICANS VOTED FOR
PROGRESSIVE DIES AND MILLIONS
MORE MADE AN INVESTMENT IN
BUILDING THAT MOVEMENT $27 AT A
TIME.
[CHEERING] TOGETHER, TOGETHER WE CALL FOR
JUSTICE. WE CALL FOR RACIAL JUSTICE.
WE CALL FOR WAGE JUSTICE.
[CHEERING] AND YOU KNOW WHAT, WE MADE OUR
VOICES HEARD. AND TOGETHER, DEMOCRATS, WE WILL MAKE OUR VOICES HEARD IN
NOVEMBER WHEN WE DEFEAT DONALD TRUMP.
[CHEERING] AND ELECT HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON
TO THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.
[CHEERING] TONIGHT, LET US RAISE OUR VOICES AND GRATITUDE TO THE MAN WHO HAS HELPED MAKE THIS GREAT PARTY
GREATER THAN EVER. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I GIVE YOU BERNIE SANDERS!
[CHEERING]
