<strong>Tony Goldwyn</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> HILLARY CLINTON HAS SPOKEN OF
WATCHING NELSON MANDELA AND EMBRACE HIS FORMER JAILERS BECAUSE HE DIDN'T WANT TO BE IMPRISONED TWICE, ONCE BY
STEALING<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> CONCRETE, ONCE BY ANGER
AND BITTERNESS. I HAVE WORKED FOR YEARS WITH THE
INNOCENCE PROJECT, THE
EXTRAORDINARY ORGANIZATION THAT
FIGHTS TO EXONERATE THE WRONGFULLY CONVICTED AND I HAVE NEVER HEARD A SINGLE EXONERATE, MANY OF HOME HAS SPENT DECADES
IN PRISON FOR CRIMES THEY DID
NOT COMMIT, I HAVE NEVER HEARD THEM SPEAK OF ANGER OR OUTRAGE,
ONLY OF THEIR DESIRE TO REFORM THE SYSTEM SO THAT OTHERS MIGHT BE SPARED THEIR SUFFERING.
[APPLAUSE] I AM PROUD TONIGHT TO INTRODUCE A GROUP OF WOMEN PROFOUNDLY IMPACTED BY INJUSTICE AND VIOLENCE WHO HAVE TURNED THEIR
PAIN INTO POWER AND THEIR OUTRAGE INTO ACTION. THEY ARE THE MOTHERS OF THE
MOVEMENT.
[APPLAUSE] THEY UNDERSTAND THAT WE MUST
REACH OUT TO EACH OTHER BECAUSE OF OUR DIVERSITY, BECAUSE WE ARE
STRONGER TOGETHER. HILLARY SAYS WE CAN'T HIDE FROM
THESE HARD TRUTHS ABOUT RACE AND JUSTICE IN AMERICA. WE HAVE TO NAME THEM AND OWN THEM AND THEN CHANGE THEM. THAT IS WHAT SHE WILL DO AS PRESIDENT AND THE MOTHERS OF THE MOVEMENT CREW TAKE ONE LIFE AT A
TIME, ONE MOTHER AT A TIME, WE
CAN CHANGE THE WORLD.
THANK YOU.
