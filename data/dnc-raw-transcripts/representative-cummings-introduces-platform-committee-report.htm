<strong>Elijah Cummings</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> MR. CUMMINGS: MADAM CHAIR, HONORED DELEGATES, AND MY FELLOW DEMOCRATS, I STAND BEFORE YOU HERE TODAY NOT AS A CONGRESSMAN
FROM THE INNER CITY OF BALTIMORE,<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> BUT AS A SON OF FORMER SHARECROPPERS WHO STARTED
ON A FARM IN SOUTH CAROLINA WIT H NO RUNNING WATER, NO TOILET,
BUT WHO BELIEVED IN EDUCATION
AND TAUGHT THEIR CHILDREN THE
VALUE OF HELPING OTHERS. MY FATHER, THE LATE ROBERT CUMMINGS, A MAN WHO LEFT SCHOOL
AFTER THE FOURTH GRADE TO PLOW
THE FIELDS AND PICK THE COTTON,
HE IS ONE OF THE SMARTEST PEOPLE
I HAVE EVER KNOWN. HE SAID, SON , THE ETTEST OF
A MAN IS NOT HOW MUCH HE HELPED HIMSELF. THE TRUE TEST IS WHETHER HE HELPS THOSE LESS FORTUNATE.
[APPLAUSE] HE WOULD SAY, SON, YOU GO TO SCHOOL TO GET BLESESED SO YOU CAN BLESS. THAT IS THE STANDARD BY WHICH HE MEASURED ME GROWING UP AND IS THE STANDARD I WHICH I STILL MEASURE MYSELF. IT IS THE STANDARD WE DEMOCRATS USE TODAY. I STAND BEFORE YOU BECAUSE MY PARENTS SAW PROMISE IN THEIR SEVEN CHILDREN. MY PARENTS DID NOT DO IT ALONE. NO ONE DOES IT

ALONE. IT WAS OUR DEMOCRATIC PARTY THAT PUSHED OPEN THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR ME AND MILLIONS OF CHILDREN
ACROSS THIS GREAT COUNTRY. IT WAS OUR PARTY THAT FOUGHT FOR HEAD START AND GOOD SCHOOLS. AND MADE COLLEGE AFFORDABLE AND CHAMPIONED AFFIRMATIVE ACTIONS AND SCHOOL DESEGREGATION, THAT PASSED SOCIAL SECURITY AND MEDICARE, THAT FOUGHT FOR
VETERANS BACK HOME, THAT FOUGHT
FOR THE RIGHTS OF WORKERS AND
MADE THE DREAM OF HOME OWNERSHIP POSSIBLE FOR MILLIONS OF
AMERICAN FAMILIES. YES, IT STILL IS OUR DEMOCRATIC
PARTY. CIVIL RIGHTS AND VOTING RIGHTS
-- AND VOTING RIGHTS. AS WE DEMOCRATS -- IT IS WE DEMOCRATS WHO FULLY UNDERSTAND WHEN YOU TAKE AWAY A PERSON'S
RIGHT TO VOTE, YOU TAKE AWAY
THEIR ABILITY TO SHAPE THEIR OWN DESTINY. AND IT WAS AND IT IS OUR DEMOCRATIC PARTY THAT FIGHTS FOR WOMEN'S RIGHTS, GAY RIGHT, THE LGBTQ RIGHTS. OUR PARTY UNDERSTANDS THAT BLACK
LIVES MATTER.
[CHEERS] MR. CUMMINGS: BUT WE ALSO
RECOGNIZE THAT OUR COMMUNITIES AND OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT WORK BEST WHEN THEY WORK TOGETHER. OUR PARTY, OUR PARTY, OUR PARTY KNOWS THE DIVERSITY -- THAT
DIVERSITY IS NOT A PROBLEM, BUT
IS A PROMISE. AND THAT IS WHY, LADIES AND
GENTLEMEN, THAT IS WHY OURS IS A
PARTY OF UNITY AND NOT DIVISION. I AM PROUD THAT OUR PARTY'S PLATFORM WILL HELP NOT THE
WEALTHY, NOT THE 1%, BUT IT WILL HELP OUR STRUGGLING MIDDLE
CLASS, OUR WORKING FAMILIES, THE DISADVANTAGED, AND DISABLED. IT WILL HELP THE LESS FORTUNATE. OUR PLATFORM HAS HAD -- AND IT
HAS DONE SO NOT BY SEEKING COMMON GROUND, BUT ASPIRING TO
HIGHER GROUND. IT ENVISIONS A NATION WHERE WE
DO NOT ONLY AN ACT A MINIMUM
WAGE, BUT A LIVING WAGE. WE AS DEMOCRATS VALUE EVERY LIFE, BLACK, WHITE, ASIAN, EVERY
LIFE. IT ENVISIONS OUR NATION WHERE WE DO NOT HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN
PROTECTING THE ENVIRONMENT AND
CREATING JOBS, BUT WHERE WE CAN
DEFEND OUR PLANET AGAINST GLOBAL
WARMING WHILE AT THE SAME TIME
AND ACTING POLICIES THAT FOSTER JOB CREATION, INCENTIVIZE NEW STARTUPS, AND BRING EXPATRIATED
JOBS BACK HOME. IT ENVISIONS A NATION WHERE EVERY CHILD CAN GET A FIRST-RATE EDUCATION, EVERY SCHOOL EQUIPPED
TO COMPETE IN A GLOBAL ECONOMY. IT ENVISIONS AN AMERICAN A IN
WHICH WE PROTECT A WOMAN'S RIGHT TO CHOOSE. WHERE EVERYONE CAN GET THE HEALTH CARE THEY NEED WHEN THEY
NEED IT. REGARDLESS OF THEIR ZIP CODE OR CIRCUMSTANCE. BECAUSE HEALTH CARE IN OUR
COUNTRY IS NOT A PRIVILEGE. IT IS NOW, THANKS TO PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA, OUR RIGHT AS AMERICANS. AND SO, MADAM CHAIR, WHEN I SAY
MY PRAYERS AT NIGHT AND I LOOK
UP TO THE HEAVENS, I SEE THE STARS, AND SOMETIMES I SEE MY FATHER.
I KNOW TONIGHT IS SMILING ON ALL OF US, AND HE, LIKE ME, IS PROUD, PROUD OF OUR PLATFORM COMMITTEE, AND OUR GREAT
NOMINEE, HILLARY CLINTON, AND OUR PARTY'S BRIGHT FUTURE. AND IF MY FATHER, THAT BRILLIANT MAN, WITH A FOURTH-GRADE EDUCATION, BUT A MIND FULL OF
WISDOM AND COMMON SENSE, WERE STANDING HERE WITH US TONIGHT, I
KNOW HE WOULD BE PROUD OF ALL OF YOU, AND HE WOULD SAY THESE WORDS -- THAT THIS ELECTION IS
BIGGER THAN HILLARY CLINTON,
BIGGER THAN BERNIE SANDERS, IT
IS BIGGER THAN ALL OF US. IT IS ABOUT GENERATIONS YET UNBORN. AND HE WOULD SAY THESE SIMPLE WORDS -- YOU ARE BLESSED, SO YOU CAN BLESS OTHERS. GO OUT THERE AND VOTE AND DO NOT STOP LIFTING UP THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. MAY GOD BLESS AMERICA!
[CHEERS]
