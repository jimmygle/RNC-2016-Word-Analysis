<strong>Barbara Boxer</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> SENATOR BOXER: YOU LOOK
BEAUTIFUL OUT THERE. I HAVE A QUESTION.
ARE YOU READY TO ELECT THE VERY
FIRST WOMAN PRESIDENT OF THESE
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA?<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> LET ME HEAR IT. YES. I WANT TO TALK TO YOU VERY PERSONALLY, BECAUSE I HAVE KNOWN
HILLARY CLINTON FOR MORE THAN 20
YEARS. WE ARE ACTUALLY FAMILY. MY DAUGHTER WAS MARRIED TO HER BROTHER, SO MY BELOVED GRANDSON
IS HER BELOVED NEPHEW. YES. SO I KNOW HER.
I KNOW HER AS THE LOVING AUNT,
WHO HELPED PLAN MY GRANDSON'S BIRTHDAY PARTIES WHEN HE WAS
JUST A LITTLE TODDLER. AND I SAW HER RUSH OVER AFTER A
BUSY DAY AT THE STATE DEPARTMENT
TO CHEER HIM ON AT HIS HIGH
SCHOOL FOOTBALL GAMES. AND SHE WAS OFTEN JOINED BY HER DEVOTED MOTHER, DOROTHY. DOROTHY, WHO OVERCAME A PAINFUL CHILDHOOD, AND TAUGHT HILLARY
HOW ONE CARING PERSON CAN MAKE A
CHANGE IN A CHILD'S LIFE. DOROTHY ONCE WROTE ME A LETTER,
AND SHE SAID THIS. I CAN'T REMEMBER WHEN HILLARY DIDN'T TAKE THE LONG VIEW OF
THINGS. IT WAS NEVER INSTANT GRATIFICATION. SHE WROTE, THAT STRONG SENSE OF
EMPATHY FOR OTHERS AND A GREAT SENSE OF HUMOR HAVE SERVED HER
WELL. NOW, THAT IS A MOM WHO KNEW HER DAUGHTER WELL. NOW, WE SAW HILLARY'S HEART, HER
HEART, WHEN, AS FIRST LADY, SHE WORKED ACROSS PARTY LINES TO BRING HEALTH CARE TO MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF CHILDREN. WE SAW HER STRENGTH WHEN, AFTER 9/11, SHE'S GOOD WITH FIRST RESPONDERS -- STOOD WITH FIRST
RESPONDERS AND TERSELY FOUGHT FOR THEM. WE SAW HER STRENGTH AND LEADERSHIP, WHEN, AS SECRETARY
OF STATE, HILLARY CLINTON RESTORED AMERICA'S STANDING IN
THE WORLD. YOU REMEMBER THAT, AFTER THE
BUSH ADMINISTRATION, AND I PERSONALLY SAW THE LIGHT IN HER
EYES WHEN SHE BECAME A
GRANDMOTHER, AND HER FIGHT FOR A BETTER AMERICA BECAME EVEN MORE PERSONAL AND EVEN MORE URGENT. NOW, DURING THIS CAMPAIGN, WE
HAVE SEEN SOMETHING ELSE. HER TOUGHNESS.
AND I KNOW A LITTLE BIT ABOUT
TOUGHNESS. NOW, THE RIGHT-WING HAS THROWN EVERYTHING IT HILLARY.
NOT ONLY THE KITCHEN SINK, NOT ONLY THE STOVE, BUT THE
REFRIGERATOR AND THE TOASTERS TOO, AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
SHE'S STILL STANDING. THEY HAVE THROWN EVERYTHING AT
HER AND SHE'S STILL STANDING. AMERICA'S FAMILIES NEED HILLARY IN THE WHITE HOUSE, STANDING WITH ALL OF US. WE NEED A PRESIDENT WHO KNOWS IT'S JUST PLAIN WRONG THAT WOMEN MAKE $.79 FOR EVERY ONE DOLLAR
PAID TO A MAN. AND YET, HER OPPONENT REFUSES TO SUPPORT EQUAL PAY.
HE SAYS THE MARKETPLACE WILL
MAKE SURE OF IT. WELL, IT'S 2016, AND WE'RE STILL
WAITING, MR. TRUMP. WE CAN COUNT ON HILLARY TO FIGHT TO RAISE THE MINIMUM WAGE. HER OPPONENT SAYS WAGES ARE TOO HIGH. THAT'S UN-AMERICAN. IN OUR GREAT COUNTRY, IF YOU
WORK FULL TIME, YOU SHOULD NEVER, EVER, HAVE TO LIVE IN
POVERTY. WE CAN COUNT ON HILLARY. WE CAN COUNT ON HILLARY TO
PROTECT OUR RIGHT TO CHOOSE. HER OPPONENT SAID A WOMAN SHOULD BE PUNISHED FOR EXERCISING HER
RIGHT TO CHOOSE. AND THEN PICKED A RUNNING MATE
WHO BELIEVES ROE V WADE BELONGS, TO QUOTE HIM, IN THE ASH KEEP OF
HISTORY.
WELL, I HAVE A MESSAGE FOR DONALD TRUMP AND MIKE PENCE.
WE ARE NOT GOING BACK TO THE
DARK AGES. WHEN WOMEN DIED IN BACK ALLEYS. WE ARE NEVER, EVER, EVER GOING
BACK. NEVER. YOU KNOW, THERE IS A LOT OF TALK ABOUT WHAT MAKES AMERICA GREAT.
I WILL TELL YOU THIS. IT'S NOT WHEN WE INSULT EACH
OTHER. IT'S NOT WHEN WE TEAR EACH OTHER
DOWN. IT'S WHEN WE STAND TOGETHER. IT'S WHEN WE WORK TOGETHER. IT'S WHEN WE BUILD TOGETHER.
IT'S WHEN WE FIGHT TOGETHER. AND THAT'S WHAT MAKES AMERICA
GREAT. AND THAT'S WHAT HILLARY CLINTON
WILL DO.
AND THAT IS WHY I'M TELLING YOU
TONIGHT, HILLARY CLINTON WILL BE
OUR NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED
STATES OF AMERICA.
THANK YOU, CALIFORNIA.
THANK YOU, AMERICA. THANK YOU.</span><span class='hidden-full-transcript-ellipses'>...</span></p><a href='#' class='hidden-full-transcript-link'><i class='icon-chevron-down'></i> <span class='link-show-full-text'>Show Full Text</span><i class='icon-chevron-up'></i> <span class='link-show-less-text'>Show Less Text</span></a>
