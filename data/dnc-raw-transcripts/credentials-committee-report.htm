<strong>James Roosevelt Jr.</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> MR. ROOSEVELT: HELLO TO ALL THE PARTICIPANTS IN THE 2016
DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL CONVENTION.
IT IS AN HONOR TO HAVE SERVED AS
A COCHAIR OF THE CREDENTIALS<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> COMMITTEE ALONG WITH MY FRIEND LORAINE MILLER. ON SUNDAY, THE CREDENTIALS COMMITTEE ADOPTED THE REPORT
THAT IS NOW CONTAINED IN THE
STANDING COMMITTEE REPORT. CONSIDERATION OF THIS REPORT IS THE FIRST ORDER OF BUSINESS FOR THIS 47TH DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL CONVENTION SO THE DELEGATES AND ALTERNATES TODAY CAN BE OFFICIALLY SEATED. I'M PROUD TO SAY THAT THERE ARE NO UNRESOLVED CREDENTIALS ISSUES
TO BE DECIDED BY THE CREDENTIALS COMMITTEE.
[APPLAUSE] THIS NOMINATING PROCESS WAS AN
EXTRAORDINARY MARATHON. THERE WAS HISTORIC VOTER TURNOUT AND AN ENTHUSIASM ABOUT THE
ELECTION THAT ENGAGED AND ENCOURAGED PEOPLE TO PARTICIPATE FOR THE FIRST TIME. THIS ENTHUSIASM HAS CARRIED ON
EVEN AFTER THE LAST CONTEST
WHICH WAS IN WASHINGTON, D.C. I'M EXCITED THAT WE ALL STAND
UNITED HERE TODAY TO GET ON WITH
NOMINATING THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF
THE UNITED STATES.
[APPLAUSE] I'M PLEASED THAT AS PART OF THIS COMMITTEE'S REPORTS OF THE CONVENTION, THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY RECOGNIZES THAT WE ARE STRONGER
TOGETHER AS WE MAKE A PRIORITY
OF ENSURING THE DIVERSITY OF OUR
PARTY IS HIGHLIGHTED. IT IS NOW MY PLEASURE TO TURN
THIS OVER TO MY COCHAIR,
LORAINE MILLER.
