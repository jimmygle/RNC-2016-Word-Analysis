<strong>Thomas "Tom" Harkin</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> MR. HARKIN: THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ALL RIGHT, IOWA. 26 YEARS AGO TODAY, 26 YEARS AGO
TODAY OUR NATION WON A HARD-FOUGHT ADULT AND
DETERMINATION FOR OVER<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> 50 MILLION PEOPLE WHEN WE SIGNED INTO LAW THE AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT, THE ADA. TODAY I AM PROUD TO SAY THE ADA
HAS HELPED SO MANY SHARE IN AMERICA'S PROMISE. WE ARE BETTER PREPARED TO GET ALL OUR CHILDREN ACCESS TO QUALITY EDUCATION, HELP OUR WOUNDED WARRIORS WHEN THEY COME HOME, AND SUPPORT OUR AGING
POPULATION. WE GOT THIS DONE BECAUSE THE DISABILITY COMMUNITY UNDERSTOOD
AND NEW WHAT HILLARY CLINTON KNOWS -- WE ARE STRONGER TOGETHER. WE BROUGHT TOGETHER RUGGED AND DEMOCRATS, BUSINESSES AND
ADVOCATES. WE STOOD UP TO FEAR AND
IRRATIONAL PREJUDICES. WE ARE A BETTER NATION BECAUSE
OF THE ADA. BUT WE STILL HAVE A WAY TO GO
BEFORE WE BUILT A TRULY INCLUSIVE AMERICA, WHEN 26 YEARS LATER 70% OF ADULTS WITH DISABILITIES IN AMERICA ARE NOT IN THE WORKFORCE. IT IS TIME TO TAKE ACTION. AND THAT IS WHY HILLARY CLINTON
WANTS TO ENSURE THAT PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES ARE JUDGED BY THEIR POTENTIAL AND HAVE THE TOOLS TO SECURE REPETITIVE, INTEGRATE EMPLOYMENTD. WHEN, 26 YEARS LATER, EMPLOYERS ARE STILL ALLOWED TO PAY PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES BELOW THE
MINIMUM WAGE, IT IS TIME TO
CHANGE THAT LAW. HILLARY CLINTON WILL FIGHT TO ELIMINATE THE SELF MINIMUM WAGE
AND ENSURE A FAIR DAY'S WORK
EARNS A FAIR DAY'S PAY. WHEN, 26 YEARS LATER, MEDICAID
STILL KEEPS PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES IN WORKING HOMES,
IT IS TIME TO PASS SENATOR CHUCK SCHUMER'S DISABILITY INTEGRATION ACT SO THAT OUR FELLOW AMERICANS
CAN LIVE WHERE THEY WANT, A BILL
HILLARY CLINTON WILL SIGN INTO LAW AS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED
STATES. ONLY ONE PERSON SEEKING THE PRESIDENCY UNDERSTANDS THE DISABILITY COMMUNITY'S PHRASE NOTHING ABOUT US
WITHOUT US. ERIC SAID IT WILL BRING THE
COMMUNITY TO THE TABLE FOR A
MORE INCLUSIVE AMERICA.
NOW I LEARNED SIGN LANGUAGE FROM
MY BROTHER FRANK WHEN I WAS
GROWING UP. AND NOW I WANT TO TEACH ALL OF YOU AND BEAUTIFUL SIGN, WHICH CONNECTS WITH THE VALUES OF THIS CAMPAIGN. YOU READY?
I AM GOING TO TEACH YOU THIS
SIGN.
TAKE YOUR TWO HANDS -- COME ON,
IT IS AUDIENCE PARTICIPATION
TIME -- TAKE YOUR FINGERS AND
PUT THEM TOGETHER LIKE THIS.
OK, YOU GOT EVERYBODY? OVER THERE, PUT YOUR HANDS TOGETHER LIKE THIS, AND MOVE IT
IN A CIRCLE IN FRONT OF YOUR BODY. THAT, MY FRIENDS, IS + 4 -- IS THE SIGN FOR AMERICA. IT IS A BEAUTIFUL SIGN. THINK ABOUT IT, WE ARE ALL TOGETHER, WE'RE ALTOGETHER.
NO ONE IS LEFT OUT IN THIS CONSTANT CIRCLE OF LIFE THAT IS
AMERICA. THAT -- THAT -- THAT THAT IS THE AMERICA THAT WE ALL WANT --
DISABLED AND NONDISABLED ALIKE,
IT IS A BEAUTIFUL AMERICA THAT
HILLARY CLINTON WILL FIGHT FOR FOR EVERY PERSON, EVERY PERSON IS RESPECTED, VALUED, AND
TREATED WITH DIGNITY. THANK YOU.
