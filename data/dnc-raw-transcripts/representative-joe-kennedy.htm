<strong>Joseph "Joe" P. Kennedy III</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> THANK YOU. THANK YOU THANK YOU.
[CHEERING] MY FIRST DAY OF LAW SCHOOL, MY
VERY FIRST CLASS, THE GOAL
ESCAPE UNSCATHED. NOT THREE SECONDS IN, AND I<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> GET THE FIRST QUESTION. MR. KENNEDY, WHAT IS THE DEFINITION OF A SUBSET? UHH. YOU REALIZE IT IS THE FIRST WORD
IN YOUR READING? YEAH. I CIRCLED IT COVETED NOT KNOW
WHAT IT MEANT.
-- BECAUSE I DID NOT KNOW WHAT
IT MEANT.
DO YOU HAVE A DICTIONARY? THAT IS WHAT PEOPLE DO WHEN THEY
DON'T KNOW WHAT A WORD MEANS. I NEVER SHOWED UP UNPREPARED FOR
PROFESSOR ELIZABETH WARREN EVER AGAIN.
[CHEERING] SHE WAS THE TOUGHEST TEACHER ON CAMPUS BUT THE WAIT LIST FOR HER
CLASS WAS A MILE LONG.
SHE PUSHED US HARD, SHE BROUGHT OUT OUR BEST AND SHE BELIEVED IN US AND SHE BELIEVED IN THE LAW.
NOT AS AN ABSTRACTION, BUT AS A
LIVING FORCE WITH THE POWER TO
MAKE LIFE BETTER OR WORSE. SHE TAUGHT US IN THE SOCIETY FOR
WAGES HAD NOT BUDGED IN 40
YEARS. WHERE 2.5 MILLING CHILDREN ARE
HOMELESS. WHERE WE CAN EXPECT ONE IN THREE BLACK MEN TO GO TO PRISON. OUR LAWS HAVE HUMAN CONSEQUENCES. THAT FUELED A LOGICAL PROFESSOR TO TAKE ON THIS COUNTRY'S MOST
ENTRENCHED FINANCIAL INTEREST. BROUGHT MIDDLE CLASS CHAMPION
BACK TO A MESSAGE TO -- MASSACHUSETTS SENATOR. AND IT LET A FIRST-TERM SENATOR
BECOME OUR GOVERNMENT THAT
CHECK. A SEA OF POWER AND PRIVILEGE, AND ANCHOR FOR THE VOICELESS AND
THE DEMISE. SHE ASKS MORE FROM ALL THOSE
BECAUSE SHE BELIEVES DEEPLY IN
EACH OF US. THAT FAITH IN OUR COUNTRY AND
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE IS THE VERY
FOUNDATION OF OUR CREDIT PARTY.
-- DEMOCRATIC ALREADY.
IT ECHOES THROUGH THE ARENA TONIGHT AND EVERY CLASSROOM, LIVING ROOM, THAT SENATOR WARREN
HAS EVER TOUCHED. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, IT IS MY HONOR TO INTRODUCE TO YOU, YOUR SENATOR, MY SENATOR, OUR SENATOR
SENATOR ELIZABETH WARREN.
