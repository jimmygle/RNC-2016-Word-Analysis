<strong>Paul Feeney</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> MR. FEENEY: WOW. GOOD AFTERNOON
FELLOW DEMOCRATS. I AM A PROUD MEMBER OF THE INTERNATIONAL BROTHERHOOD OF ELECTRICAL WORKERS 2222 IN
AUSTIN, MASSACHUSETTS.
--<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> BOSTON MASSACHUSETTS. I COMMENT FROM THE LABOR
MOVEMENT, SO CAN I CALL YOU MY
BROTHERS AND SISTERS?
[APPLAUSE] IN THAT CASE, WE ARE AT A
CROSSROADS. EVEN JUST A MATTER OF MOMENTS,
WE WILL ENTER A NEW PHASE IN OUR PARTY, AND CHART A NEW COURSE
FOR THE FUTURE OF OUR COUNTRY. AS WE TURN THE PAGE, WE MUST BE
REFLECTIVE OF THIS PAST YEAR
WHEN WORKING PEOPLE ACROSS THIS COUNTRY JOIN WITH SENATOR BERNIE SANDERS TO REIGNITE A POLITICAL REVOLUTION IN THE UNITED STATES
OF AMERICA.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] BROTHERS AND SISTERS, BERNIE NOT
ONLY FOUGHT FOR PEOPLE, HE
EMPOWERED PEOPLE. TO MY BROTHERS AND SISTERS THAT
HAVE BEEN A PART OF THIS HISTORIC CAMPAIGN, I URGE YOU TO
STAY ENGAGED, STAY ACTIVE, STAY FIRED UP. BECAUSE WE HAVE SHOWN THIS COUNTRY THAT PEOPLE POWERED
POLITICS CAN NEVER BE DEFEATED.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THEY SAY THAT MOVEMENTS ARE MADE
UP OF THE THEY SERIES OF MOVEMENTS.
MY BROTHERS AND SISTERS, IT'S ONES LIKE THE ONE WE FIND
OURSELVES IN IN PHILADELPHIA, AS WE STAND ON THE VERGE OF
NOMINATING OUR CANDIDATES FOR
PRESIDENT. IT'S MOMENTS LIKE THE ONES WE
HAD LAST NIGHT WHEN BERNIE SIGNS FILLED THIS WHOLE AND WERE HELD
UP -- FILLED THIS HALL AND WERE
HELD UP NOT BY IT ONLY BERNIE SUPPORTERS, BUT BY HILLARY
SUPPORTERS TOO. WE SHOULD BE PROUD TO SHARE THIS
MOMENT TOGETHER, BUT TO FILL
THIS MOVEMENT TOGETHER.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] BERNIE'S CAMPAIGN CAME TOGETHER
AROUND A SHARED SET OF VALUES
AND IDEALS. VALUES AND IDEALS LIKE THE FIGHT FOR $15. LIKE THE FIGHT FOR UNIONS, AGAINST ECONOMIC INEQUALITY.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] THOSE ARE CENTRAL TENETS OF WHO WE ARE AS A PARTY. BUT ALL OF THOSE THINGS ARE
NOTHING MORE THAN WORDS ON PAPER
UNLESS WE DECIDE, AS BERNIE
ASKED US TO LAST NIGHT, TO JOIN TOGETHER AND SUPPORT HILLARY CLINTON IN  NOVEMBER FOR
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] MY BROTHERS AND SISTERS, MY
FELLOW DEMOCRATS, NOW IS THE
TIME TO STAND UP, TO RISE UP AND
IT SENDS A MESSAGE TO THE REST OF AMERICA THAT OUR PARTY IS
UNITED. OUR MOVEMENT IS A LIFE AND OUR REVOLUTION HAS JUST BEGUN.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] WITH THAT,I  PROBABLY RISE TO
SECOND THE NOMINATION TO SECOND
DEMOCRATIC BERNIE SANDERS FOR
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. THANK YOU, GOD BLESS YOU.
