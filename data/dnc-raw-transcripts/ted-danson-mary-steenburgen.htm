<p class='short_transcript'> >> I'VE BEEN BLESSED TO CALL
HILLARY CLINTON ONE OF MY CLOSEST FRIENDS SINCE 1978. THAT IS A WHOLE LOT OF LIGHT. HOW WILL I DESCRIBE HER? LOVES TO LAUGH,<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> ESPECIALLY AT
HERSELF.
WORLD-CLASS LISTENER. QUICK TO FORGIVE.
SENSITIVE. EMPATHETIC. LIKE HER MOTHER, IF SHE GETS
KNOCKED DOWN SEVEN TIMES, SHE
WILL GET OUT EIGHT. WHEN THAT IN ARKANSAS, A GROUP
OF US WENT BACK TO THE PLATE FOR
DESSERT. WE WERE SITTING ON THE KITCHEN
COUNTER AND BILL AND HILLARY
WERE TALKING ABOUT HEALTH CARE FOR CHILDREN AND AS THEY WERE
TALKING, I REMEMBER LOOKING AT
BILL AND THINKING, I WISH HE
COULD BECOME PRESIDENT SOMEDAY. THEN I LOOKED AT HILLARY AND I THOUGHT, WOULDN'T SAY SOMETHING TO OUR DAUGHTERS, TO OUR SONS, TO ALL THOSE PEOPLE WHOSE LIVES
I KNOW YOU COULD TOUCH, IF YOU BECAME PRESIDENT BECAUSE I KNOW YOU AND I KNOW YOU WILL NEVER STOP WORKING YOUR HEART OUT FOR
THEM. THAT WAS 38 YEARS AGO. IT SEEMED LIKE TOO MUCH TO DREAM
FOR. BUT TONIGHT, IT SEEMS VERY
POSSIBLE.

<strong>Unidentified Speaker</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> MY NAME IS HENRIETTA IVEY AND
I'M A DETROIT HOME CARE WORKER.
I'M A MOTHER OF FOUR AND A PROUD
MOTHER OF SEVEN. GRANDCHILDREN. I AM BLESSED TO DO THE<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> WORK I BELIEVE IN, KEEPING FAMILIES IN THEIR HOMES AND CARING FOR
PEOPLE IN NEED. EVEN AS I WORK MY FIGURE TO THE BONE, I DON'T ALWAYS FEEL THE SUPPORT I NEED FROM THE LEADERS
I'M SUPPOSED TO TRUST. WORK TWO JOBS AT MINIMUM WAGE
AND CAN BARELY MAKE ENDS MEET. I REMEMBER LOOKING AT MY BABY'S DAYS AS AN FIGHTING BACK TEARS
BECAUSE I ALWAYS TAUGHT THEM TO
DREAM BIG BUT I DID NOT ALWAYS
KNOW IF I WOULD BE ABLE TO LIVE THESE DREAMS. WHEN I FIRST MET HILLARY CLINTON, WE CONNECTED RIGHT AWAY
AND AS MOTHERS AND PEOPLE WHO LET LIFE -- LEAD LIVES OF SERVICE, I KNOW SHE WILL FIGHT
TO RAISE MINIMUM WAGE. IN MICHIGAN, WE ARE FIGHTING FOR 15.
[CHEERS] A $15 MINIMUM WAGE BECAUSE
NETWORKING AMERICAN FAMILY
SHOULD BE FORCED TO LIVE IN POVERTY.
[CHEERS] I SEE MYSELF IN HER AND I BELIEVE SHE SEES HERSELF AND ME.
[CHEERS] I BELIEVE HER STEADY HAND IN THE
OVAL OFFICE WILL HAVE PEOPLE LIKE ME READ EASIER -- BREATHE EASIER AND ACHIEVE MORE.
THAT MAKES THE SELECTION BIGGER THAN POLITICS. FOR ME AND ALL HOME CARE WORKERS
ACROSS THE NATION, AND MY FAMILY, THIS IS PERSONAL.
[CHEERS] I KNOW HILLARY CLINTON HAS ARE BACK AND WE WILL HAVE HERS. THANKS TO. THROUGHOUT THE BOOK -- GO OUT
AND VOTE NOVEMBER 8, AND GOD
BLESS YOU ALL.
