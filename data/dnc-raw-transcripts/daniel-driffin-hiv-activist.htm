<strong>Daniel Driffin</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> GOOD AFTERNOON. I LIVE IN ATLANTA, GEORGIA AND I SERVE AS THE COFOUNDER, TOGETHER
WITH MORE THAN ONE MILLION AMERICANS, I AM LIVING WITH HIV. WHEN<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> THE HIV-AIDS EPIDEMIC FIRST
EMERGED IN THE 1980'S, I WAS NOT
BORN YET. IT WAS A MYSTERIOUS VIRUS, THEN
A DEADLY ONE TOO. IT SEEMED TO BE PICKING OFF GAY
MEN ONE BY ONE, ESPECIALLY BLACK
AND LATINO. THE COMMUNITY SPOKE OUT TO THAT
POLICYMAKERS WOULD TAKE NOTICE. AND WHILE SUMMONING THEIR VOICES, HILLARY CLINTON
LISTENED. SHE ADVOCATED FOR THE INCREASED FUNDING FOR PREVENTION AND RESEARCH AS FIRST LADY. THEN WORKED TO INCREASE THE
FUNDING IN THE SENATE. SHE DESCENDED -- DEFENDED THE
RHYME WHITE CARE ACT AND
EXPANDED RESEARCHERS IN TESTING AND EDUCATION.
AS SECRETARY OF STATE, HILLARY
HELPED TO ENSURE THAT 6.7
MILLION PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD
GOT ACCESS TO ANTIRETROVIRAL THERAPY. AND SHE CRACKS DOWN ON THE STIGMA AROUND THE VIRUS AND
HELPED LIFT THE TRAVEL BAN WITH
THE HELP OF THE CONGRESSIONAL BLACK CAUCUS WHICH PRESENTED
PEOPLE WITH HIV-AIDS FROM -- WHICH PREVENTED PEOPLE WITH HIV-AIDS FROM ENTERING THE
COUNTRY. THE NUMBER OF NEW HIV AIDS
DIAGNOSES ARE ON THE DECLINE. IN THE U.S. BY NEARLY 20% OF THE LAST DECADE FOR CERTAIN POPULATIONS. WE KNOW HOW TO PREVENT THE VIRUS
NOW. WE KNOW HOW TO DIAGNOSE THE VIRUS NOW. WE KNOW HOW TO TREAT IT AND WE
KNOW HOW TO SUPPRESS IT. WE HAVE LEARNED ALL ABOUT WITHIN
MY LIFETIME. BUT STILL, THERE ARE MANY LIVING WITH HIV.
AND SO MANY OTHERS ARE. AND YOU ARE MOST AT RISK? YOUNG GAY BLACK MEN. MEN LIKE ME. IN FACT ONE INTO GAY BLACK MEN
-- ONE IN TWO GAY BLACK MEN WILL BE DIAGNOSED WITH HIV AND THE
LIFETIME IF CURRENT RATES CONTINUE.
IF WE HAVE ENOUGH DATA, I'M SURE
BLACK TRANSGENDER WOMEN ARE MORE
AT RISK TOO. WHAT CAN WE DO TO FIGHT HIV-AIDS TODAY?
WE INVEST IN RESEARCH AND EDUCATION.
EXPENSE TREATMENT AND
PREVENTION. AND WE ELECT HILLARY CLINTON.
[APPLAUSE] WITH HILLARY CLINTON AS OUR PRESIDENT, I BELIEVE THAT WE CAN
MEET OUR GOALS OF AN AIDS FREE GENERATION. AS AN ORGANIZER, AS A BLACK
MAN, AS A GAY MAN, AND AS A MAN
LIVING WITH HIV, I ASK YOU TO GO
GET TESTED, THEN GO IN THE. THANK YOU.
-- THEN GO AND VOTE.</span><span class='hidden-full-transcript-ellipses'>...</span></p><a href='#' class='hidden-full-transcript-link'><i class='icon-chevron-down'></i> <span class='link-show-full-text'>Show Full Text</span><i class='icon-chevron-up'></i> <span class='link-show-less-text'>Show Less Text</span></a>
