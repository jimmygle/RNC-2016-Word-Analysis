<strong>Kirsten Kavanaugh</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> AT THE AGE OF 24, I DEPLOYED
TO IRAQ. IT IS VERY RECEIVED DIRECT FIRE.
AFTER EACH ATTACK, EVERYTHING
WOULD FALL SILENT. AND THEN, I WOULD HEAR THE
SOUNDS<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> OF THE ARTILLERY BATTERY
RETURNING FIRE. AND THE QUICK REACTION FORCE
HELICOPTERS TAKING OFF IN THE
ENEMY DIRECTION. AS A YOUNG MARINE LIEUTENANT IN A NON-COMBAT POSITION, THESE UNITS, ALONG WITH SPECIAL OPERATIONS TEAMS AND GREEN INFANTRY BATTALIONS STATIONED WITH US -- MARINE INFANTRY
BETIMES STATION WITH US FOR THE
FIRST LINE OF DEFENSE.
I GAVE THEM MY LIFE.
I TRUSTED THEM AND MY COMMANDERS TO HAVE THE RIGHT STRATEGY. I TRUSTED THAT WE WERE INVITED EITHER -- EVEN WHEN THE ENEMY
CHOSE NOT TO. THAT TRUST STARTS AT THE TOP OF
THE CHAIN OF COMMAND. AND I TRUST HILLARY CLINTON TO
BE COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF.
[CHEERS] HE UNDERSTANDS THE IMPORTANCE OF A STRONG MILITARY AND DIPLOMACY. SHE KNOWS WE ARE STRONGER WHEN
WE WORK WITH OUR ALLIES TO KEEP
US SAFE. SHE HAS THE EXPERIENCE, TEMPERAMENT, AND STEADY HAND TO
LEAD. I DO NOT TRUST DONALD TRUMP.
[CHEERS] THE MILITARY IS DEFINED BY
DISCIPLINE. LEADERSHIP. INTEGRITY. THOSE ARE THE QUALITIES THAT DREW ME TO SERVE. AND THOSE OF THE VERY QUALITIES
THAT DONALD TRUMP LACKS.
[CHEERS] HE SUGGESTS ABANDONING OUR
CLOSEST ALLIES. HE PRAISES DICTATORS WHO KILLED
AMERICANS. HE SAYS WE SHOULD ALLOW MORE COUNTRIES TO GET NUCLEAR
WEAPONS. HIS RECKLESSNESS MEANS MORE
DEPLOYMENT FOR MY FRIENDS. MORE FAMILIES SEPARATED. AND MORE YOUNG HEROES NEVER
COMING HOME. WHEN HE SAYS HE WOULD EXPAND TORTURE, KILL CIVILIANS, OR
FORCE THE MILITARY TO COMMIT WAR CRIMES, HE IS DEFINING THE
VALUES -- DEFINED VIA THAT EVERY
SERVICE MEMBER IS TAUGHT ON DAY ONE.
-- DEFYING THE VALUES EVERY
MILITARY SERVICE MEMBER IS
TAUGHT ON DAY ONE.
HE DEVISED THE BUYERS WE RISK -- DEFIES THE VALUES WE RISK TO
DEFEND. THIS ELECTION IS NOT JUST ABOUT DONALD TRUMP'S JUDGMENT. IT IS ABOUT OUR OWN.
[CHEERS] OUR TROOPS, OUR NATION, OUR
WORLD CANNOT AFFORD FOR US TO
GET THIS WRONG.
[CHEERS] THANK YOU.

<strong>Leon E. Panetta</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> AT THIS HOUR, AND SOME VERY
DANGEROUS CORNERS OF THE WORLD, YOUNG AMERICANS ARE STANDING GUARD. OUR BRAVE MILITARY AND INTELLIGENCE PROFESSIONALS ARE<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> ON THE FRONT LINES FAR FROM HOME. RISKING THEIR LIVES FOR US, FOR OUR FREEDOM, OUR WAY OF LIFE. THE PRESIDENT, A COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF, HAS NO GREATER RESPONSIBILITY, NO GREATER RESPONSIBILITY THAN THE
DECISION TO SEND OUR TROOPS INTO
HARM'S WAY.
[CHEERS] I HAVE WORKED ALONGSIDE
NON-PRESIDENTS. REPUBLICAN AND DEMOCRAT. ALL EXPERIENCED, ALL BELIEVING
IN THE U.S. ROLE IN WORLD
LEADERSHIP. I CAN PAY THIS, THAT IN THIS ELECTION, THERE IS ONLY ONE
CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT WHO HAS
THE EXPERIENCE, THE TEMPERAMENT
AND THE JUDGMENT TO BE COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF AND THAT IS
HILLARY CLINTON.
[CHEERS] THIS IS NO TIME, THIS IS NO TIME TO GAMBLE WITH OUR FUTURE. AMERICA FACES FLASHPOINTS AND THREATS FROM AROUND THE GLOBE. WE NEED A PRESIDENT WHO IS STRONG AND SMART ENCOURAGES, WHO ENTERS THE OVAL OFFICE WITH THE RESPECT OF THE GENERALS AND
ADMIRALS WHO LEAD THE MILITARY. WITH THE CONFIDENCE OF DIPLOMATS WHO REPRESENT AMERICA AND WITH
THE TRUST OF OUR TROOPS WHO KNOW
THAT SHE WILL ALWAYS HAVE THEIR BACK.
[CHEERS] THAT PRESIDENT IS HILLARY CLINTON.
[CHEERS] DURING MY TIME AS CIA DIRECTOR, AND SECRETARY OF DEFENSE,
HILLARY WAS A STRONG SUPPORTER OF OUR EFFORTS TO PROTECT OUR HOMELAND. TO DECIMATE AL QAEDA AND TO BRING OSAMA BIN LADEN TO
JUSTICE.
[CHEERS] AND THE TOUGH DECISIONS, TO GO
AFTER BIN LADEN, LONG MEETINGS
IN THE WHITE HOUSE. WE DELAYED THAT FATEFUL DECISION
. I PRESENTED THE INTELLIGENCE TO
THE PRESIDENT AND TO OTHERS
WEIGHING OUT THE RISKS OF THE
OPERATION. AND WHEN THE PRESIDENT WENT
AROUND THE TABLE, TO OUR COUNTRY. SECURITY LEADERSHIP, THERE WERE CONCERNS. BUT HILLARY WAS CLEAR. WE HAVE TO GO AFTER BIN LADEN.
[CHEERS] AND OUR SPECIAL OPERATIONS FORCES, GOD BLESS THEM, THEY JUST THAT. AND THEY SENT A CLEAR MESSAGE TO THE WORLD, NO ONE ATTACKED THE
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA AND
GETS AWAY WITH IT.
[CHEERS] HILLARY IS JUST AS DETERMINED TO
DEFEAT THOSE WHO THREATEN US TODAY. ISIS, AL QAEDA, BOKO HARAM, AL-SHABAAB, TERRORISTS WHO
PERVERT THE TEACHINGS OF ISLAM
TO KILL INNOCENT PEOPLE GOING
ABOUT THEIR DAILY LIVES. PEOPLE TRAVELING THROUGH
AIRPORTS IN BRUSSELS AND THE
SCANDAL. FAMILIES CELEBRATING ON THE BEACHFRONT IN FRANCE. AND JUST THIS WEEK, AN 85-YEAR-OLD PRIEST WHOSE THROAT
WAS SLIT BY TERRORISTS WHO
STORMED HIS CHURCH DURING MASS. THESE MURDERERS MUST BE STOPPED.
[CHEERS] HILLARY CLINTON IS THE ONLY CANDIDATE WHO HAS LAID OUT A COMPREHENSIVE FAN -- PLAN TO
DEFEAT AND DESTROY ISIS AND KEEP AMERICA SAFE. SHE IS SMART, PRINCIPAL, SHE IS TOUGH AND SHE IS READY.
[CHEERS] HILLARY CLINTON IS THE SINGLE MOST EXPERIENCED AND PREPARE A PERSON WHO HAS EVER RUN FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.
[CHEERS] MEANWHILE, DONALD TRUMP SAYS HE
GETS HIS FOREIGN-POLICY EXPERIENCE FROM WATCHING TV AND
RUNNING THE MISS UNIVERSE PAGEANT. IF ONLY IT WERE FUNNY, BUT IT IS DEADLY SERIOUS. DONALD TRUMP ASKS OUR TROOPS TO
COMMIT WAR CRIMES, ENDORSES TORTURE, BURNT OUR ALLIES FROM
EUROPE TO ASIA AND SUGGESTS THAT COUNTRIES HAVE NUCLEAR WEAPONS
AND HE PRAISES DICTATORS FROM SADDAM HUSSEIN TO VLADIMIR
PUTIN. TODAY, ONLY TODAY, LET ME POINT
OUT SOMETHING THAT JUST HAPPENED TODAY. DONALD TRUMP TODAY ONCE AGAIN
TOOK RUSSIA'S SIDE. HE ASKED THE RUSSIANS TO INTERFERE IN AMERICAN POLITICS. THINK ABOUT THAT.
>> BOO!
>> THINK ABOUT THAT FOR A
MOMENT. DONALD TRUMP WHO WAS THE
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES IS ASKING ONE OF OUR ADVERSARIES
TO ENGAGE IN HACKING AND
INTELLIGENT EFFORTS AGAINST THE
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA TO
AFFECT AN ELECTION.
>> BOO!
>> AS SOMEONE WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PROTECTING OUR NATION FROM
CYBER ATTACKS, IT IS
INCONCEIVABLE TO ME THAT ANY PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE WOULD BE
THAT IRRESPONSIBLE. I SAY THIS OUT OF THE FIRM CONCERN FOR THE FUTURE OF MY
CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN, DONALD TRUMP CANNOT BECOME COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF.
[CHEERS] IN AN UNSTABLE WORLD, WE CANNOT
AFFORD UNSTABLE LEADERSHIP. WE CANNOT AFFORD SOMEONE WHO
BELIEVES AMERICA SHOULD WITHDRAW
FROM THE WORLD, THREATENS OUR INTERNATIONAL TREATIES AND
VIOLATES OUR MORAL PRINCIPLES. WE CANNOT AFFORD AN ERRATIC
FINGER ON THE NUCLEAR WEAPONS.
[CHEERS] THIS IS NO TIME TO ROLL THE DICE
AND TO GAMBLE WITH AMERICA'S
NATIONAL SECURITY OR WITH THE
AMERICAN DREAM. NO DOUBT. I'VE LIVED THAT AMERICAN DREAM. MY PARENTS WERE IMMIGRANTS OR MENTALLY.
-- ITALY.
THEY CAME FROM ELLIS ISLAND. THEY MADE THEIR WAY TO CALIFORNIA. THEY OPENED A RESTAURANT. I CAN STILL REMEMBER STANDING ON THE CHAIR IN THE BACK OF THAT RESTAURANT WASHING GLASSES. NEVER COULD MY -- COULD I DO
AGREE THAT I WOULD BECOME
SECRETARY OF DEFENSE OF THE MOST
POWERFUL MILITARY IN THE WORLD.
[CHEERS] THE AMERICAN DREAM --
>> USA USA USA. USA! USA! USA!
>> THE AMERICAN DREAM. THE AMERICAN DREAM THAT WE'VE ALL BEEN A PART OF HAS BEEN
APPENDED IN EVERY GENERATION BY
THE BRAVE MEN AND WOMEN WILLING
TO FIGHT AND DIE FOR AMERICA. THEY ARE OUR GREATEST NATIONAL
TREASURES.
[CHEERS] AND THEY DESERVE A SERIOUS COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF. IF WE CARE ABOUT THEM, IF WE
CARE ABOUT OUR SECURITY HIM IF
WE CARE ABOUT OUR FREEDOMS, IF
WE CARE ABOUT THE AMERICAN
DREAM, THERE IS ONLY ONE CHOICE, HILLARY CLINTON FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.
[CHEERS] GOD BLESS YOU AND GOD BLESS OUR NATION.

<strong>Jill Biden</strong>

OVER THE PAST EIGHT YEARS,
AMERICA HAS GOTTEN TO KNOW THE JOE BIDEN THAT I KNOW AND LOVE. HE IS HONEST AND STRONG,
PRINCIPLED AND COMPASSIONATE, HE WAS AUTHENTIC LONG BEFORE IT
BECAME A BUZZWORD IN POLITICS.
HE UNDERSTANDS THAT WORKING PEOPLE ARE THE BACKBONE OF THIS
GREAT NATION. AND HE HAS TREMENDOUS EMPATHY
FOR THOSE IN NEED. HE KNOWS, AS I DO, THAT EDUCATION IS THE GREAT EQUALIZER
AND THAT COMMUNITY COLLEGES ARE
AMERICA'S BEST-KEPT SECRET. AND HE BELIEVES, AS I DO, THAT WE HAVE A SPECIAL OBLIGATION TO
OUR MILITARY AND THEIR FAMILIES. HE HAS A DEEP COMMITMENT TO
JUSTICE AND HE HAS BEEN HIS ENTIRE CAREER STANDING UP TO THE
ABUSE OF POWER. HE KNOWS AT ITS BEST, POLITICS IS ALWAYS A MATTER OF THE HEART. AND HE REMAINS TODAY EVEN AFTER ALL HE HAS BEEN THERE -- THROUGH, THE MOST OPTIMISTIC
PERSON I KNOW.
[CHEERS] HE LOVES HIS FAMILY, HE LOVES THIS COUNTRY, HE IS YOUR VICE PRESIDENT AND MY HUSBAND, JOE BIDEN.
