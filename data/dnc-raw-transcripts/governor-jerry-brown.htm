<strong>Jerry Brown Jr.</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> THANK YOU.
[CHEERS] THANK YOU. AS WE JUST SAW --
[CHEERS] I ONLY HAVE FIVE MINUTES. I HAVE TO GET GOING. AS WE JUST SAW, CLIMATE CHANGE
IS UNLIKE ANY<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> OTHER THREAT. IT IS OVERARCHING. AFFECT THE ENTIRE EARTH AND ALL LIVING THINGS. IT IS SLOW. IT CAN RECENT IRREVERSIBLE TIPPING POINT AND THE VAST
UNKNOWN SPIRIT COMBATING CLIMATE
CHANGE, THE EXISTENTIAL THREAT
OF OUR TIME WILL TAKE A ROAD EFFORTS ON THE PART OF MANY
PEOPLE IN MANY NATIONS. MAKE NO MISTAKE, CLIMATE CHANGE
IS REAL. THE VAST MAJORITY OF WORLD LEADERS AND CLIMATE SCIENTISTS, LIKE THOSE AT NASA AND THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE, AND BECOME ALL MOST ANYONE WHO
CHOOSES TO THINK, BELIEVE IN THE SCIENCE CLIMATE CHANGE AND SEE
THE MORAL IMPERATIVE TO TAKE
ACTION.
[CHEERS] BUT YOU WOULD NOT KNOW IT BY
LISTENING TO DONALD TRUMP. LASTLY, AT THE REPUBLICAN CONVENTION, FOR 76 LONG AND PAINFUL MINUTES, TRUMP CONJURED
UP A HOST OF DARK THREATS, BUT
NEVER ONCE MENTIONED THE WORD CLIMATE CHANGE OR GLOBAL
WARMING.
WHAT DO YOU EXPECT? DONALD TRUMP REPRESENTED PARTY
WITH OFFICIALS WHO HAVE BANNED
STATE EMPLOYEES FROM EVEN USING
THOSE WORDS IN FLORIDA AND WHO
ELSE KNOWS WHERE ELSE. DONALD TRUMP SAYS GLOBAL WARMING IS A HOAX. I SAID, TRUMP IS A FRAUD.
[CHEERS] TRUMP SAYS THERE IS NO -- CALIFORNIA. I SAID DONALD TRUMP LIES.
[CHEERS] IT IS NOT SURPRISING THAT DONALD
TRUMP CHOSE AS HIS RUNNING MATE
A MAN WHO DENIES THERE IS SUCH A
THING AS EVOLUTION. REALLY? IN AMERICAN HISTORY, HAVE TWO PARTIES TO BURST SO PROFOUNDLY. EVEN THE KNOW NOTHINGS, ANTI-IMMIGRANT PARTY OF THE
AGING HUNDREDS -- 1850'S DID NOT
STRAY AS FAR INTO SHEER IGNORANCE AND DARK FANTASY AS
HAVE THE REPUBLICAN AND A LEADER
DONALD TRUMP.
[CHEERS] OUR CANDIDATE, HILLARY CLINTON COULD NOT BE MORE DIFFERENT. WHILE TRUMP TALKS AND TALKS AND TALKS, HILLARY JUST UPGRADED SHE BITES FOR US ON THE BIG ISSUES. AS SECRETARY OF STATE, SHE PAVED
THE WAY FOR THE HISTORIC PARIS
CLIMATE AGREEMENT, AN AGREEMENT WITH 200 NATIONS, INCLUDING
CHINA AND INDIA ENTHUSIASTICALLY EMBRACING IT. AND MR. TRUMP, HE SAYS THE WORLD BE DAMNED. I'M TURNED IT UP. HILLARY IS THE ONE WHO LAUNCHED
THE CLIMATE AND CLEAN AIR
COALITION.
A GROUP OF NATIONS TAKING ACTION
TO REDUCE BLACK CARBON AND OTHER
SUPER CLIMATE POLLUTANTS WHICH
CAUSED SEVERE HEART AND LUNG
DAMAGE. AND FOR HER BIRTHDAY IN OFFICE, PRESIDENT HILLARY CLINTON WILL
DO WHAT IS NEEDED TO COMBAT CLIMATE CHANGE AND LEAD THE CLEAN ENERGY REVOLUTION.
AND YES, WE DO NEED A
REVOLUTION.
[CHEERS] AND WE WILL GET ONE. WE KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT THAT IN CALIFORNIA.
[CHEERS] WE CAPS ON PANELS, CLEAN OMISSIONS, AND ATTACKS ARE
COMMON. WE'RE PROVEN WITH THE TOUGHEST CLIMATE LAWS ON THE COUNTRY, OUR ECONOMY IS GROWING FASTER THAN ALMOST ANY NATION IN THE WHOLE WORLD.
[CHEERS] MR. TRUMP, AND THOSE WHO LIVED
IN CLIMATE DENIAL SAY OTHERWISE. THEY TELL US WE HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN THE ECONOMY AND SAVING THE PLANET. DONALD TRUMP AND THE CLIMATE
DENIERS ARE DEAD WRONG. DANGEROUSLY WRONG. WHAT AMERICA NEEDS TODAY ARE NOT DENIERS, THAT LEADERS. NOT THE VISION, A COMMON PURPOSE. NOT BOMBAST, BUT BOLD ACTION. THAT IS WHY WE NEED HILLARY. THAT IS WHY THE AMERICAN PEOPLE
WHO CHOOSE HER AS THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. THANK YOU.
