<strong>Unidentified Speaker</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> GOOD EVENING. MY BROTHERS AND SISTERS. I COME BEFORE YOU TONIGHT AS A PREACHER, THE SON OF A PREACHER. A PREACHER IMMERSED IN THE
MOVEMENT AT FIVE<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> YEARS OLD. I DON'T COME TONIGHT
REPRESENTING ANY ORGANIZATION,
BUT I COME TO TALK ABOUT FAITH
AND MORALITY. I'M A PREACHER AND I'M A
THEOLOGICALLY CONSERVATIVE LIBERAL EVANGELICAL PHYSICIST.
[CHEERS] I KNOW IT MAY SOUND STRANGE, BUT
I'M A CONSERVATIVE BECAUSE I
WORKED TO CONSERVE A DIVINE TRADITION THAT TEACHES US TO DO JUSTICE, LOVE MERCY AND WALK
HUMBLY WITH OUR GOD.
[CHEERS] I'VE HAS A PLAY BRIDGE -- PRIVILEGE OF WALKING WITH MANY
INFLUENTIAL. AS WE ARE WORKING TOGETHER IN THE REVIVAL AND CALLING FOR A REVOLUTION OF VALUES, AS WE
TRAVEL THE COUNTRY AND SEE
THINGS, THAT IS WHY I'M SO
CONCERNED ABOUT THOSE THAT FACE SO MUCH, ABOUT WHAT GOD SAYS SO
LITTLE WHILE SAYING SO LITTLE ABOUT WHAT GOD SAYS SO MUCH.
[CHEERS] IN MY HEART, I'M TROUBLED. AND I'M WORRIED ABOUT THE WAY
THEY DO CYNICALLY USED BY SOME TO SERVE HATE, FEAR, RACISM AND
GREED. WE NEED TO KEEP THE BAR OF THE
SCRIPTURES. WE NEED TO LISTEN TO THE AGENT COURSE IN WHICH DEED GOES ON TO DO.
THE PROPHET ISAIAH CRIES OUT, WHAT I'M INTERESTED IN, THE NATION, PAY PEOPLE WHAT THEY
DESERVE.
[CHEERS] SHARE YOUR FOOD WITH THE HUNGRY. DO THIS AND THEN YOUR NATION SHALL BE CALLED A REPAIRER OF
THE BREACH.
[CHEERS] JESUS, A BROWN SKINNED PALESTINIAN JEW CALLED US TO
PREACH GOOD NEWS TO THE POOR, THE BROKEN AND THE BRAISED IN ALL THOSE WHO ARE MADE TO FEEL
ACCEPTED.
OUR CONSTITUTION CALLS US TO
COMMIT OUR GOVERNMENT TO
ESTABLISH JUSTICE, TO PROMOTE
THE GENERAL WELFARE, TO PROVIDE
FOR THE COMMON DEFENSE AND TO ENSURE DOMESTIC TRANQUILITY.
[CHEERS] NOW, TO BE TRUE, WE'VE NEVER LIVED THIS VISION PERFECTLY. BUT THIS OUGHT TO BE THE GOAL AT THE HEART OF OUR DEMOCRACY. AND WHEN RELIGION IS USED TO CAMOUFLAGE MEANNESS, WE KNOW
THAT WE HAVE A HARD PROBLEM IN AMERICA -- HEART PROBLEM IN
AMERICA.
[CHEERS] THERE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN FORCES THAT WANT TO HARDEN AND EVEN
STOP THE HEART OF DEMOCRACY. THERE HAVE ALSO ALWAYS BEEN PEOPLE WHO STOOD TOGETHER TO A STIR WHAT SISTER DOROTHY GAVE
CALLED THE REVOLUTION OF THE HEART AND WHAT DR. KING CALLED A
RADICAL REVOLUTION OF VALUES.
[CHEERS] I SAY TO YOU TONIGHT, SOME ISSUES ARE NOT LEFT VERSUS RIGHT
OR LIBERALS VERSUS
CONSERVATIVES, THEY ARE RIGHT VERSUS WRONG. WE NEED TO EMBRACE OUR DEEPEST MORAL VALUES AND PUSH FOR A REVIVAL AT THE HEART OF OUR DEMOCRACY. WHEN WE FIGHT, TO REINSTATE THE POWER OF THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT.
[CHEERS] AND WE BREAK THE NULLIFICATION OF THE CURRENT CONGRESS. WE ESPECIALLY NOTE THAT WHEN WE
DO THAT, WE ARE REVIVING THE
HEART OF OUR DEMOCRACY.
[CHEERS] WHEN WE FIGHT FOR 15 AND A UNION.
[CHEERS] AND UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE AND PUBLIC EDUCATION AND IMMIGRANT RIGHTS, AND LGBTQT WRITES.
[CHEERS]
-- RIGHTS.
[CHEERS] WE ARE REVIVING THE HEART OF OUR
DEMOCRACY.
[CHEERS] WHEN WE DEVELOP TAX AND TRADE
POLICIES THAT NO LONGER FUNNEL
OUR PROSPERITY TO THE WEALTHY FEW, WE ARE REVIVING THE HEART
OF OUR DEMOCRACY.
[CHEERS] WHEN WE HEAR THE LEGITIMATE DISCONNECT -- DISCONTENT OF
BLACK LIVES MATTER AND BECOME TOGETHER -- WE COME TOGETHER TO
RENEW JUSTICE IN OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM, WE ARE EMBRACING
OUR DEEPEST MORAL VALUES AND
REVIVING THE HEART OF OUR
DEMOCRACY.
[CHEERS] WHEN WE LOVE THE JEWISH CHILD
AND THE PALESTINIAN CHILD.
[CHEERS] THE MUSLIM AND THE CHRISTIAN AND THE HINDU AND THE BUDDHIST AND THOSE WHO HAVE NO FAITH BUT THEY LOVE THIS NATION.
[CHEERS] WE ARE REVIVING THE HEART OF OUR DEMOCRACY. WHEN WE FIGHT FOR PEACE AND WHEN
WE RESIST THE PROLIFERATION OF
MILITARY STYLE WEAPONS ON OUR
STREET.
[CHEERS] AND WHEN WE STAND AGAINST THE ANTI-DEMOCRATIC STRONGHOLD OF THE NRA, WE ARE REVIVING THE
HEART OF OUR DEMOCRACY.
[CHEERS] IN TIMES LIKE THESE, WE HAVE TO
MAKE SOME DECISIONS AND I MIGHT
NOT KNOW -- NORMALLY BE HERE AS
A PREACHER IN INDIVIDUAL, BUT
WHEN I HEAR HILLARY'S VOICE AND
HER POSITIONS, I HEAR AND I KNOW
THAT SHE IS WORKING TO EMBRACE OUR DEEPEST MORAL VALUES AND WE
SHOULD EMBRACE HER.
[CHEERS] BUT LET ME BE CLEAR, LET ME BE CLEAR, SHE, NOR ANY PERSON CAN
DO IT ALONE. THE WATCHWORD OF THE DEMOCRACY
IN THE WATCHWORD OF FAITH IS WE. THE HEART OF OUR DEMOCRACY IS ON THE LINE THIS  NOVEMBER AND BEYOND.
[CHEERS] MY FRIENDS, THEY TELL ME THAT
WHEN THE HEART IS IN DANGER,
SOMEBODY HAS TO CALL AN
EMERGENCY CODE. AND SOMEBODY WITH A GOOD HEART
WILL BRING A DEFIBRILLATOR TO
WORK ON THE BAD HEART.
[CHEERS] BECAUSE IT IS POSSIBLE TO SHOCK ABOUT HEART AND REVIVED THE POLLS. IN THE SEASON, WHEN SOMEONE TO HARDEN AND STOP THE HEART OF OUR DEMOCRACY, WE ARE BEING CALLED
LIKE OUR POOR MOTHERS AND FATHERS TO BE THE MORAL
DEFIBRILLATOR OF OUR TIME.
[CHEERS] WE MUST SHOCK THIS NATION WITH
THE POWER OF LOVE. WE MUST SHOCK THIS NATION WITH THE POWER OF MERCY.
WE MUST SHOCK THIS NATION AND FIGHT FOR JUSTICE FOR ALL. WE CAN'T GIVE UP ON THE HEART OF OUR DEMOCRACY, NOT NOW, NOT EVER!
[CHEERS] AND SO, AND SO I STOP BY HERE TONIGHT TO ASK, IS THERE A HEART
IN THIS HOUSE?
[CHEERS] IS THERE A HEART IN AMERICA?
[CHEERS] IS THERE SOMEBODY THAT HAS A
HEART FOR THE POOR? AND A FOR THE VULNERABLE?
[CHEERS] THEN STAND UP.
BOAT TOGETHER.
-- VOTE TOGETHER.
ORGANIZE TOGETHER.
[CHEERS] FIGHT FOR THE HEART OF THIS
NATION.
[CHEERS] WHILE WE ARE FIGHTING, REVIVE US AGAIN. LEAD WITH LOVE. MAY EACH SOUL BE REKINDLED. WITH FIRE FROM ABOVE. HALLELUJAH. FIND THE GLORY.
