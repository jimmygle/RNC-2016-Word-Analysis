<strong>Lily Eskelsen Garcia</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> WOW.
[SPEAKING SPANISH] I AM HERE BECAUSE I HAVE THE HONOR TO BE REPRESENTING THE 3 MILLION EDUCATORS THAT FORM THE UNION OF THE NATIONAL EDUCATION<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> ASSOCIATION. MY STORY IS NOT DIFFERENT FROM MY STUDENTS STORY. MY MOM IS AN IMMIGRANT AND MY
DAD SERVED IN THE ARMY. MY PARENTS WORKED HARD SO THEIR KIDS COULD HAVE A CHANCE TO GET AHEAD AND THEY WERE SO PROUD OF ME WHEN I BECAME A TEACHER. TODAY, TOO MANY STUDENTS IN OUR
CLASSROOMS FEEL LIKE THEY WILL
NOT GET THE SAME CHANCE I GOT, ESPECIALLY THOSE FROM IMMIGRANT FAMILIES. THEY TELL US THEY ARE AFRAID
THAT THEIR PARENTS MIGHT BE TAKEN AWAY, THAT THEY MIGHT BE DEPORTED FOR NOT HAVING THE RIGHT PIECE OF PAPER. HILLARY CLINTON BELIEVES IN KEEPING FAMILIES TOGETHER. SHE BELIEVES IN OUR DREAMERS. SHE BELIEVES THAT EDUCATORS
SHOULD BE FOCUSED ON EDUCATION, NOT DEPORTATION. DONALD TRUMP SEES THINGS DIFFERENTLY. MY MOM SAYS IF YOU CANNOT SAY
SOMETHING NICE ABOUT SOMEBODY, IT YOU SHOULD AT LEAST MAKE IT
FUNNY. I CANNOT MAKE THIS FUNNY. DONALD TRUMP SEES IMMIGRANTS AS CRIMINALS, DRUG DEALERS
,RAPISTS? HE SAYS HE WOULD ROUND UP
FAMILIES AND UP THEM AND BUILD A WALL -- DEPART THEM AND BUILD THE WALL. WE ARE BETTER THAN THAT. HILLARY CLINTON DOES NOT WANT TO
DIVIDE PEOPLE WITH WALLS OR
HATE. SHE WANTS TO BUILD BRIDGES TO A
BETTER FUTURE FOR ALL OF US. THAT IS WHY AMERICA'S EDUCATORS
ARE WITH HER AND WHY WE WILL DO EVERYTHING IN OUR POWER TO BUILD A BRIDGE TO A FUTURE WHERE HILLARY CLINTON IS THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. GRACIAS.

<strong>Mary Kay Henry</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> HELLO, SISTERS AND BROTHERS.
I AM MARY KAY HENRY AND I AM
PROUD TO STAND HERE ON BEHALF OF
2 MILLION MEMBERS OF SERVICE EMPLOYERS -- SERVICE EMPLOYEES
INTERNATIONAL<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> UNION. AND THE MILLIONS MORE WHO ARE FIGHTING FOR A UNION. OUR MOVEMENT WILL BE AN
UNSTOPPABLE FORCE IN THE
SELECTION BECAUSE THE STAKES
COULD NOT BE HIGHER. WE NEED A PRESIDENT WHO WANTS TO WAYS -- RAISE WAGES IN THIS COUNTRY, NOT ONE THAT SAYS WAGES ARE TOO HIGH AND THERE SHOULD
NOT BE A FEDERAL MINIMUM WAGE. THAT IS WHY WE ARE WORKING TO ELECT HILLARY CLINTON AND
CHAMPIONS UP AND DOWN THE BALLOT
WHO WILL RAISE WAGES AND HEALTH WORKERS JOINED TOGETHER IN UNIONS. HILLARY HAS SPENT TIME WITH WORKERS WHO CARE FOR CHILDREN AND OUR SENIORS. LISBETH HAS BEEN A HOMECARE PROVIDER FOR 40 YEARS. BUT SHE HAS TO RELY ON FOOD STAMPS AND MEDICAID JUST TO MAKE ENDS MEET. HILLARY CLINTON KNOWS THAT IS WRONG AND THAT IS WHY HILLARY CLINTON IS READY TO RAISE WAGES
FOR HOMECARE PROVIDERS AND CHILDCARE PROVIDERS AND ENSURE
THEY HAVE A STRONG VOICE IN QUALITY CARE. LINKED TO WINNING RACIAL JUSTICE, ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE AND IMMIGRANT JUSTICE. WE MUST ELECT HILLARY CLINTON
AND THE CHAMPIONS LIKE HER WERE
GOING TO PUT FAMILIES FIRST AND STOP THE CANDIDATE OF HATRED AND GREED. BROTHERS AND SISTERS, I BELIEVE THAT WE CAN WIN. YOU?
[CHEERING] REPEAT AFTER ME. I BELIEVE THAT WE CAN WIN!</span><span class='hidden-full-transcript-ellipses'>...</span></p><a href='#' class='hidden-full-transcript-link'><i class='icon-chevron-down'></i> <span class='link-show-full-text'>Show Full Text</span><i class='icon-chevron-up'></i> <span class='link-show-less-text'>Show Less Text</span></a>
