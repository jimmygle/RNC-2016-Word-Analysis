<strong>Martin J. O'Malley</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> MARTIN O'MALLEY: THANK YOU.
[CHEERS] MY FELLOW AMERICANS. MY FELLOW AMERICANS, PRESIDENT
OF THE UNITED STATES IS THE
TOUGHEST JOB IN THE WORLD. I COME<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> HERE BEFORE YOU AS A MAN
WHO KNOWS HILLARY CLINTON WELL. I HAVE WORKED ALONGSIDE HER AND
I HAVE COMPETED AGAINST HER, AND
I'M HERE TO TELL YOU HILLARY CLINTON IS AS TOUGH AS THEY
COME.
[CHEERS] SHE WILL STAND UP TO ISIS. SHE WILL STAND UP TO THE
RUSSIANS. AND WITH TIM KAINE AT HER SIDE
SHE WILL NEVER STOP FIGHTING FOR
OUR CHILDREN AND OUR FAMILIES
BECAUSE HILLARY CLINTON KNOWS
WHEN OUR FAMILIES ARE STRONG, AMERICA IS STRONG.
[CHEERS] NOW DONALD TRUMP, HE'S A
DIFFERENT STORY. HE WILL NOT FIGHT FOR US. HE FEEDS OFF OF ECONOMIC FEARS
AND FAILURES. STARS OF FALSE DIVISIONS AND
ANCIENT HATE. TURNS ANGER INTO A POLITICAL WEAPON. BUT MY FRIENDS, ANGER NEVER FED
A HUNGRY CHILD, DID IT? ANCHOR NEVER PROTECTED A FAMILY'S HOME OR SEND A KID TO
COLLEGE. ANGER NEVER BUILT A GREAT REPUBLIC.
I SAY TO HELL WITT TRUMP'S NIGHTMARE. WE BELIEVE IN THE AMERICAN
DREAM. WE BELIEVE, AS HILLARY CLINTON BELIEVES, THAT NO AMERICAN
FAMILY WHO WORKS HARD SHOULD HAVE TO RAISE THEIR CHILDREN IN POVERTY. DONALD TRUMP ON THE OTHER HAND
HAS ACTUALLY SAID, "WAGES ARE TOO HIGH." WAGES ARE TOO HIGH? REALLY, DONALD? I WILL TELL YOU WHAT IS TOO
HIGH. COLLEGE TUITION IS TOO HIGH.
[CHEERS] I WILL TELL YOU WHAT IS TOO
HIGH. THE COST OF CHILDCARE, THAT IS
TOO HIGH.
[CHEERS] THE NUMBER OF AMERICAN CHILDREN WHO LIVE IN POVERTY, THAT IS TOO
HIGH. DONALD TRUMP'S OPINION OF
HIMSELF --
[LAUGHTER] THAT IS WAY TOO HIGH.
[CHEERS] ACTUALLY DONALD, AMERICAN WAGES
IN FACT ARE TOO LOW. OUR ECONOMY ISN'T MONEY, DID HIS
PEOPLE. IT IS ALL OF OUR PEOPLE. AND HILLARY CLINTON IN TIM KAINE
WILL FIGHT TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERY FAMILY WHO IS WILLING TO
WORK HARD CAN ACTUALLY GET AHEAD
AGAIN IN AMERICA.
[CHEERS] ON CLIMATE CHANGE, LIKE YOU AND ME, AND IN FACT LIKE OUR
CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN,
HILLARY CLINTON BELIEVES IN
SCIENCE. SHE UNDERSTANDS THAT CLIMATE
CHANGE IS NOT ONLY A REAL THREAT, IT IS ALSO THE GREATEST
JOB CREATION OPPORTUNITY TO COME
TO THE UNITED STATES IN 100
YEARS. NOW DONALD TRUMP ON THE OTHER HAND DOES NOT BELIEVE IN
SCIENCE. HE SAYS, AND AGAIN I QUOTE, "THE CONCEPT OF GLOBAL WARMING WAS CREATED BY AND FOR THE CHINESE." I WILL TELL YOU WHAT. IF THE CHINESE WERE REALLY
CAPABLE OF DESIGNING SOME KIND
OF DIABOLICAL FARCE TO HURT AMERICA, THEY WERE NOT INVENT GLOBAL WARMING.
THEY WOULD INVENT DONALD TRUMP.
[CHEERS] THIS MUCH WE KNOW FOR SURE, DONALD TRUMP HAS BEEN A BULLY
HIS WHOLE LIFE. HERE IS WHAT I LEARNED IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL ON THE
PLAYGROUND. BULLIES ARE REALLY JUST COWARDS
IN DISGUISE. THE AMERICA WE LOVE DOES NOT
ENGAGE IN TORTURE. THE AMERICA WE LOVE DOES NOT BUILD WALLS AND SHAMEFUL FOR-PROFIT PRISONS. THE AMERICA WE LOVE DOES NOT
LOCK UP WOMEN AND CHILDREN IN
DISGRACEFUL IMMIGRANT DETENTION
CAMPS.
[CHEERS] UNLIKE THAT IMMIGRANT-BASHING CARNIVAL BARKER DONALD TRUMP,
HILLARY CLINTON UNDERSTANDS THE
ENDURING SYMBOL OF UNITED STATES
OF AMERICA IS NOT OF OUR WIRE FENCE, IT IS THE STATUE OF
LIBERTY.
[CHEERS] AND SO MY FELLOW DEMOCRATS, ANGER AND FEAR HAD THEIR MOMENT LAST WEEK. BUT NOW IT IS OUR TIME.
TIME TO STAND UP FOR EACH OTHER,
STAND UP FOR OUR SHARED PROMISE, STAND UP FOR THE GOODNESS AND THE HOPE IN EVERY AMERICAN
HEART. IT IS TIME TO PUT A BULLY RACIST
IN HIS PLACE AND A TOUGH WOMAN
IN HERS.
THE WHITE HOUSE. HILLARY CLINTON. TIM KAINE. STRONGER TOGETHER. THE COUNTRY WE CARRY IN OUR HEARTS IS WAITING.
[CHEERS]</span><span class='hidden-full-transcript-ellipses'>...</span></p><a href='#' class='hidden-full-transcript-link'><i class='icon-chevron-down'></i> <span class='link-show-full-text'>Show Full Text</span><i class='icon-chevron-up'></i> <span class='link-show-less-text'>Show Less Text</span></a>
