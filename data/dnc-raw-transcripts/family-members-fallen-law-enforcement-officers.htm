<p class='short_transcript'> >> GOOD EVENING. I'M THE YOUNGEST OF EIGHT CHILDREN BORN TO MIGRANT
WORKERS. WHEN I TOLD MY FATHER THAT I WAS GOING TO JOIN THE POLICE, HE GOT
ANGRY.<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> YOU SEE, HE AND MY OLDER BROTHER HAD BEEN BEATEN BY THE POLICE FOR NO LEGITIMATE REASON. BUT I STUCK WITH MY DECISION. YEARS LATER, WHENEVER I VISIT, SHOW MY BADGE TO ALL MY FRIENDS. HE SAW THE GOOD I WAS DOING AND
HE WAS PROUD OF ME. AND I ARE PROUD OF MY FELLOW
OFFICERS.
[CHEERS] WHEN MY OFFICERS REPORT FOR
DUTY, THEY HAVE NO IDEA WHAT
MIGHT COME UP THAT DAY. WHEN THEY RESPOND TO A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CALL, THEY DON'T KNOW
WHETHER A VICTIM OR THE BEAST
WITH A GUN WILL MEET THEM AT THE
DOOR. WHEN THEY STOP AT VEHICLE, THEY
HAVE NO IDEA WHETHER THE DRIVER
IS RACING TO THE HOSPITAL TO
DELIVER A DEEP -- A BABY OR FLEET A CRIME. THEY DON'T KNOW WHETHER THE NEXT
911 CALL WILL BE THE LAST. BUT THEY KEEP ANSWERING THE CALL. THEY KEEP PUTTING A LIFE ON THE
LINE. THEY ARE DOING THE BEST THEY CAN
TO PROTECT OUR COMMUNITY. WE PUT ON OUR BADGE EVERY DAY TO
SERVE AND PROTECT.
NOT TO HATE AND DISCRIMINATE.
[CHEERS] WE LOST FIVE OFFICERS IN DALLAS. THEY WERE KILLED AS THEY WERE PROTECTING CITIZENS PROTESTING
THE POLICE. IT HAS BEEN A TOUGH TIME FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT COMMITTEES ALL
ACROSS AMERICA WHO HAVE LOST OFFICE OF THE VIOLENCE. I'VE BEEN TRYING TO MAKE SENSE
OUT OF IT, BUT VIOLENCE IS NOT
THE ANSWER. YELLING, SCREAMING, CALLING EACH OTHER NAMES IS NOT GOING TO DO IT. TALKING WITHIN YOUR OWN GROUP IN
YOUR OWN LANGUAGE ONLY WHERE OUR GROUPS UNDERSTAND LEADS NOWHERE. WE HAVE TO START LISTENING TO
EACH OTHER.
[CHEERS] MY DEPUTIES WORK HARD TO REACH
OUT TO THE COMMUNITY WE SERVE. WE ATTEND ALSO TO THE EVENTS,
FROM A DON, CINCO DE MAYO,
PRIDE, VETERANS PARADE, IRIS FESTIVAL, YOU NAME IT. WE SHALL. SOME OF MY OFFICERS -- THE ONLY
WAY TO SERVE YOUR COMMUNITY IS
TO KNOW YOUR COMMITTEE. LAST SUNDAY AFTER WORKING IN THE MORNING, I WENT IN UNIFORM TO
MEET MY PARTNER FOR LUNCH AT A
NICE RESTAURANT. AS I HANDED THE SERVER MY CREDIT CARD, HE SMILED AND SAID AAT LEAST FOUR TABLES HAD OFFERED TO
PAY FOR THE MEAL. MY GIRLFRIEND AND I BOTH TEARED. THERE WAS NOT PHYSICAL PERSON IN THE RESTAURANT I KNEW.
-- A SINGLE PERSON IN THE
RESTAURANT I DO. EVEN THOUGH THE MEN AND WOMEN ARE HURTING, WE NEVER STOP DOING
THE JOB.
[CHEERS] PLEASE HELP ME IN HONOR OF ALL
THE AMERICAN FALLEN OFFICERS WITH A MOMENT OF SILENCE. I AM PRIVILEGED TO INTRODUCE TO
YOU SOME OF THE FAMILY MEMBERS
OF OUR FALLEN OFFICERS. WAYNE WALKER, JENNIFER LOUDEN AND WAYNE OWENS.

<p class='short_transcript'> >> GOOD EVENING, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. FOR 19 YEARS, MY SON PROTECTED US AS A PHILADELPHIA POLICE OFFICER.
[CHEERS] EVERY MORNING, FOR 19 YEARS, HE
PUT<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> ON HIS UNIFORM. ONE MORNING ON THE WAY HOME,
FROM HIS THIRD SHIFT, HE WAS
SHOT AND KILLED. IN HIS LIVING ROOM, I FOUND A PILE OF WRAPPED CHRISTMAS PRESENTS. IT WAS AUGUST. HE ALWAYS THOUGHT AHEAD.
HE BOUGHT GIFTS FOR RELATIVES, SINGLE PARENTS, STRANGERS DOWN
ON THEIR LUCK.
ONE OF THE PRESIDENTS DO NOT
HAVE A NAME ON IT -- PRESENT
THOSE NOT HAVE A NAME ON IT. HE DID NOT LIVE LONG ENOUGH TO
GIVE ALL THE GIFTS HE HAD TO
GIVE. WHILE WE ARE HERE, WE MUST DO THE GOOD WE CAN.
[CHEERS] WE HAVE TO BELIEVE THAT WE ARE
STARTED TOGETHER. THANK YOU.
[CHEERS] WE HEAR A LOT ABOUT THE PROBLEMS
IN BIG CITIES. OUR SON JOHN -- JOIN THE
CLEVELAND POLICE FORCE TO BE
PART OF THE SOLUTION. HIS WIFE WORKED MORNINGS SO HE
WAS THE ONE WHO COME TO HIS
DAUGHTERS HAIR.
HIS FRIENDS JUMPED AND SAID HE
-- JOKED AND SAID HE MADE IT
HARDER FOR THE OTHER  BECAUSE HE
DID SUCH A GOOD JOB.
[CHEERS] AFTER HE WAS KILLED, WE HEARD
FROM SOME OF THE HIS POSITIVE INFLUENCE.
ONE WOMAN SAID THAT WHEN SHE WAS
A TROUBLED TEENAGER, DERRICKS ON HER WHAT SHE CANNOT SEE IT
HERSELF. BECAUSE OF HIM, SHE'S A BETTER
MOTHER. THIS WAS JUST ONE OF THE MANY STORIES, DEREK HAS LEFT A LEGACY
OF SERVICE AND INTEGRITY AND
LOVE. AND WE, WE NEVER WANT TO SACRIFICE -- THE SACRIFICE OF DEREK AND THE OTHER OFFICERS TO BE FORGOTTEN. THANK YOU.
[CHEERS]
>> MY HUSBAND AND BEST FRIEND
JOINED THE CHICAGO POLICE TO
HELP PEOPLE. ONCE, HE GOT A CALL ABOUT A BOY. THE BOY ONLY HAD A ROPE TO KEEP
HIS PANTS ON SO HE STOLE ADULT. THE CHARGES WERE DROPPED. HE ALSO PAID FOR THE BELT.
[CHEERS] HE DID NOT WANT THAT BOY TO
START HIS LIFE WITH A RECORD. HE KNEW THAT EVERY INTERACTION
HE HAD MATTERED. EVERY WORD HE SPOKE, AND EVERY ARREST HE MADE THE FIND WHAT IT
MEANT TO SERVE AND PROTECT. HE KNEW EFFECTIVE POLICING REQUIRED TREATING PEOPLE WITH
KINDNESS AND RESPECT. ESPECIALLY WHEN HE WAS MOST OFTEN CALLED DURING THE WORST
MOMENTS. WHEN I LOST HIM, I HAD NO IDEA
IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO LOSE SO MUCH, MUCH LESS AN ETHICAL
MOMENT. AND I KNOW IN LIGHT OF RECENT
EVENTS, SOME OF US HAVE LOST EIGHTH.
I WANT ALL AMERICANS TO KNOW
ABOUT MOSYS, DEREK, THOR AND ALL
THE OFFICERS OUT THERE WHO RISK
THEIR LIVES PROTECTING ALL OF
US.
[CHEERS] LET US HONOR ALL OF THE FALLEN OFFICERS WHO WERE NOT NAMED HERE TODAY BY ASKING AS OUR OFFICERS
DID, HELPING OTHERS, BRIDGING COMMUNITIES, AND LOVING PEACE -- BUILDING PEACE.
[CHEERS] THANK YOU.
