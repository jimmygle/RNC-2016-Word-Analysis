<p class='short_transcript'> >> HELLO. HELLO. HELLO.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] I NEED YOU ALL TO HEAR ME
TONIGHT. ME TOO MOMENTS TO TELL YOU HOW GOOD GOD IS. HALLELUJAH. MMM. GIVE ME<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> A MOMENT TO SAY THANK
YOU.
WE ARE NOT STANDING HERE BECAUSE HE'S NOT GOOD, WE ARE STANDING
HERE BECAUSE HE'S GREAT.
[APPLAUSE] ONE YEAR AGO YESTERDAY, I LIVED
THE WORST NIGHTMARE ANYONE COULD IMAGINE. I WATCHED AS MY. OR -- AS MY DAUGHTER, SANDRA BLAND, WAS
LOWERED INTO THE GROUND IN A COFFIN.
SHE WAS MY FOURTH OF FIVE DAUGHTERS AND SHE WAS GONE. NO, NO, NOT ON ADMINISTRATIVE
LEAVE BUT ON PERMANENT LEAVE FROM THIS EARTH.
FOUND HANGING IN A JAIL CELL
AFTER AN UNLAWFUL TRAFFIC STOP
AND AN UNLAWFUL ARREST. SIX OF THE WOMEN HAVE DIED IN CUSTODY THAT SAME MONTH. KENDRA CHATMAN, ALEXIS MCGOVERN, SERA LEE. RAQUINA JONES, JOYCE KERNELL. SO MANY OF OUR CHILDREN ARE GONE
BUT THEY ARE NOT FORGOTTEN. I AM HERE WITH HILLARY CLINTON TONIGHT.
[APPLAUSE] BECAUSE SHE IS A LEADER AND A MOTHER WHO WILL SAY OUR
CHILDREN'S NAMES.
[APPLAUSE] SHE KNOWS THAT WHEN A YOUNG,
BLACK LIFE IS CUT SHORT, IT'S NOT JUST A LOSS, IT'S A PERSONAL LOSS, A NATIONAL LOSS, IT'S A LOSS THAT DIMINISHES ALL OF US. WHAT A BLESSING TONIGHT TO BE STANDING HERE SO THAT SANDY CAN STILL SPEAK THROUGH HER MAMA.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
>> AND WHAT A BLESSING IT IS FOR
ALL OF US THAT WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY, IF WE SEE IT, WE
HAVE GOT TO SEIZE IT, TO CAST OUR VOTES.

<strong>Lucia "Lucy" K. McBath</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> FOR A PRESIDENT WHO WILL HELP LEAD US
DOWN THE PATH TOWARD RESTORATION AND CHANGE.
[APPLAUSE] YOU DON'T STOP BEING A MOM WHEN YOUR CHILD DIES, YOU DON'T<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> STOP
BEING A PARENT.
I AM STILL JORDAN DAVIS'S MOTHER.
[APPLAUSE] HIS LIFE ENDED THE DAY HE WAS
SHOT AND KILLED FOR PLAYING LOUD MUSIC, BUT MY JOB AS HIS MOTHER DIDN'T. I STILL WAKE UP EVERY DAY
THINKING ABOUT HOW TO PARENT HIM
, HOW TO PROTECT HIM AND HIS
LEGACY, HOW TO ENSURE HIS DEATH DOESN'T OVERSHADOW HIS LIFE. HERE IS WHAT YOU DON'T KNOW ABOUT MY SON.
WHEN JORDAN WAS LITTLE, HE WOULD
EAT A POPSICLE UNLESS HE HAD
ENOUGH TO BRING OUT TO HIS
FRIENDS. HE LOVED PRACTICAL JOKES, HE LIKED HAVING THESE CONVERSATIONS WITH ME ABOUT OUR LOVE FOR GOD AND HOW GOD COULD ALLOW SUCH PAIN AND SUFFERING. I LIVED IN FEAR THAT MY SON
WOULD DIE LIKE THIS. I EVEN WARNED HIM THAT BECAUSE
HE WAS A YOUNG, BLACK MAN, HE WOULD MEET PEOPLE WHO DIDN'T VALUE HIM OR HIS LIFE. THAT IS A CONVERSATION THAT NO
PARENT SHOULD EVER HAVE WITH THEIR CHILD.
[APPLAUSE] HILLARY CLINTON ISN'T AFRAID TO
SAY THAT BLACK LIVES MATTER.
[APPLAUSE] SHE ISN'T AFRAID TO SIT AT A
TABLE WITH GRIEVING MOTHERS AND
THEIR THE FULL FORCE OF OUR ENGLISH.
-- ANGUISH.
SHE DOESN'T BUILD WALLS AROUND HER HEART. NOT ONLY DID TO LISTEN TO OUR PROBLEMS, SHE INVITED US TO BECOME A PART OF THE SOLUTIONS. AND THAT IS WHAT WE ARE GOING TO
DO.
[APPLAUSE] WE ARE GOING TO KEEP TELLING OUR CHILDREN'S STORIES AND WE ARE URGING YOU TO SAY THEIR NAMES.
WE ARE GOING TO KEEP BUILDING A
FUTURE WHERE POLICE OFFICERS AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR WORK TOGETHER IN MUTUAL RESPECT TO KEEP CHILDREN LIKE JORDAN SAFE. THE MAJORITY OF POLICE OFFICERS
ARE GOOD PEOPLE DOING A GOOD
JOB. AND WE ARE ASKING -- AND WE ARE
ALSO GOING TO KEEP USING OUR VOICES AND OUR VOTES TO SUPPORT LEADERS LIKE HILLARY CLINTON, WHO WILL HELP US PROTECT ONE
ANOTHER SO THAT THIS CLUB OF
HEARTBROKEN MOTHERS STOPS GROWING.

<strong>Sybrina Fulton</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> FIRST OF ALL, I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT IT'S AN HONOR TO BE HERE AND STAND WITH THESE MOTHERS AND BE WITH YOU.
I AM AN UNWILLING PARTICIPANT IN
THIS<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> MOVEMENT.
I WOULD NOT HAVE SIGNED UP FOR
THIS OR ANY OTHER MOTHER STANDING WITH ME TODAY, BUT I AM
HERE TODAY FOR MY SON, TRAYVON MARTIN, WHO IS IN HEAVEN. AND ALSO FOR HIS BROTHER, WHO IS
STILL HERE ON EARTH. I DID NOT WANT THE SPOTLIGHT. BUT I WILL DO EVERYTHING I CAN
TO FOCUS SOME OF THIS LIGHT ON THE PAIN OF A PATH OUT OF THE DARKNESS. HILLARY CLINTON HAS THE COMPASSION AND UNDERSTANDING TO SUPPORT GRIEVING MOTHERS.
SHE HAS THE COURAGE TO LEAD THE
FIGHT FOR COMMON SENSE GUN
LEGISLATION.
[APPLAUSE] SHE HAS A PLAN TO DEVISE -- TO
ADDRESS THE DIVIDE THAT SO OFTEN EXIST BETWEEN LAW ENFORCEMENT IN
THE COMMUNITY THEY SERVE. THIS ISN'T ABOUT BEING
POLITICALLY CORRECT.
THIS IS ABOUT SAVING OUR CHILDREN.
THAT IS WHY WE ARE HERE TONIGHT WITH HILLARY CLINTON, AND THAT
IS WHY, IN MEMORY OF OUR CHILDREN, WE ARE IMPLORING YOU, ALL OF YOU, TO VOTE THIS ELECTION DAY. HILLARY IS ONE MOTHER WHO CAN ENSURE OUR MOVEMENT WILL
SUCCEED. I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR STANDING
WITH US AND SUPPORTING US, AND
WE WOULD LIKE TO LEAVE WITH YOU
WHAT GOD HAS GIVEN US, STRENGTH, LOVE, AND PEACE.
THANK YOU.</span><span class='hidden-full-transcript-ellipses'>...</span></p><a href='#' class='hidden-full-transcript-link'><i class='icon-chevron-down'></i> <span class='link-show-full-text'>Show Full Text</span><i class='icon-chevron-up'></i> <span class='link-show-less-text'>Show Less Text</span></a>
