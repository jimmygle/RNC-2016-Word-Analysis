<strong>Alison Lundergan Grimes</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> MS. GRIMES: THANK YOU. GOOD EVENING, MY FELLOW AMERICANS. I AM ALISON GRIMES, THE YOUNGEST
FEMALE SECRETARY OF STATE IN THE NATION. I AM HONORED TO JOIN<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> YOU TONIGHT REPRESENTING NOT ONLY THE SOUTH,
A GREAT COMMONWEALTH OF KENTUCKY
-- BUT THE GREAT COMMONWEALTH OF
KENTUCKY. I HAVE NO HILLARY CLINTON THE
MAJORITY OF MY LIFE, OR THAN 20
YEARS. AS FIRST LADY, SENATOR,
SECRETARY OF STATE, A MENTOR,
AND A FRIEND. SIX MONTHS FROM NOW, FRIENDS, I
HOPE WE KNOW HER BY ANOTHER NAME
-- MADAM PRESIDENT. I MET HILLARY WHILE GREETING HER AND PRESIDENT CLINTON WITH MY
SISTERS ON THE STEPS OF THE
LINCOLN MEMORIAL IN JANUARY
1993. I COULD NEVER HAVE IMAGINED THAT YEARS LATER SHE WOULD WRITE,
CALL, CHECK UP ON ME IN LOSS GO, HELP ME WHEN MY FIRST EVER
CAMPAIGN FOR KENTUCKY SECRETARY
OF STATE, AND STAND BY MY SIDE
AS THEY TOOK ON ONE OF THE NATION'S BIGGEST BULLIES, MITCH MCCONNELL. I AM PROUD TO BE A PART OF A NEW GENERATION OF SOUTHERN DEMOCRATS, AND I WOULD NOT BE
HERE WITHOUT HILLARY CLINTON. FOR ME, THIS IS PERSONAL, AND I
KNOW IT IS FOR YOU, TOO. HILLARY I KNOW IS CARING AND COMPASSIONATE.
SHE REMINDS ME TO SLOW DOWN AND
SPEND TIME WITH MY FAMILY. SHE WAS THE FIRST TO CALL ME
WHEN BOTH OF MY GRANDMOTHER'S'S PASSED AND I KNOW HOW SHE WEARS
THE NAMES, CLOSEST TO HER HEART
ON A BRACELET SHE IS NEVER WITHOUT. THE HILLARY I KNOW CAN DEVOUR BUFFALO WINGS. AND MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE, SHE
LOVES TO LISTEN. TO HILLARY I KNOW FIGHTS FOR ALL PEOPLE, THROUGH CAUSES WE HAD
BOTH CHAMPIONED INCLUDING EQUAL
PAY. AS AN ORIGINAL COSPONSOR OF THE LEDBETTER ACT, CLINTON WILL NOT
REST UNTIL EVERY WOMAN RECEIVES
EQUAL PAY. SHE KNOWS IT IS NOT A WOMAN'S ISSUE.
THIS IS A FAMILIES ISSUE. VOTING RIGHTS, HILLARY BELIEVES
LIKE I DO THAT IF YOU PAI YOURD
DEBT TO SOCIETY, YOU SHOULD NOT
BE SENTENCED TO A LIFE OF SILENCE. AND THE HILLARY I KNOW, SHE IS A FIGHTER, A FIGHTER FOR COLLEGE AFFORDABILITY, FOR PENSIONS FOR OUR TIRED COAL MINERS, AND FOR
-- FOR OUR COAL MINERS, AND FOR
AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE. SHE FIGHTS FOR EVERYTHING THAT
DONALD TRUMP FIGHTS AGAINST.
IN THIS ELECTION, WE HAVE THE
CHANCE, THE OPPORTUNITY TO SEND A MESSAGE. IF YOU CONDEMN THE HATE SPEECH
AND DIVISIVE POLICIES OF DONALD TRUMP'S GOP, THEN STAND UP. IF YOU CONDEMN GRIDLOCK AND OBSTRUCTION, STAND UP. AND IF YOU THINK THAT THE LAST THING THIS NATION NEEDS IN OUR
WHITE HOUSE, IN THE OVAL OFFICE,
IS AN UNSTEADY, AND QUALIFIED BULLY, WHO POINT FINGERS INSTEAD OF OFFERING A HAND TO THE DEFENSELESS, STAND UP. TOGETHER, MY FELLOW AMERICANS,
LET'S STAND UP AND ELECTED AS
THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES THE WOMAN WHO HAS ALWAYS STOOD FOR EACH OF US, HILLARY
RODHAM CLINTON. THANK YOU, EACH OF US. GOD BLESS AMERICA.</span><span class='hidden-full-transcript-ellipses'>...</span></p><a href='#' class='hidden-full-transcript-link'><i class='icon-chevron-down'></i> <span class='link-show-full-text'>Show Full Text</span><i class='icon-chevron-up'></i> <span class='link-show-less-text'>Show Less Text</span></a>
