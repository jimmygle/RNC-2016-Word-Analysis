<strong>Stephen "Steve" K. Benjamin</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> MAYOR BENJAMIN: GOOD EVENING.
I LOVE SOUTH CAROLINA. GOOD EVENING TO ALL OF OUR
FRIENDS AND FAMILY HERE AND BACK
HOME IN THE GREAT PALMETTO STATE
OF SOUTH<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> CAROLINA. TONIGHT, I AM NOT HERE AS A
MAYOR, DELEGATE, OR EVEN AS A DELICATE -- DEMOCRAT. I AM HERE AS A FATHER WITH A PROMISE TO KEEP.
A YEAR AGO, I HAD THE PLEASURE
OF INTRODUCING OUR OLDEST DAUGHTER, BETHANY, TO THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, HILLARY CLINTON. ONE OF MY PROUDEST MOMENTS AS A FATHER WAS WATCHING BETHANY
SHAKE HILLARY'S HAND WITH THE CONFIDENCE THAT WOULD ESCAPE MOST ADULTS AND ANNOUNCED THAT
HILLARY HAD HER FULL SUPPORT BECAUSE, AND I QUOTE, THE GUYS
HAD BEEN PRESIDENT LONG ENOUGH
AND NOW IT'S TIME FOR A WOMAN TO TAKE CONTROL.
HILLARY TOLD BETHANY THAT SHE
WAS THE SMARTEST 10-YEAR-OLD IN
THE WORLD. WHO WAS I TO DISAGREE? AFTER THAT MEETING, I WROTE A
LETTER TO BETHANY, AND TO OUR
YOUNGEST DAUGHTER, JORDAN GRACE,
PROMISING MY GIRLS THAT I WOULD
DO EVERYTHING IN MY POWER TO
ELECT HILLARY CLINTON, BECAUSE I
WANT MY DAUGHTERS TO KNOW THE SAME OPPORTUNITIES I HAVE.
I WANT THEM TO FEEL THE SAME WAY I FELT EIGHT YEARS AGO WHEN PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA WAS ELECTED. TO FEEL IN THEIR HEART OF HEARTS
THAT IN AMERICA, ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE, BECAUSE IT IS. I WANT THEM TO KNOW THAT SUGAR AND SPICE ARE NICE, BUT COURAGE,
INTELLIGENCE, AND THE WILL TO LEAD, THAT'S WHAT WOMEN ARE MADE
OF. THAT IS THE MODEL MY WIFE AND
MOTHER ARE SETTING FOR OUR DAUGHTERS, YOUR DAUGHTERS, AND ALL OF OUR CHILDREN. THIS PROMISE IS MINE TO KEEP SO
THAT ALL CHILDREN NO, NOT JUST
BELIEVE, BUT KNOW THAT THIS IS
THEIR AMERICA TOO. THAT ALL MEN ARE CREATED EQUAL DOES NOT JUST MEAN MEN ANYMORE. MY DAUGHTERS AND ALL OF OUR CHILDREN ARE WATCHING.
ALL OF AMERICA IS WATCHING. CAN WE KEEP THAT PROMISE FOR
THEM? ARE WE READY FOR HILLARY?
DO YOU HEAR THAT, GIRLS? I THINK WE'VE GOT IT FROM HERE. GOOD NIGHT. SWEET DREAMS. YOUR DADDY LOVES YOU SO MUCH.</span><span class='hidden-full-transcript-ellipses'>...</span></p><a href='#' class='hidden-full-transcript-link'><i class='icon-chevron-down'></i> <span class='link-show-full-text'>Show Full Text</span><i class='icon-chevron-up'></i> <span class='link-show-less-text'>Show Less Text</span></a>
