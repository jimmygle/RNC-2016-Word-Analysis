<strong>Unidentified Speaker</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> YOU WANT TO SEE THE BEST OF AMERICA, YOU NEED LOOK NO FURTHER THAN ARMY CAPTAIN KHIZR KHAN. HE MOVED TO MARYLAND AS A SMALL
CHILD.
HE GRADUATED FROM<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> THE UNIVERSITY
OF VIRGINIA. BEFORE ENLISTING IN THE UNITED
STATES ARMY. IN JUNE 2004, HE WAS SERVING IN
IRAQ. ONE DAY WHILE HIS INFANTRY UNIT
WAS GUARDING THE GATES OF THE BASE, A SUSPICIOUS BIG OLD
APPEARED. CAPTAIN KHAN TOLD HIS TRIP TO
GET BACK. BUT HE WENT FORWARD. HE TOOK 10 STEPS TOWARD THE CAR
BEFORE IT EXPLODED. CAPTAIN KHAN WAS KILLED BUT HIS
UNIT WAS SAVED BY HIS COURAGEOUS
ACT. CAPTAIN KHAN WAS POSTHUMOUSLY
AWARDED THE BRONZE STAR AND
PURPLE HEART. HE WAS JUST 27 YEARS OLD. WE STILL WONDER WHAT MADE HIM
TAKE THOSE 10 STEPS. KHAN'S FATHER SAID IN A RECENT
INTERVIEW. MAYBE THAT IS THE POINT. ALL THE VALUES, ALTHOUGH SERVICE TO COUNTRY, ALL THE THINGS HE
LEARNED IN THIS COUNTRY KICKED
IN. IT WAS THOSE VALUES THAT MADE HIM TAKE THOSE 10 STEPS. THOSE 10 STEPS TOLD US WE DID
NOT MAKE A MISTAKE IN MOVING TO THIS COUNTRY, HIS FATHER FINISHED. HE STOOD UP AND SAID WE ARE
AMERICANS, WE WILL NOT TURN ON
EACH OTHER AND TURN ON
PRINCIPLES.
THAT IS WHAT WE DO HERE.
THAT IS WHO WE ARE.
THAT IS HOW WE WILL WIN.
THAT IS THE AMERICA THAT I KNOW ACCESS ALL SO PROUD TO BE A PART
OF IT. THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH.

<p class='short_transcript'> >> OUR HEARTS AND PRAYERS ARE WITH THE VETERANS. AND THOSE WHO SERVE TODAY. TONIGHT WE ARE HONORED TO STAND HERE TOGETHER. AND AS PATRIOTIC AMERICAN
MUSLIMS.
[CHEERS]<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> AS PATRIOTIC AMERICAN MUSLIMS
WITH UNDIVIDED LOYALTY TO THE
COUNTRY.
[CHEERS] LIKE MANY IMMIGRANTS, WE CAME TO THIS COUNTRY EMPTY HANDED. WE BELIEVED IN AMERICA DEMOCRACY THAT WITH HARD WORK AND GOODNESS
OF THIS COUNTRY, WE COULD SHARE IN AND CONTRIBUTE TO ITS
BLESSINGS.
[CHEERS] WE ARE BLESSED TO RAISE OUR THREE SONS IN A NATION WHERE
THEY ARE FREE TO BE THEMSELVES
AND FOLLOW THEIR DREAMS.
[CHEERS] OUR SON IN MY OWN HEAD, HAD
DREAMS ALSO. DREAMS OF BEING A MILITARY LAWYER, BUT HE PUT THOSE DREAMS ASIDE THE DAY HE SACRIFICED TO SAVE THE LIVES OF HIS FELLOW SOLDIERS.
[CHEERS] HILLARY CLINTON WAS RIGHT WHEN
SHE CALLED MY SON THE BEST OF AMERICA.
[CHEERS] IF IT WAS UP TO DONALD TRUMP, HE NEVER WOULD HAVE BEEN IN
AMERICA. DONALD TRUMP CONSISTENTLY SMEARS THE CHARACTER OF MUSLIMS. HE DISRESPECTS OTHER MINORITIES, WOMEN, JUDGES, EVEN HIS OWN
PARTY LEADERSHIP. HE LOVES TO BUILD WALLS AND BAD
US FROM THIS COUNTRY -- BAN US FROM THIS COUNTRY.</span><span class='hidden-full-transcript-ellipses'>...</span></p><a href='#' class='hidden-full-transcript-link'><i class='icon-chevron-down'></i> <span class='link-show-full-text'>Show Full Text</span><i class='icon-chevron-up'></i> <span class='link-show-less-text'>Show Less Text</span></a>

TRUST YOU WITH THE FUTURE, LET
ME ASK YOU HAVE TO EVEN READ THE
UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION?
[CHEERS]<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> I WILL GLAD YOU -- GLADLY LEND
YOU MY COPY.
[CHEERS] LOOK FOR THE WORD LIBERTY AND EQUAL PROTECTION OF LAW.
[CHEERS] HAVE YOU EVER BEEN TO ARLINGTON CEMETERY? TO LOOK AT THE GRAVES OF BRAVE PATRIOTS WHO DIED DEFENDING THE
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. YOU WILL SEE ALL FAITHS, GENDERS, AND ETHNICITIES
[CHEERS]
.
[CHEERS] YOU HAVE SACRIFICED NOTHING.
[CHEERS] AND NO ONE, WE CANNOT FAULT OUR PROBLEMS -- SOLVE OUR PROBLEMS BUT BUILDING WALLS. SOWING DIVISION, WE ARE STARTING
TOGETHER.
-- STRONGER TOGETHER.
[CHEERS] AND WE WILL KEEP GETTING
STRONGER WHEN HILLARY CLINTON BECOMES OUR PRESIDENT.
[CHEERS] IN CONCLUSION, I ASK EVERY PATRIOTIC AMERICAN, ALL MUSLIM IMMIGRANTS AND ALL IMMIGRANTS, DO NOT TAKE THIS ELECTION LATELY.
-- LIGHTLY.
[CHEERS] THIS IS A HISTORIC ELECTION IN THE REQUEST TO HONOR THE
SACRIFICE OF MY SON AND ON ELECTION DAY, TAKE THE TIME TO GET OUT AND VOTE AND VOTE FOR THE HEALER, VOTE FOR THE STRONGEST, MOST QUALIFIED
CANDIDATE, HILLARY CLINTON.
NOT THE DIVIDER. GOD BLESS YOU AND THANK YOU.
