SOMETIMES YOU RUN INTO SOME

LIKE YOU SIMPLY FOR<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> BEING YOU, LIKE THAT NOT A GUY DONALD TRUMP ON TV, THE ONE WHO SAYS ALL
THOSE NASTY THINGS ABOUT WOMEN AND ABOUT NATIVE AMERICANS LIKE
US. I'M SO SORRY YOU HAD TO HEAR THAT, MY GIRL. YOUR NAME IS NOT POCAHONTAS.
IT IS SIOBHAN. AND YOU SHOULD NEVER LET ANYONE MAKE YOU FEEL ANYTHING LESS THAN
PROUD OF WHO YOU ARE. BECAUSE DESPITE EVERYTHING THAT
HAS HAPPENED TO OUR PEOPLE, AND
NO MATTER WHAT DONALD TRUMP
SAYS, WE ARE STILL HERE."</span><span class='hidden-full-transcript-ellipses'>...</span></p><a href='#' class='hidden-full-transcript-link'><i class='icon-chevron-down'></i> <span class='link-show-full-text'>Show Full Text</span><i class='icon-chevron-up'></i> <span class='link-show-less-text'>Show Less Text</span></a>

" AND I WANT YOU TO GROW UP WITH OUR PEOPLE'S VALUES, HONORING OUR ELDERS, SHOWING
GRATITUDE TO OUR WARRIORS,
CHERISHING OUR<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> CHILDREN AS GIFTS
FROM THE CREATOR. I ALSO WANT YOU TO GROW UP
KNOWING THAT OUR PRESIDENT
SHARES THOSE VALUES, TOO. THAT IS WHY WE WILL HAVE THAT
HILLARY SIGN ON OUR LAWN. WE CAN TRUST HER TO KEEP OUR
WOMEN SAFE, OUR VETERANS WELL CARED FOR, AND KEEP THE PROMISES THE UNITED STATES HAS MADE IT TO OUR TRIBE. MOST IMPORTANTLY, HILLARY KNOWS
THAT OUR CHILDREN ARE SACRED. BACK BEFORE YOU WERE BORN,
HILLARY WORKED AT A PLACE CALLED
THE CHILDREN'S DEFENSE FUND,
JUST LIKE YOUR MOMMY, HELPING TO
MAKE SURE THAT KIDS WITH
DISABILITIES COULD GO TO GOOD SCHOOLS, JUST LIKE EVERYONE
ELSE. AND THEN, ALSO JUST LIKE YOUR MOMMY, SHE DECIDED TO RUN FOR OFFICE, AND THE POLICE DID NOT
LIKE THAT AT ALL. BUT HILLARY DID LET THEM STOP
HER. SHE NEVER LET BULLIES
STOP HER AND NEITHER SHOULD YOU. YOU CAN'T RUN TO BE THE FIRST
NATIVE AMERICAN PRESIDENT UNTIL
YOU ARE 35, BUT YOU CAN COME
KNOCK ON DOORS WITH ME FOR
HILLARY THIS FALL, AND I WILL BE SO, SO PROUD TO BRING YOU WITH
ME TO VOTE FOR HER ON NOVEMBER 8, AND SUNDAY, SOMEDAY, I'LL VOTE FOR
YOU.
