<strong>Dannel P. Malloy</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> THANK YOU.
I AM HERE TODAY TO TELL YOU A
STORY OF HOPE, A STORY OF WHY WE
ARE STRONGER TOGETHER. IT IS A STORY OF A YOUNG BOY WITH PHYSICAL AND LEARNING<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> DISABILITIES. READING AND WRITING, ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE. A CHILD THOUGHT TO BE MENTALLY RETARDED AS LATE AS THE FOURTH GRADE. A BOY WHO COULD NOT TIE HIS SHOE
OR BUTTON HIS SHIRT UNTIL THE FIFTH GRADE.
SOMEONE WHO KNEW THE HARD WORDS OF BELIZE IN THE PLAYGROUND -- BULLIES IN THE PLAYGROUND AND DISCRIMINATION. BUT THE BOY HAD GREAT TEACHERS
AND A MOTHER WHO BELIEVED IN
GIVING HIM THE OPPORTUNITY FOR
SUCCESS. HE HAD A SUPPORT SYSTEM WHO
BELIEVED WE ARE STRONGER TOGETHER WHEN WE LEFT UP TO
THOSE WHO FALL BEHIND.
-- LIFT UP THOSE WHO FALL BEHIND.
AND THAT BOY WAS LIFTED UP.
HE WENT ON TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN COLLEGE AND LAW SCHOOL, EARNING THE RIGHT TO BE THE FIRST
LEARNING IMPAIRED PERSON TO TAKE
THE BAR EXAM IN THREE DIFFERENT STATES. TODAY, THAT BOY HAS GROWN UP AND
IS STANDING BEFORE YOU AS THE GOVERNOR OF THE STATE OF
CONNECTICUT. PROUD TO BE ADDRESSING THE
DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL CONVENTION. THIS IS MY STORY, A STORY OF WHY WE ARE STRONGER TOGETHER. IT IS AN AMERICAN STORY. OUR COMMUNITIES ARE BOUND BY THE SHARED UNDERSTANDING THAT WE ARE STRONGER TOGETHER, THAT WE NEED
TO LIFT UP OUR BROTHERS AND SISTERS AND IGNORE THE SHOUTS
AND TAUNTS OF BULLIES
AMONGST US. THAT IS WHY I AM PROUD TO
SUPPORT HILLARY CLINTON FOR
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. LIKE HILLARY CLINTON, AND TIM KAINE, I BELIEVE WE MUST INSTILL HOPE IN EVERY AMERICAN.
IT DOES NOT MATTER THEIR RACE OR GENDER OR WHO THEY LOVE OR WHERE
THEIR PARENTS WERE BORN OR THEIR RELIGION OR WHAT THEY ARE LEARNING ABILITIES -- THEIR
LEARNING ABILITIES ARE -- EVERY
CHILD, EVERY AMERICAN DESERVES
TO HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN THIS LIFE. THAT IS WHAT WE STAND FOR AS DEMOCRATIC GOVERNORS. WE STAND FOR SOLVING PROBLEMS IN
BRINGING HOPE TO MORE AMERICANS. HOPE FOR BETTER SCHOOLS AND FAIRER WAGES AND MORE TIME TO SPEND WITH THE FAMILIES THEY
LOVE.
WE ARE PROUD TO COUNT AMONGST OUR ALUMNI FORMER GOVERNOR BILL CLINTON AND WE ARE PROUD TO COUNT AMONGST OUR ALUMNI FORMER GOVERNOR TIM KAINE. TIM KAINE, AS GOVERNOR OF VIRGINIA, LET HIS STATE THROUGH THE WORST ECONOMIC CRISIS SINCE THE GREAT DEPRESSION WHILE
CREATING JOBS IN THE PROCESS. I'M HERE TO TELL YOU THAT THE MIDDLE CLASS IN AMERICA IS
GETTING STRONGER THANKS TO THE WORK OF DEMOCRATIC GOVERNORS. WASHINGTON, D.C., REPUBLICANS WILL BLOCK ANY INNOVATIVE IDEA
THAT HAS A SCARLET LETTER D FOR DEMOCRAT NEXT TO IT. EVERY DAY, WE WORK TO CREATE
JOBS AND IMPROVE ACCESS TO QUALITY EDUCATION. THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT WE HAVE DONE IN CONNECTICUT.
WE HAVE ADDED OVER 100,000 JOBS
WHILE RAISING THE MINIMUM WAGE. WE PASSED CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM THAT GIVES NONVIOLENT
OFFENDERS A SECOND CHANCE.
WE HAVE LOWERED OUR PRISON
POPULATION BY THOUSANDS AND
THOUSANDS OF INDIVIDUALS WHILE
WE CUT OUR CRIME RATE TO THE
LOWEST IT HAS BEEN IN 48 YEARS. AFTER THE SANDY HOOK SCHOOL TRAGEDY, WE PASSED COMMONSENSE
GUN SAFETY LAWS, INCLUDING
UNIVERSAL BACKGROUND CHECKS IN
OUR STATE OF CONNECTICUT. WE HAVE MOVED TOWARD EQUAL PAY
BY MAKING COMPENSATION MORE TRANSPARENT AND WE WERE THE
FIRST STATE IN THE NATION, FIVE YEARS AGO, TO ASK PAID SICK LEAVE. NOT ONLY ARE OUR WORKERS PROTECTING THEIR HEALTH, BUT THEY ARE PROTECTING --
PROTECTING THE HEALTH OF THE
PEOPLE THEY SERVE. THE BUSINESSES THEY WORK FOR APPROVED OF PAID SICK LEAVE TODAY. DEMOCRATIC GOVERNORS ACROSS THIS COUNTRY ARE LEADING THE WAY. IN NEW YORK IN DELAWARE, WE HAVE
RAISED THE MINIMUM WAGE.
IN RHODE ISLAND AND MONTANA, WE
HAVE TAKEN ACTION FOR EQUAL PAY. IN OREGON AND CALIFORNIA, WE HAVE ASKED PAID SICK LEAVE. WE HAVE DISCUSSED MEDICAID EXPANSION. WE MADE HISTORIC ADVANCEMENT IN EDUCATION, INCLUDING RIGHT HERE AND ALBANIA -- IN SYL PENNSYLVANIA. MEANWHILE, DONALD TRUMP, WHO HAS
INSULTED ANYONE WHO DOES NOT
AGREE WITH THEM OR DOES NOT LOOK LIKE HIM, WOMEN, MEXICAN-AMERICANS, VETERANS,
MUSLIM AMERICANS, THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY, AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES -- YOU NAME THEM
AND DONALD TRUMP HAS BULLIED THEM. I KNOW WHY WE MUST STAND UP TO THEM. IF DONALD TRUMP'S WORDS ARE BAD,
HIS ACTIONS ARE WORSE. LOOK AT HIS VICE PRESIDENTIAL
CHOICE, GOVERNOR MIKE PENCE. WITH THE TRUMP-PENCE TICKETS, IT
IS LIKE A CONTEST TO SEE WHO CAN DISCRIMINATE MORE. MIKE PENCE REJECTED FEDERAL
MONEY THAT WOULD HAVE FUNDED PRE-K FOR 4000 LOW INCOME CHILDREN.
HE SIGNED A LAW THAT WOULD HAVE FORCED WOMEN TO HOLD FUNERALS FOR FETUSES, EVEN IN SOME CASES, AFTER MISCARRIAGES. HE SIGNED A LAW THAT WOULD DENNIS -- DISCRIMINATE AGAINST
PEOPLE BASED ON WHO THEY LOVE. THAT COST INDIANA'S ECONOMY AN ESTIMATED $60 BILLION -- $60 MILLION IN LOST MONEY. GOVERNOR PENCE TURNED HIS BACK
ON RESCUING CHILDREN AND THEIR
PARENTS -- REFUGEE CHILDREN AND THEIR PARENTS. THE FIRST FAMILY OF REFUGEES REJECTED BY HIM ARE NOW WELCOMED RESIDENTS IN THE STATE OF
CONNECTICUT. THE TICKET BRINGS THE WORST OF THE REPUBLICAN GUBERNATORIAL RECORD TO THE NATIONAL STAGE AND IT SHOWS WHY WE NEED TO FIGHT AT
THE LOCAL LEVEL. GOVERNORS WORK WHERE THE RUBBER MEETS THE ROAD. DEMOCRATIC GOVERNORS ARE
CRITICAL TO WINNING THIS BATTLE
AT THE STATE LEVEL.
THAT IS WHY THE ORGANA -- WE ARE THE ONLY ORGANIZATION FOCUSED ON
ELECTING DEMOCRATIC GOVERNORS. WE ARE FIGHTING FOR THESE POLICIES TODAY AND WE ARE
FIGHTING FOR THE FUTURE BY
FOCUSING ON WINNING BACK GOVERNORS SEAT. YOU ALL KNOW THIS.
YOU KNOW THE REPUBLICANS RIGGED
THE MAP IN 2010. THAT IS WHY WE NEED STRONG DEMOCRATIC GOVERNORS TO FIGHT
FOR FAIR MAPS AND THE POLICIES WE ALL BELIEVE IN AND THAT
SHOULD BE COMING OUT OF THE
CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES. TOGETHER, WE CAN AND WILL HELP
LIFT UP EVERY AMERICAN SO THEY
CAN LIVE THE AMERICAN DREAM. WE AS DEMOCRATS BELIEVE WE ARE STRONGER TOGETHER. GOD BLESS YOU AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
