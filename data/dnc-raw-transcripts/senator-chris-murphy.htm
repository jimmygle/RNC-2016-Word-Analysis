<strong>Chris Murphy</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU. THERE ARE DAYS WHEN I WISH I HAD
NOT BEEN THERE.
THERE ARE MOMENTS WHEN I DREADED FOR THE -- TRY TO FORGET THE THINGS<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> I SAW, THE THINGS I HEARD THAT SOUL CRUSHING MORNING AND SANDY COOK -- SANDY HOOK CONNECTICUT.
THE MIND ALTERING PARALYZING SORRY THAT COMES WITH LOSING A CHILD TO GET VIOLENCE.
IT IS FUNDAMENTAL. ONLY THOSE WHO LIVE IT KNOW IT. IN NEWTOWN, FAMILIES OF 21ST
GRADERS AND THEIR SICK TEACHERS
-- SIX TEACHERS LIVE WITH IT
EVERY MINUTE OF EVERY DAY.
ACROSS THE COUNTRY, UNBELIEVABLY, 90 FAMILIES JOINED
THEM. MY OLDER SON IS THE SAME AGE AT THOSE KIDS IN SANDY HOOK.
SHE JUST FINISHED FIRST GRADE. MY WIFE AND I ARE THE SAME AGE
AS THE PARENTS. I AM FURIOUS. I AM CURIOUS -- FURIOUS THAT IN THREE YEARS, THREE YEARS OF
ALMOST DAILY BLOODSHED IN THE
CITIES, THE REPUBLICAN CONGRESS
HAS DONE ABSOLUTELY NOTHING TO
PREVENT THE NEXT MASSACRE.
>> BOO!
>> A SENSE OF OUTRAGE THAT I'VE
NEVER FELT BEFORE. THAT WHAT -- IS WHAT DROVE ME TO
STAND ON THE FLOOR OF THE UNITED
STATES SENATE TO DEMAND CHANGE FOR 15 HOURS.
[CHEERS] I'M HERE TODAY BECAUSE I WANT A PRESIDENT WHO SHARES THAT SAME
SENSE OF OUTRAGE. OUTRAGE THAT THE GUN LOBBY
FIGHTS TO KEEP OPEN GLARING LOOPHOLES THAT 90% OF AMERICANS WANT CLOSED. IF A SUPPLY -- SUSPECTED
TERRORIST CAN WALK INTO A GUN
STORE AND WALK OUT WITH A
MILITARY STYLE SEMIAUTOMATIC
WEAPON, HILLARY CLINTON NOT HAVE TO MAKE FIGHTING TO BALANCE A
CENTERPIECE OF HER CAMPAIGN, I'M SURE PEOPLE TOLD HER IT WAS NOT
WORTH THE POLITICAL RISK, BUT SHE HELD FIRM. SHE STOOD UP TO THE NRA AND HILLARY CLINTON PLEDGED TO TAKE WASHINGTON BACK FROM THE GUN
LOBBY.
[CHEERS] DONALD TRUMP, WHEN HE SEES GUN
VIOLENCE DEVASTATING OUR
COMMUNITIES, IT IS JUST LIKE
EVERYTHING ELSE.
HE SEES IT AS AN OPPORTUNITY. ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY TO CONVINCE AMERICANS THAT THEY SHOULD FEAR
ONE ANOTHER. ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY TO DO THE BAITING OF THE GUN LOBBY. 90% OF AMERICANS WANT THE
BACKGROUND CHECK SYSTEM EXPANDED
TO COVER MORE GUN SALES SO
DANGEROUS WEAPONS DON'T FALL
INTO THE WRONG HANDS.
BUT DONALD TRUMP SAYS IN HIS
FIRST HOUR IN THE OVAL OFFICE,
HE WILL ROLLBACK SAFEGUARDS WE ALREADY HAVE AN EVEN MORE
SINISTER, HE SAID BY THE END OF
HIS FIRST DAY IN OFFICE, HE WILL
MANDATE THAT EVERY SCHOOL IN AMERICA ALLOWS GUNS IN THE
CLASSROOM. THINK ABOUT THAT FOR A MOMENT. OF ALL THE THINGS THAT DONALD TRUMP IN A PROMISED TO DO ON HIS
FIRST DAY OF OFFICE, HE CHOSE WEAKENING BACKGROUND CHECKS AND
PUTTING GUNS IN ELEMENTARY
SCHOOL. THIS IS A FATE WE CANNOT ACCEPT. MY FRIENDS, THERE IS NO REASON
TO FEEL HELPLESS ABOUT THE HORRIFYING TRAJECTORY CASCADING
MASSACRES.
WE CAN CHANGE THIS. SMART GUN POLICY LIKE BACKGROUND
CHECKS COME IT CAN MAKE THIS
COUNTRY SAFER.
I STOOD ON THE FLOOR OF THE
UNITED STATES SENATE FOR 15 HOURS BECAUSE I HAD HAD ENOUGH. ENOUGH OF CHILDREN DYING IN OUR CLASSROOMS.
[CHEERS] ENOUGH OF THE NIGHTLY BLOODSHED
ON THE CITY STREETS. ENOUGH OF POLICE OFFICERS BEING OUTGUNNED, AMBUSHED AND CUT DOWN
IN THE LINE OF DUTY. I'VE HAD ENOUGH.
[CHEERS] AND FRIENDS, IT IS TIME TO TAKE WASHINGTON BACK FROM THE GUN
LOBBY.
[CHEERS] AND I KNOW JUST HOW TO DO IT.
I WANT YOU TO START, I WANT YOU
TO START BY TEXTING THE WORD
LAW. YOU WILL TURN YOURSELF INTO AN
ACTIVIST AND THEN, YOU WILL GO
AND ELECT HILLARY CLINTON AS THE
NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. SHE IS A LEADER WHO HAVE THE
EMPATHY AND THE GUTS TO DECLARE WITH EVERY FIBER IN HER BEING THAT WE HAVE HAD ENOUGH.
[CHEERS] THANK YOU.

<strong>Unidentified Speaker</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> MY WEDDING WAS ON THE LEFT
THINK THAT PLAN WITH MY MOM. IT WAS A VERY BITTERSWEET DAY.
ONE BIG REMINDER OF THE GIANT HOLE WHERE SHE USED TO BE. MY<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> MOM WAS A BEST FRIEND. SHE WAS THE TYPE OF PRINCIPAL WHO KNEW THE NAME OF EVERY CHILD
IN HER SCHOOL. SHE KNEW THE SIBLINGS, COULD PROBABLY TAKE HOW MANY DOGS AND WHAT BREED THEY WERE. ON THE MORNING OF DECEMBER 14, I
GOT AN EMERGENCY ALERT THAT SAID THERE IS A SHOOTING AT SANDY H OOK. I GRABBED MY PURSE AND I GOT MY
KIDS AND WENT STORMING TO THE
CAR. I KEPT THINKING, THIS ISN'T
REAL. I KNEW I WAS GOING TO WAKE UP
FROM ABOUT.
-- A BAD DREAM. WE WAITED AND WAITED. THEY TOLD US IF YOU ARE IN THIS ROOM, IT IS BECAUSE YOUR FAMILY
MEMBER IS NOT COMING OUT. IT WASN'T UNTIL THE FIRST TIME I
SAW IN WRITING, AGE 47, FEMALE,
DECEASED.
CAUSE OF DEATH, MULTIPLE GUNSHOT WOUNDS. DID -- I REALIZE MY MOM DID NOT
DIE, SHE WAS MURDERED. AND THAT MADE ME ANGRY. THAT MADE ME ACT. HILLARY CLINTON IS THE ONLY CANDIDATE THAT HAS WHAT IT TAKES TO TAKE ON THE GUN LOBBY. NO ONE IS BITING HARDER T -- F IGHTING HARDER TO REFORM THE LAWS.
REMINDS ME OF MY MOTHER. I BELIEVE IN HER. MILLIONS OF OTHER AMERICANS
BELIEVE HER. THERE IS FINALLY SOMEONE WHO CAN
CHANGE THINGS.
