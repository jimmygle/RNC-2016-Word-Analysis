<strong>Leticia Van de Putte</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> GOOD AFTERNOON. I'M LETICIA VANDERPUGH, A
SEVENTH GENERATION TEXAN. MY GRANDMOTHER'SS WERE BORN IN MEXICO. THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN SO PROUD TO
SEE ME<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> STANDING HERE TODAY. COCHAIR OF THE 2016 DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL CONVENTION RULES
COMMITTEE. SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN, MY GRANDMOTHERS WOULD HAVE BEEN SO
PROUD. I ALSO REPORT. MORE THAN TWO CENTURIES AGO, A
GROUP OF COURAGEOUS INDIVIDUALS GATHERED AT INDEPENDENCE HALL, A FEW BLOCKS FROM HERE, TO GIVE BIRTH TO OUR GREAT COUNTRY AND A
GOVERNMENT OF THE PEOPLE, BY THE PEOPLE AND FOR THE PEOPLE. FOR MY GRANDMOTHERS, THEY KNEW
THAT IN THIS UNITED STATES OF
AMERICA, THE MOST MEANINGFUL TITLE THAT ANYONE COULD EVER HOLD IS THE TITLE CITIZEN.
[APPLAUSE] MY GRANDMOTHER BECAME A CITIZEN
AT AGE 68.
HER PROUDEST DAY WAS THE DAY WHEN SHE PASSED HER FIRST VOTE. AND AS DEMOCRATS, WE MUST DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO ENSURE THA
T OUR PARTY CARRIES ON THIS
TRADITION THAT MAKES US STRONGER
AS A COUNTRY. SO, WE ARE PROPOSING THE
CREATION OF THE UNITY REFORM COMMISSION. THIS COMMISSION HAS WON OVERWHELMING SUPPORT FROM ALL MEMBERS OF THE RULES COMMITTEE. AND TOGETHER, WE'RE GOING TO SEE WHAT IS WORTHY, WHAT IS NOT WORKING AND WE ARE GOING TO WORK TOGETHER TO BUILD A STRONGER
DEMOCRATIC PARTY FOR OUR
CHILDREN. AND THE COMMISSION WILL MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS REGARDING UNPLEDGED DELEGATES TO BE SURE OUR PROCESS REFLECTS OUR TRUE
DEMOCRATIC VALUES AND OUR
UNWAVERING BELIEF AND OUR REPRESENTATIVE DEMOCRACY. WE ARE GOING TO OPEN UP OUR DEMOCRATIC PROCESS SO THAT THE GRASSROOTS ALWAYS HAS A SEAT AT THE TABLE.
[APPLAUSE] WE ARE GOING TO ENSURE THAT OUR PARTY HEARS EVERY VOICE AND
EMPOWERS EVERY PERSON WITH A
CHANCE TO CONTRIBUTE. SO TO ALL THE ACTIVISTS, TO THE
ORGANIZERS, TO THE OFFICIALS AND THE VOLUNTEERS AND THE FAMILIES AND COMMUNITY LEADERS OUT THERE,
WE HEAR YOU. WE RESPECT YOU. THIS UNITY COMMISSION WILL WORK FOR YOU TO BUILD A THRIVING, GROWING DEMOCRATIC PARTY TODAY, TOMORROW AND FOR GENERATIONS TO
COME. MUCHAS GRACIAS.

<strong>Wellington Webb</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> MR. WEBB: HI. I'M WELLINGTON WEBB, THE FORMER MAYOR OF DENVER, COLORADO. AN AT-LARGE MEMBER OF THE RULES
COMMITTEE AND A LONGTIME
SUPPORTER OF HILLARY<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> CLINTON.
[APPLAUSE] YESTERDAY, I WAS PROUD TO TAKE
PART OF THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE
UNITY REFORM COMMISSION WHICH
WAS FORMED IN COLLABORATION BETWEEN THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN AND
THE SANDERS CAMPAIGN AND THE
DNC. THE COMMISSION IS MADE UP OF REPRESENTATIVES FROM BOTH CAMPAIGNS AND THE DEMOCRATIC
NATIONAL COMMITTEE.
IT IS CHARGED WITH ASSESSING AND
IMPROVING OUR PARTY'S
PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATING PROCESS. SPECIFICALLY FOCUSING IN ON SUPERDELEGATES, CAUCUSES AND STRATEGIES FOR OPENING UP OUR
SYSTEM EVEN MORE. THE COMMISSION WILL SET UP A SET OF RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE DNC RULES AND THE BYLAWS COMMITTEE NO LATER THAN JANUARY 1, 2018. IF ADEQUATE ACTION IS NOT TAKEN WITHIN SIX MONTHS, THE
COMMISSION WILL PRESENT THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS BEFORE THE FULL DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL COMMITTEE. LET ME SHARE WITH YOU THE
PRIMARY SEASON BROUGHT TO LIGHT SOME ISSUES WE NEED TO ADDRESS
AS A DEMOCRATIC FAMILY. THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO. AS A PARTY, I BELIEVE OUR
DIVERSITY IS MADE UP STRONG. IT IS NOT REQUIRED THAT WE ALWAYS AGREE, BUT IT IS VITAL
THAT WE ALWAYS MOVE FORWARD TOGETHER.
[APPLAUSE] TO CONTINUALLY PERFECT OUR
PROCESSES AND BEGAN A MORE INCLUSIVE, FAIR AND OPEN PARTY
WITHIN EACH CYCLE.
I KNOW I SPEAK FOR A LOT OF DEMOCRATS AND PROGRESSIVES, AND
I HAVE SAID THIS ON SATURDAY, I
SAID I RESPECT AND ADMIRE SENATOR SANDERS AND HIS
CAMPAIGN.
[APPLAUSE] THE VOTERS AND CONTRIBUTORS, YOU
WERE ABLE TO MOBILIZE AND BRING
INTO THE PROCESS THE ISSUES
RAISED AND THE ELEVATION OF OUR
NATIONAL DEBATE. THERE IS NO QUESTION THE COUNTRY
IS BETTER NOW FOR YOUR EFFORTS AND AS WE GO THROUGH THE PROCESS
OF IMPROVING OUR NOMINATING PROCESS, WE WILL CONTINUE TO
MOVE OUR PARTY AND OUR COUNTRY FORWARD.
[APPLAUSE] JUST AS WE WATCHED LEBRON JAMES
AND STEPH CURRY SHAKE HANDS
AFTER A WELL THOUGHT FINALS -- FOUGHT FINALS, WE KNOW THE
COUNTRY IS EAGER TO WATC H THESE TWO GIANTS MOVE FORWARD TOGETHER
TO CHAMPION PROGRESSIVE CAUSES,
AND MOST IMPORTANTLY, TO ENSURE WE SWEAR IN A PRESIDENT COME
JANUARY WHICH WILL UPHOLD OUR IDEALS WHICH WE HOLD MOST DEAR. HILLARY CLINTON AND BERNIE
SANDERS ARE OUR CHAMPIONS. THEY BOTH DESERVE OUR CHEERS. THEY BOTH DESERVE OUR CHEERS.
[APPLAUSE] THEY BOTH DESERVE OUR CHEERS.
[APPLAUSE] I ASK YOU -- I ASK YOU -- I ASK YOU -- I ASK YOU IF YOU WOULD DO THIS FOR ME, DO THIS FOR OUR PARTY, DO THIS FOR YOU AND LET'S SHOW DONALD TRUMP WE CAN WORK
TOGETHER. CHEER FOR BERNIE WHEN HE TAKES THE STAGE. LET'S ALL CHEER FOR BERNIE
TONIGHT WHEN HE TAKES THE STAGE
AND LET'S ALSO CHEER FOR HILLARY
WHEN SHE TAKES THE STAGE ON
THURSDAY.
[APPLAUSE] WHEN WE LEAVE THIS CONVENTION, WE SHOULD DO SO WITH A UNITED SENSE OF PURPOSE TO ADVANCE OUR SHARED IDEALS AND ENSURE WHEN
OUR NEXT PRESIDENT IS SWORN IN ON JANUARY 20, WE WILL HERE FOR
THE FIRST TIME A CHIEF SUPREME COURT JUSTICE SAY THOSE WORDS,
"CONGRATULATIONS, MADAM PRESIDENT."

<strong>Diane Russell</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> MS. RUSSELL: AND I'M THE ONE WHO INTRODUCED THE FIRST AMENDMENT TO REFORM THE
SUPERDELEGATE SYSTEM.
[APPLAUSE] YOU KNOW, DUMBLEDORE FROM "HARRY POTTER"<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> ONCE SAID IT TAKES GREAT COURAGE TO STAND UP TO YOUR ENEMIES. IT TAKES EVEN GREATER COURAGE TO
STAND UP TO YOUR FRIENDS.
[APPLAUSE] OBVIOUSLY, WE'VE HAD A REAL FAMILY DISAGREEMENT OVER THE ROLE OF SUPERDELEGATES IN OUR PARTY'S NOMINATING PROCESS. WORKING TOGETHER, IT IS SUPPOSED TO BE HARD WORK, BUT WE CAN
DEFINITELY DO MORE AS A PARTY TO ENSURE A FAIRER, MORE OPEN PROCESS THAT PLACES EVERY DAY
VOTERS AT THE CENTER.
[APPLAUSE] THAT IS WHY I'M SO PLEASED TO REPORT THAT A PROCESS IS
UNDERWAY THANKS TO YOU IN SEVERAL STATES AND WITHIN OUR NEWLY FORMED UNITY REFORMS
COMMISSION TO OPEN AUP OUR
NOMINATING PROCEDURE AND BUILD A
FAIR PROCESS GOING FORWARD.
[APPLAUSE] IT IS WHAT OUR VOTERS EXPECT AND IT IS WHAT OUR PARTY DESERVES. IT'S LIKE I'M SO DEEPLY HONORED AND BEYOND GRATEFUL TO STAND HER E BEFORE YOU -- IT IS A BIT OF A
DREAM COME TRUE. ON BEHALF OF SENATOR SANDERS --
[CHEERING] ON BEHALF OF SENATOR SANDERS AND
THE POLITICAL REVOLUTION --
[CHEERING] STRONG, UNEQUIVOCAL SUPPORT TO
THE UNITY COMPROMISE. THIS PLAN, AND IT IS A PLAN, GIVES US THE OPPORTUNITY TO
CHAMPION A VARIETY OF GREAT ELECTION REFORMS, INCLUDING REDUCING THE NUMBER OF SUPERDELEGATES BY A FULL TWO-THIRDS.
[APPLAUSE] THAT IS WRITTEN RIGHT INTO THE COMMISSION CHARTER. I WANT TO BE CLEAR. WE DID NOT WIN THIS BY SELLING OUT.
[APPLAUSE] WE WON THIS BY STANDING UP.
[CHEERING] UP.
WE DID THIS.
WE WON THIS BY STANDING
TOGETHER.
[APPLAUSE]
[CROWD CHANTING] YOU'RE SO BEAUTIFUL RIGHT NOW. SINCE WE LED THE WAY IN MAINE,
RIGHT OVER THERE, DEMOCRATS IN
NEARLY 20 STATES, MOST THROUGH
THEIR LOCAL CONVENTIONS, HAVE
VOTED TO REFORM THE SUPERDELEGATE SYSTEM. 20 STATES.
[APPLAUSE] ON TOP OF THAT, MORE THAN 750,000 PROGRESSIVES SIGNED
PETITIONS CALLING FOR SERIOUS STRUCTURAL REFORMS.
[APPLAUSE] AND WE'RE DOING IT. WE ARE DOING IT BECAUSE WE ARE THE PARTY OF DEMOCRACY. WE ARE THE PARTY OF THE 99%. THE DOWNTRODDEN, THE FORGOTTEN, THE WORKING CLASS.
[APPLAUSE] EXACTLY. NOT FOR SALE.
[CROWD CHANTING "NOT FOR SALE"] WE ARE FIGHTING TO MAKE REFORM. WE WON BECAUSE DEMOCRATS FROM A
VERY SMALL BUT VERY MIGHTY STATE MADE -- THREADED A TIGHT NEEDLE TO STAND FOR REAL CHANGE
AGAINST ALL ODDS. WE WON BECAUSE DEMOCRATS ACROSS THE COUNTRY ORGANIZED IN OUR HOME STATE AND WE WON BECAUSE OUR RULES COMMITTEE MEMBERS STAYED AT THE TABLE TO
NEGOTIATE A REAL SOLUTION BECAUSE THEY HEARD YOU ASKING
FOR IT AND AMENDING IT AND THEY
-- DEMANDING IT AND THEY GOT IT
DONE.
[APPLAUSE] I NEVER THOUGHT WE WOULD GET THROUGH THE MAIN CONVENTION AND
HERE WE ARE GETTING IT THROUGH THE NATIONAL CONVENTION.
[APPLAUSE] YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND
SOMETHING. THE FIGHT TO REFORM THE SUPERDELEGATE SYSTEM WAS NEVER ABOUT THIS ELECTION. IT WAS ALWAYS ABOUT DEMOCRATIZING OUR PARTY FOR
GENERATIONS TO COME.
[APPLAUSE] IT MAY BE HARD AND, BELIEVE ME,
IT MAY BE MESSY, BUT LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, THIS IS WHAT
DEMOCRACY LOOKS LIKE!
[APPLAUSE] THIS IS WHAT DEMOCRACY LOOKS LIKE!
[APPLAUSE] IN THE END, LOVE DOES TRUMP
HATE. IN THE END, I STAND WITH MY DEMOCRATIC FAMILY IN MAKING SURE WE WIN THIS FALL.
[APPLAUSE] I DON'T NEED TO SEE ANYONE LIKE
MY GOVERNOR BECAUSE OF THIS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.
[APPLAUSE] WHETHER YOU SUPPORT BERNIE
SANDERS OR HILLARY CLINTON, WE
ARE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER AND WE
WILL ALL HAVE A VOICE IN THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION.
[CHEERING] WE CAN WORK TOGETHER ON SO MUCH. DESPITE ANY DIFFERENCES WE MAY
HOLD, WE ALL KNOW IN OUR HEART
OF HEARTS THAT A DONALD TRUMP
PRESIDENCY WILL HURT OUR PARTY
AND OUR PEOPLE, AND I AM NOT
OK WITH THAT.
[APPLAUSE] I WILL ALWAYS STAND STRONG WITH
BERNIE SANDERS. AND I WILL ALSO DO EVERYTHING I
CAN DO THIS FALL TO ELECT HILLARY SO WE HAVE A DEMOCRAT IN THE WHITE HOUSE.
[APPLAUSE] IT IS TIME TO GET TO WORK ON A
HIGHER MINIMUM WAGE, EXPANDING SOCIAL SECURITY, RESTORING EQUAL
PAY FOR WOMEN AND MAKING SURE THE REST OF THE GENERATIONS ARE NOT SADDLED WITH STUDENT DEBT LIKE MY GENERATION IS.
[APPLAUSE] WE ARE THE ROAD AHEAD. WE ARE UNITED AND FIXING THE SUPERDELEGATE SYSTEM IS THE PATH TO MAKING SURE OUR PARTY IS THE STRONGEST PARTY NOT JUST THIS FALL, BUT FOR GENERATIONS TO
COME.
THANK YOU.
