<strong>Unidentified Speaker</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> GOOD EVENING. I AM HERE TONIGHT NOT AS A DEMOCRAT OR A REPUBLICAN. I AM HERE AS A PROUD VETERAN OF
UNITED STATES ARMY AND RECIPIENT OF THE HIGHEST<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> MILITARY HONOR. SOLDIERS SPEND YEARS TRAINING FOR ONE MOMENT.
WE DON'T KNOW WHEN IT'LL WILL
CALM.
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT IT WILL REQUIRE, BUT WE KNOW WHEN IT
ARRIVES, WE WILL BE READY. MY MOMENT CAME FOUR YEARS AGO IN AFGHANISTAN.
A SUICIDE BOMBER APPROACH MY MAN
. I GRABBED HIM BY THE BACK, I THREW HIM AS FAR AS I COULD, BECAUSE AS EXACTLY AS I WAS
TRAINED TO DO. HE EXPLODED. IT TOOK PART OF MY LEG WITH IT. I WAS A RUNNER IN COLLEGE. BUT THAT WAS THE LAST RUN OF MY
LIFE. AMERICA LOST FOUR EUROS THAT
DAY.
-- HEROES THAT DAY.
MAJOR GRAY, MAJOR KERATIN, AND A
SERVICE OFFICER. I REMAINED -- REMIND YOU IN
THEIR MEMORY THAT THE MILITARY
PROTECTS YOU WITH THEIR LIVES.
[APPLAUSE] AND THAT OUR PRESIDENT SHOULD
PROTECT US IN RETURN.
[APPLAUSE] HILLARY CLINTON HAS BEEN TRAINING FOR THIS MOMENT FOR DECADES.
IN THE SENATE, SHE WORKED ACROSS THE AISLE TO SEPARATE -- SUPPORT
WARRIORS AND FAMILIES. SHE WOULD NOT PRIORITIZE THE
EDGE. SHE WILL HEAL INVISIBLE WOUNDS
THAT LEAD TO SUICIDE. AND AS COMMANDER IN CHIEF, SHE
WILL DEFEAT ISIS.
[APPLAUSE] WHEN HILLARY'S MOMENT COMES, SHE
WILL BE READY, READY TO SERVE,
READY TO LEAD, AND READY TO THANK THOSE WHO DEFEND YOU.
GOD BLESS YOU, GO ARMY.
