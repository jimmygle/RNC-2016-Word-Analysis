<strong>Leticia Van de Putte</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> GOOD AFTERNOON. I'M LETICIA VANDERPUGH, A
SEVENTH GENERATION TEXAN. MY GRANDMOTHER'SS WERE BORN IN MEXICO. THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN SO PROUD TO
SEE ME<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> STANDING HERE TODAY. COCHAIR OF THE 2016 DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL CONVENTION RULES
COMMITTEE. SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN, MY GRANDMOTHERS WOULD HAVE BEEN SO
PROUD. I ALSO REPORT. MORE THAN TWO CENTURIES AGO, A
GROUP OF COURAGEOUS INDIVIDUALS GATHERED AT INDEPENDENCE HALL, A FEW BLOCKS FROM HERE, TO GIVE BIRTH TO OUR GREAT COUNTRY AND A
GOVERNMENT OF THE PEOPLE, BY THE PEOPLE AND FOR THE PEOPLE. FOR MY GRANDMOTHERS, THEY KNEW
THAT IN THIS UNITED STATES OF
AMERICA, THE MOST MEANINGFUL TITLE THAT ANYONE COULD EVER HOLD IS THE TITLE CITIZEN.
[APPLAUSE] MY GRANDMOTHER BECAME A CITIZEN
AT AGE 68.
HER PROUDEST DAY WAS THE DAY WHEN SHE PASSED HER FIRST VOTE. AND AS DEMOCRATS, WE MUST DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO ENSURE THA
T OUR PARTY CARRIES ON THIS
TRADITION THAT MAKES US STRONGER
AS A COUNTRY. SO, WE ARE PROPOSING THE
CREATION OF THE UNITY REFORM COMMISSION. THIS COMMISSION HAS WON OVERWHELMING SUPPORT FROM ALL MEMBERS OF THE RULES COMMITTEE. AND TOGETHER, WE'RE GOING TO SEE WHAT IS WORTHY, WHAT IS NOT WORKING AND WE ARE GOING TO WORK TOGETHER TO BUILD A STRONGER
DEMOCRATIC PARTY FOR OUR
CHILDREN. AND THE COMMISSION WILL MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS REGARDING UNPLEDGED DELEGATES TO BE SURE OUR PROCESS REFLECTS OUR TRUE
DEMOCRATIC VALUES AND OUR
UNWAVERING BELIEF AND OUR REPRESENTATIVE DEMOCRACY. WE ARE GOING TO OPEN UP OUR DEMOCRATIC PROCESS SO THAT THE GRASSROOTS ALWAYS HAS A SEAT AT THE TABLE.
[APPLAUSE] WE ARE GOING TO ENSURE THAT OUR PARTY HEARS EVERY VOICE AND
EMPOWERS EVERY PERSON WITH A
CHANCE TO CONTRIBUTE. SO TO ALL THE ACTIVISTS, TO THE
ORGANIZERS, TO THE OFFICIALS AND THE VOLUNTEERS AND THE FAMILIES AND COMMUNITY LEADERS OUT THERE,
WE HEAR YOU. WE RESPECT YOU. THIS UNITY COMMISSION WILL WORK FOR YOU TO BUILD A THRIVING, GROWING DEMOCRATIC PARTY TODAY, TOMORROW AND FOR GENERATIONS TO
COME. MUCHAS GRACIAS.
