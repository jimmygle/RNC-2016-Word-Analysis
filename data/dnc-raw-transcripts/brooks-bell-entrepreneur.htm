<strong>Brooks Bell</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> HELLO DEMOCRATS. I AM A TECHNOLOGY ENTREPRENEUR
WERE FROM RALEIGH, NORTH
CAROLINA. WHEN I WAS 23 YEARS OLD, I
STARTED MY OWN COMPANY. IT WASN'T EASY.<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> SIX MONTHS LATER, I HAD A STROKE. I HAD TO RELEARN TO READ, WRITE, AND TALK. I WAS LUCKY. I RECOVERED, AND SO
DID MY FLEDGLING COMPANY. BUT THAT WAS NOT MY ONLY
STRUGGLE. IN FACT, IT WAS ONE OF MY MANY UPS AND DOWNS, FAMILIAR TO ANY
SMALL BUSINESS WITH BIG DREAMS.
I HAVE GAINED AND LOST BIG CLIENTS.
I HAVE HAD TO LET WONDERFUL EMPLOYEES GO. IT'S GIVEN ME THE START THAT I
KNOW MANY ENTREPRENEURS SHARE. I BELIEVE IN HILLARY BECAUSE I
KNOW SHE ALSO CARRIES BATTLE SCARS. HER RELENTLESS DEDICATION TO SERVE AMERICA OVER THE PAST 30 YEARS HAS BEEN MARKED BY HARD CHOICES, WHICH MAKES THIS HISTORIC ACHIEVEMENT ALL THE MORE IMPRESSIVE.
[APPLAUSE] HER TENACITY, HER TOUGHNESS,
HERB SEASONED JUDGMENT IS
EXACTLY WHAT WE NEED IN A
PRESIDENT. WE NEED SOMEBODY READY FOR THE
HARDEST JOB ON EARTH, DAY ONE. AND THAT SOMEONE IS HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON.
[APPLAUSE] TODAY MY COMPANY EMPLOYS OVER 40
PEOPLE. WE PARTNER WITH SOME OF THE
LARGEST ORGANIZATIONS IN AMERICA
TO HELP MAKE THE INTERNET EASIER
TO USE. WE ARE GROWING QUICKLY. MY COMPANY IS STRONG, AS IS MY HEALTH, THANKS IN PART TO
ONGOING INVESTMENT IN EDUCATION, HEALTH CARE, AND INNOVATION. LIKE THEY SAY, THANKS OBAMA.
[APPLAUSE] HOWEVER, I AM WORRIED, TERRIFIED ABOUT WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN IF WE ELECT TRUMP. I AM NOT JUST SCARED FOR MY BUSINESS, BUT FOR ALL THE OTHER
YOUNG ENTREPRENEURS LIKE ME. WE HAVE ALREADY SEEN THE PREVIEW IN MY OWN STATE OF NORTH CAROLINA. EARLIER THIS YEAR, OUR
LEGISLATURE PASSED WHAT IS KNOWN
AS THE BATHROOM BILL.
[BOOS] WHICH CAUSED THE NEW YORK TIMES TO DESCRIBE NORTH CAROLINA AS "A TINIER -- A PIONEER IN BIGOTRY."
BESIDES BEING DEEPLY
EMBARRASSING AND MORALLY WRONG,
IT HAD AN IMMEDIATE AND DRAMATIC AFFECT ON OUR STATE ON OUR STATE ECONOMY.
I WATCHED A LARGE COMPANY CANCEL THEIR EXPANSION, TAKING 400 GOOD JOBS WITH THEM.
TWO INFLUENTIAL TECHNOLOGY
INVESTORS IMMEDIATELY BANNED
INVESTMENT IN OUR STATE. THE NBA JUST PULLED THE ALL-STAR GAME OUT OF TOWN:.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
BROOKS: THE TOTAL ECONOMIC COSTS
IS ALREADY $190 MILLION AND
COUNTING.
WHAT DOES THIS HAVE TO DO WITH
TRUMP? FOR STARTERS, TRUMP SELECTED
MIKE PENCE AS HIS RUNNING MATE.
THE SAME MIKE PENCE WHO SIGNED A
DISCRIMINATORY BILL INTO INDIANA LAW WITH SIMILAR DISASTROUS CONSEQUENCES. IT'S NO SURPRISE THAT ECONOMISTS
HAVE LISTED A TRUMP PRESIDENCY AS ONE OF THE TOP 10 RISKS TO THE WORLD ECONOMY.
FRIENDS, I'M HERE TONIGHT
BECAUSE THE STORY OF MY START-UP IS THE STORY OF AMERICA, BECAUSE HOW WE WRITE OUR NEXT CHAPTER IS
UP TO US. PLEASE JOIN ME IN STANDING UP
FOR AN INCLUSIVE COUNTRY WITH
INNOVATION AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP
FUELING OUR ECONOMIC PROSPERITY! LET'S PUT HILLARY CLINTON WHERE
WE NEED HER THE MOST, AS
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA! THANK YOU!
