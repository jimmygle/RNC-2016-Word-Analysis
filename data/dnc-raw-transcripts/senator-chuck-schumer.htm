<strong>Jimmy Carter</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> GOOD EVENING, DEMOCRATS. 46 YEARS AGO, I STOOD BEFORE YOU TO ACCEPT YOUR NOMINATION AS
PRESIDENT. WE WISH WE COULD BE THERE
TONIGHT TO HELP PREPARE<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> FOR WHAT WILL BE AN EXTREMELY IMPORTANT ELECTION, ONE THAT WILL DEFINE FOR A GENERATION WHO WE ARE AS A
NATION AND A PEOPLE.
I FEEL PROUD THAT OUR TWO DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES, WHO
COMPETED THROUGHOUT A LONG PRIMARY SEASON, COMPORTED THEMSELVES WITH MIDI, TALKED ABOUT ISSUES THAT MATTER, AND
PRESENTED A VISION -- WITH DIGNITY, TALKED ABOUT ISSUES
THAT MATTER, AND PRESENTED A
VISION FOR OUR NATION.
YOUNG AMERICANS, STAY ENGAGED, THEY INVOLVED, AND BE SURE TO
VOTE THIS NOVEMBER. IT HAS BECOME MORE IMPORTANT
THAN EVER TO LIFT PEOPLE UP TO A BRIGHTER FUTURE. INSTEAD, WE SEE A REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE WHO SEEMS TO REJECT THE MORAL AND ETHICAL
PRINCIPLES ON WHICH OUR NATION
WAS FOUNDED.
WE CAN AND MUST DO BETTER. WE WILL SOON BE CHOOSING
BETWEEN STARK CONTRASTS IN STYLE
AND EXPERIENCE.
I HAVE KNOWN HILLARY CLINTON FOR DECADES. WHEN SHE WAS A YOUNG ATTORNEY, I
APPOINTED HER TO THE LEGAL
SERVICES CORPORATION, WHERE SHE
BECAME THE FIRST WOMAN CHAIR. THERE, HILLARY FOUGHT TO MAKE
SURE THAT IN OUR COURTS, THOSE
WITH THE LEAST WERE TREATED THE
SAME AS THOSE WITH THE MOST. SINCE THEN, HILLARY HAS ALWAYS DEMONSTRATED A WILLINGNESS TO TAKE ON DIFFICULT CHALLENGES AND TO GET THINGS DONE.
HER LIFE HAS BEEN DEDICATED TO
ADVANCING HUMAN RIGHTS ACROSS THE GLOBE, ESPECIALLY FOR WOMEN
AND CHILDREN. THESE ARE PERILOUS TIMES, THAT NEED SOMEONE WITH A STRONG
HEART, A DEEP UNDERSTANDING OF ISSUES, AND A STRONG HAND.
-- AND A STEADY HAND. HILLARY CLINTON HAS MY SUPPORT,
AND I KNOW SHE HAS YOURS. THANK YOU ALL, AND GOD BLESS THE
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.
>> PLEASE WELCOME SENATOR CHUCK SCHUMER FROM NEW YORK.

<strong>Chuck Schumer</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> SENATOR SCHUMER: HELLO, NEW
YORK, I LOVE YOU. NOW, THERE IS A STATUE IN THE
HARBOR OF THE CITY I REPRESENT,
A MIGHTY WOMAN WITH A TORCH. TO ME, THAT TORCH<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> REPRESENTS THE AMERICAN DREAM, AND IF YOU ASK THE AVERAGE AMERICAN WHAT THAT
DREAM MEANS TO THEM, THEY PUT IT SIMPLY, NOT IN FANCY LANGUAGE.
THEY SAY IF I WORK HARD, I WILL
BE DOING BETTER 10 YEARS FROM NOW THAN I AM DOING TODAY, AND MY KIDS WILL BE DOING STILL BETTER THAN ME. EACH GENERATION MUST KEEP THAT
TORCH BURNING

IT'S THE SOURCE OF OUR OPTIMISM.
PRESIDENT OBAMA FOUGHT EVERY DAY TO DEFEND FUNDAMENTAL AMERICAN
HOMES BUT WE HAVE MORE WORK TO DO.
MIDDLE-CLASS INCOME HAS NOT
GROWN ENOUGH.
TOO MANY FAMILIES STRUGGLE TO
MAKE ENDS MEET AND IF THAT CONTINUES, THE TORCH WILL
FLICKER. ITS POWER TO INSPIRE HOPE WILL DIM.
SOME ARE USING THIS UNEASE TO PIT AMERICANS AGAINST EACH OTHER
. NOT US. WE DEMOCRATS FIGHT FOR AN
AMERICA THAT WORKS FOR EVERYONE, THAT IS FOCUSED ON LEVELING THE
PLAYING FIELD FOR ALL OF US, AND WHEN HILLARY CLINTON WITH THE WHITE HOUSE AND DEMOCRATS WIN BACK THE SENATE MAJORITY, THAT
IS JUST WHAT WE WILL DO. MY FRIEND HILLARY UNDERSTANDS
WHAT MIDDLE-CLASS FAMILIES NEED
BETTER THAN ANYONE. I KNOW BECAUSE I KNOW HILLARY.
I WORKED BY HER SIDE FOR EIGHT
YEARS. I'M FROM BROOKLYN. IT'S IN OUR BLOOD TO SNIFF OUT
BULL. THERE'S A LOT OF THAT IN
POLITICS BUT NOT IN HILLARY. WHEN SHE TELLS YOU SOMETHING,
TAKE IT TO THE BANK. SHE HAS A REMARKABLE ABILITY TO INTERNALIZE THE FEARS AND HOPES AND DREAMS OF EVERYDAY AMERICANS AND WORK HARD AND GET THINGS
DONE FOR THEM. SHE LISTNED TO THE FACTORY
WORKER WORRIED SICK THAT IS
COMPANY WAS LEAVING TOWN. SHE READ THE CORPORATIONS THE
RIOT ACT UNTIL THEY AGREE TO KEEP THE PLANT OPEN. SHE LISTENED TO THE UNION WORKERS AND FIRST RESPONDERS WHO
RUSHED TO THE PILE AFTER THAT
TERRIBLE DAY IN 9/11 THAT WERE
SEARCHING FOR SIGNS OF LIFE IN
THE SMOLDERING RUBBLE, BREATHING IN TOXIC FUMES. SHE CHAMPIONED THEIR CAUSE,
FOUGHT TO GET THEM THE HEALTH
CARE THEY DESERVED, AND THEY GOT
IT. THAT IS THE KIND OF LEADERSHIP THIS COUNTRY NEEDS AND THE
STAKES COULD NOT BE HIGHER. MOST ELECTIONS ARE ABOUT TWO
DIFFERENT VISIONS OR AMERICA. THIS ELECTION IS ABOUT TWO DIFFERENT VISIONS OF AMERICA. DONALD TRUMP CAN ONLY SEE AN
ANGRY AMERICA, CLOSED TO THE
WORLD AND SUSPICIOUS OF OUR
FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS. HILLARY SEES A DIFFERENT AMERICA, AN AMERICA THAT STRIVES TO LIVE UP TO THE PROMISE
WRITTEN HERE IN PHILADELPHIA THAT EVERY MAN, EVERY WOMAN HAS A RIGHT TO LIFE, LIBERTY, AND THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS. IN AMERICA WHERE WE BREAKDOWN BARRIERS, SHATTER CEILINGS. THAT'S BECAUSE OUR DIFFERENCES MAKE US STRONGER, STRONGER TOGETHER. SO HILLARY CLINTON HAS THE RIGHT
VISION OF AND FOR AMERICA BUT MY COLLEAGUE, WE CANNOT DO IT ALONE.
SHE IS GOING TO NEED A MAJORITY IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE. IT WILL PROTECT WOMEN'S RIGHTS, VOTING RIGHTS, AND UNDO THAT AWFUL DECISION, CITIZENS UNITED. A SENATE MAJORITY THAT WILL
RAISE THE MINIMUM WAGE, ENSURE
EQUAL PAY FOR WOMEN THAT WILL
PASS COMPREHENSIVE IMMIGRATION REFORM, MAKE SUBSTANTIAL
INVESTMENTS IN INFRASTRUCTURE, GIVE EVERY STUDENT A SHOT AT
AFFORDING A COLLEGE EDUCATION, AND THE CHANGES ARE TRADE POLICY
SO IT DOESN'T REPRESENT
CORPORATE AMERICA THAT THE
AVERAGE AMERICAN. WHEN HILLARY AS PRESIDENT AND A
STRONG SENATE MAJORITY, WE WILL KEEP THAT AMERICAN DREAM ALIVE AND THAT TORCH IN THE HARBOR OF
THE CITY IN WHICH I LIVE WILL FLICKER, IT WON'T FADE, IT WILL BURN BRIGHTLY IN THE HEARTS OF EVERY AMERICAN. THANK YOU, GOD BLESS YOU, AND
GOD BLESS AMERICA.
[APPLAUSE]

<strong>Elizabeth Banks</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> IT'S CERTAINLY AN INCONVENIENCE FOR A BUSINESS.
(music)
>> I DON'T USUALLY SAY THIS
ABOUT DONALD TRUMP, BUT THAT WAS OVER THE TOP. I CONFIRMED IT JUST<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> NOW. CITRON -- I JUST BOUGHT THAT FOG
MACHINE ON EBAY FOR $30. I DON'T FEEL GOOD ABOUT IT, I
DON'T. WHO IS PUMPED UP?
[CHEERS] WHO IS EXCITED TO POUND A DOZEN CHEESESTEAKS WITH ME AFTER THIS?
[CHEERS] LET'S TRY THAT AGAIN. WHO IS READY TO ELECT HILLARY
CLINTON THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF
THE UNITED STATES?
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] ME TOO. I'M ELIZABETH BANKS. SOME OF YOU KNOW ME FROM THE
HUNGER GAMES IN WHICH I PLAY ETSIE TRINKET, A CRUEL, OUT OF
TOUCH REALITY TV STAR WHO WEARS INSANE WAKES WHILE LIVING IN A
VIOLENT DYSTOPIA. WHEN I WENT TO CLEVELAND LAST
WEEK I WAS LIKE HEY, THAT'S MY
ACT.
[APPLAUSE] PART OF ME REALLY LIKES BEING A
PEER AND JOKING AROUND BUT THE
OTHER PART OF ME KNOWS THIS
ELECTION IS TOO IMPORTANT FOR JOKES BECAUSE WHEN I THINK ABOUT
WHAT THIS ELECTION MEANS FOR
AMERICA I INC. ABOUT MY FAMILY. MY FATHER, THE VIETNAM VET,
MAYBE I CAN AND THIRD SHIFTS IN PITTSFIELD, MASSACHUSETTS. MY MOTHER WORKED AT THE LIBRARY AND LOCAL BANK AND THEY WORKED HARD.
THEY STRUGGLED BECAUSE LIKE
MILLIONS OF AMERICAN PARENTS, THEY WANTED TO GIVE THEIR KIDS,
FOUR OF US, A GOOD LIFE WITH
BOUNDLESS OPPORTUNITIES. AND IT IS BECAUSE OF WHAT
DEMOCRATS BUILT, GOOD PUBLIC SCHOOLS, AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE,
HELP IN THE HARDEST TIMES, THAT THEY WERE ABLE TO DO THAT.
THEIR DREAMS TOOK ME HERE TO
PHILADELPHIA, REALLY. THROUGH SCHOLARSHIPS AND FINANCIAL AID, I WORKED MY WAY TO THE UNIVERSITY OF
PENNSYLVANIA. I GOT A WORLD-CLASS EDUCATION
AND I MET MY WONDERFUL HUSBAND AND PARTNER, MAX.
I WILL NEVER FORGET THAT DAY IN
1992 WHEN WE WENT ON A BIG, ROMANTIC DATE, A RALLY FOR BILL
CLINTON. AND IT WAS THERE THAT I LEARNED SOMETHING REALLY IMPORTANT ABOUT
SHOW BUSINESS. THE HEADLINER SHOULD ALWAYS
WATCH OUT FOR SOMEONE STEALING
THE SHOW. HILLARY CLINTON ROCKED MY WORLD. A SMART, COMMITTED, SUCCESSFUL WOMEN AND NOT FOR HER OWN BENEFIT BUT A FIGHTER FOR WOMEN AND CHILDREN, COPS AND FIRST RESPONDERS, HEALTH CARE AND
GIRLS AROUND THE WORLD, THAT IS
HILLARY CLINTON AND THAT IS WHAT
TONIGHT IS ALL ABOUT, THE FIGHTS
OF HER LIFE. DID YOU KNOW THAT WHEN HILLARY CLINTON GRADUATED LAW SCHOOL, SHE DIDN'T JUST SELL OUT AND
WORK FOR SOME FANCY LAW FIRM, SHE WENT TO WORK ADVOCATING FOR CHILDREN AND FAMILIES.
IT WAS ONE OF HER FIRST FIGHTS AND SINCE THEN, SHE HAS NEVER LET UP.
