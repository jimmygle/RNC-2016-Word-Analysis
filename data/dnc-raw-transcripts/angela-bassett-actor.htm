<p class='short_transcript'> >> THANK YOU. THEY WERE GATHERED TO PRAY. HE WALKS IN, AN OUTSIDER, A
STRANGER AND THEY WELCOMED HIM. THEN, HE OPENED FIRE. HE STOLE THEIR LIVES. REVEREND<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> SAYS -- TAIWAN SANDERS. SUSIE JACKSON. DANIEL SIMMONS. MIDDLETON. SAY THEIR NAMES. THAT IS NOT ENOUGH.
>> NO!
>> SINCE THE MASSACRE AT CHARLESTON CHURCH, MORE LIVES
HAVE BEEN DESTROYED BY GUN
VIOLENCE. AND HATRED STILL THREATENS TO
TEAR US APART. AFTER CHARLESTON, HILLARY CLINTON CHALLENGED ALL OF US TO TURN OUR GRIEF INTO ACTION AND
WE HAVE TO DO THAT. THERE ARE DAYS WHEN IT FEELS
LIKE OUR BODIES AND OUR MINDS
ARE UNDER TOO MUCH PRESSURE. THEN I REMEMBER THAT WE HAVE -- I THINK GOD THAT OUR SOULS ARE
ON FIRE. I VISITED CHARLESTON THIS YEAR.
I CAN TELL YOU THAT THAT CITY'S SOUL IS ON FIRE. THAT SOUL BURNS WITH RESILIENCE.
IT FUELS THE RESISTANCE. IT BROUGHT DOWN THE CONFEDERATE FLAG --
[CHEERS] AND IT BRINGS THE TRUSTING COMMUNITY TOGETHER CLOSER
EVERYDAY. WE ARE HONORED TO HAVE CHARLESTON SURVIVORS, FELICIA SANDERS AND PAUL SHEPHERD HERE
WITH US TONIGHT.
PLEASE JOIN ME IN WELCOMING
THEM.

<p class='short_transcript'> >> GOOD EVENING. WE MEAN YOU NO HARM, THE LAST
WORDS. MY HERO. I GAVE -- TWO DAYS LATER I
FORGET THE SHOOTER. I REFUSE TO LATE HATE DESTROY ME
-- LET<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> HATE DESTROY ME.
[CHEERS] I HAVE ASKED, HOW WAS HE ABLE TO PURCHASE THE GUN HE USED TO KILL SO MANY? AFTER THAT DAY, HILLARY CLINTON CALLED ON LAWMAKERS TO CLOSE THE
CHARLESTON LOOPHOLE.
[CHEERS] BECAUSE, EVEN THOUGH THE SHOOTER
HAD AN ARREST RECORD, AS THE DAYS PASSED, HE COULD STILL BUY
THE GUN. NO ONE SHOULD FEEL WHAT I HAVE
SEEN. NO ONE SHOULD FEEL HOW WE FEEL. HOW WE SUFFERED. THE BIBLE TELLS US THAT PRAY AND TURN FROM OUR WICKED WAYS. GOD WILL FORGIVE US AND HEAL OUR
LAND. LET US HE'D GOD'S WORD AND IN
TURN, MAY GOD HEAL</span><span class='hidden-full-transcript-ellipses'>...</span></p><a href='#' class='hidden-full-transcript-link'><i class='icon-chevron-down'></i> <span class='link-show-full-text'>Show Full Text</span><i class='icon-chevron-up'></i> <span class='link-show-less-text'>Show Less Text</span></a>
