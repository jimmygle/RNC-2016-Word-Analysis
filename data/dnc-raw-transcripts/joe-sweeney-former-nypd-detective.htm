A  W

A  W

OF  W

I  W
CHANCES  W

AT  W

THAT  W

ALL  W

SIX  W
PEOPLE  W
WHO
 W
WERE  W
KILLED.

TO  W

I  W
FOUGHT  W

YOUNG  W
SON,  W
10  W
MONTHS  W

AT  W
THE

HILLARY  W

STOOD  W
WITH  W

THROUGH  W

IN  W
THE
 W
DARKEST  W
OF  W

IN  W

HARDEST  W
OF  W

THE  W

WHO
 W
SHOW  W
UP  W
IN  W
YOUR  W
LIFE  W
ARE  W
THE
 W
ONES  W
THAT  W
MEAN  W
EVERYTHING.
 W
HILLARY  W
SHOWED  W
UP. SHE WALKED INTO MY HOSPITAL ROOM
AND SHE TOOK MY BANDAGED HAND
INTO HER OWN. OUR CONNECTION WASN'T BETWEEN A
SENATOR AND A CONSTITUENT, IT
WAS PERSON TO PERSON, AND DOES A
WOMAN WORKING IN BUSINESS FOR
YEARS, I KNOW -- AND AS A WOMAN WORKING IN BUSINESS FOR YEARS, I KNOW HOW TO BE TOUGH, AND IN THAT WOMAN IS A HELL OF A TOUGH
PERSON. FOR YEARS SHE VISITED, CALLED,
AND CONTINUES TO CHECK IN, BECAUSE HILLARY CARES.
WHEN I NEEDED HER, SHE WAS
THERE. WHEN OUR FIRST RESPONDERS NEEDED
HER, SHE WAS THERE.
WHEN NEW YORK NEEDED HER, SHE
WAS THERE. I TRUSTED HER WHEN MY LIFE WAS
ON THE LINE, AND SHE CAME
THROUGH, NOT FOR THE CAMERAS, NOT BECAUSE ANYONE WAS WATCHING,
BUT BECAUSE THAT'S WHO SHE IS, KIND, CARING, LOYAL. SHE HAD MY BACK. THIS IS THE HILLARY CLINTON I
WANT YOU TO KNOW.
SHE WAS THERE FOR ME AND THAT IS WHY I'M WITH HER.
