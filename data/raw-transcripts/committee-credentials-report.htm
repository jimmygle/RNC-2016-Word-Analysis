<strong>Robert "Mike" M. Duncan</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> MR. DUNCAN: IT HAS BEEN A GREAT
PRIVILEGE TO SERVE AS CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMITTEE ALONG WITH MY
COCHAIRMAN AND THE VICE
CHAIRMAN. RICHARD PORTER ILLINOIS,<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> JEANNIE OF MISSISSIPPI, JULIE ON
BERGERON OF NEW HAMPSHIRE, JIM DICKIE OF OHIO, STEVE PRICE OF RHODE ISLAND, GLENN OF SOUTH CAROLINA, AND FREDDIE SIMPSON OF
WASHINGTON. REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE IS MEANT TO CONSIDER CONTEST
ORIGINATING FROM THE STATE OF COLORADO AND ILLINOIS.
THE COMMITTEE ISSUED
RECOMMENDATIONS WHICH WERE
SUBMITTED TO THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE ON JULY 11,
2016. THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL
COMMITTEE ADOPTED THE COMMITTEE CONTEST RECOMMENDATIONS WHICH WERE INCORPORATED INTO THE TEMPORARY ROLE AND FORWARDED TO
THE TEMPORARY CONVENTION COMMITTEE ON CREDENTIALS. TWO APPEALS FROM THE STATE OF CORAL COLORADO AND THE DISTRICT
OF COLUMBIA WERE TAKEN BEFORE THIS MIDI.
IN THE COLORADO CONTEST OF THE
CREDENTIALS COMMITTEE ADOPTED
REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE'S RECOMMENDATION TO SEE THE
CONTESTED AT-LARGE DELEGATE AND
ALTERNATE DELEGATES. IN THE MANNER IN WHICH THE COLORADO REPUBLICAN COMMITTEE SELECTED ITS NATIONAL CONVENTION DELEGATES AT LARGE AND ALTERNATES WAS HARDLY A MODEL OF EXCELLENCE AND ELECTION ADMINISTRATION. THE COMMITTEE HAS SERIOUS CONCERNS REGARDING THE CHOSEN BALLOTING PROCESS. THE COMMITTEE SUGGESTS THE STATE
PARTY EVALUATE THEIR PROCESS AND MAKE ADJUSTMENTS TO PREVENT SIMILAR BALLOTING IRREGULARITIES
IN THE FUTURE.
[APPLAUSE] THE COMMITTEE EXERCISES THIS
DISCRETION TO FASHION THE
EQUITABLE REMEDY DESIGNED TO
RENDER A JUST RESULT FOR THE PARTIES PROVIDED WITH CONTESTANTS WITH GUEST PASSES SO THAT ALTHOUGH NOT ATTENDING AS DELEGATES, THAT THEY CAN BE PART
OF THIS GREAT CONVENTION. IN A DISTRICT OF KUMBAYA
CONTEST, THE CREDENTIALS COMMITTEE DID NOT ADOPT THE
REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE'S RECOMMENDATION, AND INSTEAD
DECIDED TO SEEK THE CONTESTED AT-LARGE DELEGATES. THE COMMITTEE VOTED TO UPHOLD
THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA
REPUBLICAN PARTY DETERMINATION
THAT THE CONTESTING DELEGATE WAS NOT A RESIDENT OF D.C. AND THEREFORE NOT QUALIFIED TO SERVE
AS A NATIONAL CONVENTION DELEGATE. MR. CHAIRMAN, I MOVE THE
ADOPTION OF THE RESOLUTION AND
YIELD BACK THE BALANCE OF OUR
TIME.</span><span class='hidden-full-transcript-ellipses'>...</span></p><a href='#' class='hidden-full-transcript-link'><i class='icon-chevron-down'></i> <span class='link-show-full-text'>Show Full Text</span><i class='icon-chevron-up'></i> <span class='link-show-less-text'>Show Less Text</span></a>
