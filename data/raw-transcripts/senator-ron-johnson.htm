<strong>Ron Johnson</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> SEN. JOHNSON: WHAT DIFFERENCE AT
THIS POINT DOESN'T MAKE?
I AM THE GUY THAT GOT UNDER HER SKIN AND PROVOKE THAT INFAMOUS
RESPONSE FROM HILLARY CLINTON<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> BY ASKING A SIMPLE QUESTION, WHY
DID YOU NOT JUST PICK UP THE
PHONE AND CALL THE SURVIVORS?
BUT INSTEAD OF DOING THAT, SHE
HAS TO COVER UP STORY AND REPEATEDLY LIED TO THE AMERICAN
PEOPLE. SHE EVEN LIGHT TO THE -- LIED TO
THE FAMILY MEMBERS OF AMERICANS
FALLEN HEROES.
THINK ABOUT THAT FOR A MOMENT. SHE LOOKED THOSE FAMILY MEMBERS
RIGHT IN THE EYE, THEN SHE LIED. OF COURSE HILLARY'S COLD
CALCULATED LINE CONTINUES. IF WE CAN'T TRUST HER TO TELL US THE TRUTH, HOW CAN WE POSSIBLY
TRUST HER TO LEAD AMERICA?
[APPLAUSE] SO LET ME TELL YOU WHAT DIFFERENCE IT DOES MAKE WHEN AMERICA'S LEADERS CANNOT BE TRUSTED, AND WHEN OUR COMMANDER IN CHIEF FAILS MISERABLY BY EMPLOYING A STRATEGY OF PEACE THROUGH WITHDRAWAL INSTEAD OF
ACHIEVING PEACE THROUGH
STRENGTH. IT MADE A DIFFERENCE TO THE
YOUNG USING THE WOMAN -- YOUNG YAZIDI WOMAN THAT WAS BRUTALIZED BY ISIS BARBARIANS. THE JOY OF LIFE HAUNTINGLY ABSENT IN HER EYES. IT MADE A DIFFERENCE TO THE TRAVELERS PASSING THROUGH
AIRPORTS IN BRUSSELS, ISTANBUL,
WHO JUST WANTED TO GET HOME TO
THE FAMILY IN FRANCE.
IT MADE A DIFFERENCE TO THE ORDINARY AMERICANS SHARING HOW THEY CHEER AT A CHRISTMAS PARTY. IT MADE A DIFFERENCE TO THE
YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN DANCING ON A SUMMER NIGHT AT A CLUB IN
ORLANDO. AND IT MADE A DIFFERENCE TO THE
FAMILIES WATCHING FIREWORKS AT THE CELEBRATION OF FREEDOM IN NICE. THESE ARE JUST A FEW OF THE EXAMPLES OF ISLAMIC TERRORISTS. LET ME REPEAT THAT, RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISTS.
[APPLAUSE] SLAUGHTERING AND BRUTALIZING
THEIR INNOCENT VICTIMS. SO THE QUESTION IS, WHEN WILL AMERICA ACTUALLY CONFRONT THIS
TERRIBLE REALITY? WE CERTAINLY WANT IF DEMOCRATS WIN IN  NOVEMBER. IN WISCONSIN, I AM RUNNING
AGAINST RUSS FEINGOLD, A MAN WHO
EVEN AFTER 9/11, WAS THE ONLY
SENATOR TO VOTE AGAINST GIVING
LAW ENFORCEMENT THE TOOLS THEY
NEED TO HELP STOP INTERNATIONAL
TERROR. DURING HIS 18 YEAR SENATE
CAREER, HE ALSO VOTED AGAINST AUTHORIZING THE MILITARY 11
SEPARATE TIMES. HE IS ASKING WISCONSINITES TO
GIVE HIM A FOURTH TERM. JUST AS HILLARY CLINTON IS
ASKING AMERICA TO GIVE HER OBAMAS FIRST TERM.
-- THIRD TERM. THE WORLD IS SIMPLY TOO
DANGEROUS TO ELECT EITHER OF
THEM. INSTEAD, AMERICA NEEDS STRONG
LEADERSHIP. LEADERS WHO WILL JUMPSTART OUR
ECONOMY, SECURE OUR BORDERS,
STRENGTHEN OUR MILITARY AND
ACCOMPLISH THE GOAL THAT PRESIDENT OBAMA SET OUT OVER 22 MONTHS AGO -- WE MUST DEFEAT
ISIS. AND WE MUST REMAIN FULLY
COMMITTED TO DESTROYING ISLAMIC TERRORIST WHEREVER THEY HIDE.
[APPLAUSE] IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE LIKE THIS. WE SHOULD NOT HAVE TO LIVE IN FEAR. BUT IF WE WANT TO CHANGE THAT
REALITY, WE MUST UNDERSTAND
EXACTLY WHAT IS AT TAKE. THIS IS A FIGHT FOR FREEDOM.
THIS IS NOT SOMEBODY ELSE'S FIGHT.
THIS IS OUR FIGHT AND IT IS OUR
FIGHT THAT WE ABSOLUTELY MUST WIN.
[APPLAUSE] DONALD TRUMP AND MIKE PENCE
UNDERSTAND THAT THESE MUST BE
AMERICA'S TOP PRIORITIES. THEY WILL BE STRONG LEADERS
WORKING WITH REPUBLICANS IN THE
HOUSE AND THE SENATE TO ACHIEVE A GOAL THAT CAN UNITE US ALL.
A SAFE, A PROSPEROUS AND SECURE
AMERICA.
OUR FUTURE HANGS IN THE BALANCE.
WE MUST UNIFY, WORK TIRELESSLY,
AND TOGETHER, SAVE THIS GREAT
NATION.
SO GOD BLESS YOUR RELEASED FROM PRISON EARLY
BECAUSE OF SOME POLITICIAN WANTED TO SHOW THEIR COMPASSION. WHAT IS SHE GOING TO DO? SHE WILL DIAL 911 AND PRAY. THE POLICE WILL DO THEIR BEST TO
GET THERE QUICKLY, BUT THEIR
AVERAGE RESPONSE TIME IS 11
MINUTES. SO THE QUESTION IS, SHOULD SHE
BE ABLE TO DEFEND YOURSELF WITH
A FIREARM IN HER OWN HOME? OF COURSE. FRIENDS, THAT QUESTION IS ON THE BALLOT IN NOVEMBER.
AND HERE IS WHY. EIGHT YEARS AGO THE SUPREME
COURT RULED THAT WE HAVE A
FUNDAMENTAL INDIVIDUAL RIGHT TO
PROTECT OURSELVES AND OUR FAMILIES WITH A FIREARM IN OUR
OWN HOMES. THEY SHOULD HAVE ROLLED IT 9-0, BUT THE SECOND AMENDMENT SURVIVED BY JUST ONE VOTE. AFTER JUSTICE SCALIA'S DEATH,
THAT VOTE IS GONE. IN CASE YOU'RE ARE WONDERING WHERE HILLARY CLINTON STANDS, SHE SAID "THE SUPREME COURT IS WRONG ON THE SECOND AMENDMENT." THINK ABOUT THAT. ON THE SUPREME COURT SAID WAS
THAT YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO
PROTECT YOUR LIFE AND YOUR OWN
HOME, BUT HILLARY SAYS THEY ARE
WRONG. IT IS THAT SIMPLE. A HILLARY CLINTON SUPREME COURT MEANS YOUR RIGHT TO OWN A
FIREARM IS GONE. MAKE NO MISTAKE, THIS ELECTION
IS NOT ABOUT THE NEXT FOUR YEARS
. IT'S ABOUT THE NEXT 40 YEARS. VOTING FOR HILLARY CLINTON OR
NOT VOTING IS SIMPLY NOT AN
OPTION. WHAT IS SO OUTRAGEOUS IS THAT
FOR THE REST OF HER LIFE, HILLARY CLINTON WILL NEVER EVEN
THINK ABOUT DIALING 911. FOR THE PAST 30 YEARS, SHE HAS
NOT TAKEN A WALK, A NAP, FOR A BATHROOM BREAK WITHOUT A GOOD
GUY WITH A GUN TO PROTECT HER.
[APPLAUSE] IT IS EASY FOR HER TO DISMISS A
RIGHT THAT YOU WILL NEVER HAVE
TO USE. FOR THE REST OF US, THE CHOICE
TO OWN A FIREARM IS OURS TO MAKE
. IN AMERICA THERE CANNOT BE ONE
SET OF RULES FOR THE CLINTONS
AND ANOTHER SET FOR US. HERE IS HILLARY'S PROBLEM,
AMERICAN WOMEN ARE THE FASTEST
GROWING GROUP OF GUN OWNERS.
[APPLAUSE] MILLIONS OWN FIREARMS AND
MILLIONS MORE ARE THINKING ABOUT
IT. IT'S NOT HILLARY CLINTON SAYS WOMEN SHOULD HAVE THAT CHOICE, IT IS DONALD TRUMP. DONALD TRUMP IS A MEMBER OF THE
NATIONAL RIFLE ASSOCIATION'S, SO
ARE HIS SONS. WE ARE THE LARGEST AND OLDEST CIVIL RIGHTS ORGANIZATION IN
AMERICA.
[APPLAUSE]
[LAUGHTER] WE FIGHT FOR THE RIGHTS OF ALL AMERICANS, REGARDLESS OF RACE, RELIGION, OR SEXUAL ORIENTATION. BECAUSE THE RIGHT TO PROTECT YOUR LIFE IS THE MOST PRECIOUS RIGHT YOU HAVE. FRIENDS, THE 5 MILLION WHEN AND
WOMEN OF THE NRA WILL FIGHT WITHOUT APOLOGY FOR YOUR RIGHT TO PROTECT HER LIFE. WE ARE ON THE CUSP OF LOSING
THIS GREAT AMERICAN FREEDOM AND WITH IT, THIS GREAT NATION. THE ONLY WAY WE SAVE IT, THE
ONLY WAY IS BY ELECTING DONALD TRUMP, THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE
UNITED STATES. THANK YOU AND GOD BLESS YOU.
