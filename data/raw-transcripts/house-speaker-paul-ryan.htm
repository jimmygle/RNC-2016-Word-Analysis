<strong>Paul D. Ryan</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> SPEAKER RYAN: HEY EVERYBODY. THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH. HI WISCONSIN. DELEGATES, FRIENDS, FELLOW CITIZENS, I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW
MUCH I APPRECIATE THE PRIVILEGE
OF<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> ADDRESSING THIS 41ST CONVENTION OF THE PARTY OF
LINCOLN. AND AS PART OF MY GERMAN DUTIES, LET ME -- CHAIRMAN DUTIES, LET ME THANK EVERYBODY OF THIS
BEAUTIFUL CITY FOR LOOKING AFTER US THIS WEEK.
[APPLAUSE] AND ABOVE ALL, I WANT TO THANK
THE MEN AND WOMEN THAT ARE HERE
FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT FOR YOUR
SERVICE.
[APPLAUSE] STANDING UP HERE AGAIN, IT HAS A FAMILIAR FEEL. STUDENTS OF TRIVIA WILL RECALL
THAT LAST TIME AROUND I WAS YOUR
NOMINEE FOR VICE PRESIDENT.
IT WAS A GREAT HONOR. IT WAS A GREAT HONOR EVEN IF
THINGS DIDN'T WORK OUT QUITE
ACCORDING TO THE PLAN. HEY, I AM A POSITIVE GUY. I FOUND SOME OTHER THINGS TO
KEEP ME BUSY. I LIKE TO LOOK AT IT THIS WAY. THERE IS A STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS, I DON'T KNOW WHERE JOE
BIDEN OR BARACK OBAMA ARE GOING
TO BE, BUT YOU WILL FIND ME
THERE RIGHT ON THE ROSTER WHEN
VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE AND
PRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP--
[APPLAUSE]
[CHANTING "TRUMP"] SPEAKER RYAN: DEMOCRACY IS A
SERIES OF CHOICES. WE REPUBLICANS HAVE MADE OUR CHOICE. HAVE WE HAD OUR ARGUMENTS THIS
YEAR? SURE WE HAVE. YOU AND I CALL THOSE SIGNS OF
LIFE. SIGNS OF A PARTY THAT IS NOT
JUST GOING THROUGH THE MOTIONS, NOT JUST MOUTHING THE WORDS FROM
THE SAME OLD STUFF. MEANWHILE, WHAT CHOICE HAS THE
OTHER PARTY MADE IN THIS
INCREDIBLE YEAR FILLED WITH SO
MANY SURPRISES?
HERE WE ARE AT A TIME WHEN MEN
AND WOMEN IN BOTH PARTIES SO CLEARLY, SO UNDENIABLY WANT A
BIG CHANGE IN DIRECTION FOR
AMERICA?
A CLEAN BREAK FROM A FAILED SYSTEM. WHAT DOES THE DEMOCRATIC ESTABLISHMENT OFFER? WHAT IS THEIR IDEA OF A CLEAN BREAK? THEY ARE OFFERING A THIRD OBAMA TERM BROUGHT TO YOU BY ANOTHER CLINTON.
[BOOS] AND YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO BE
EXCITED ABOUT THAT. FOR A COUNTRY SO READY FOR
CHANGE, IT FEELS LIKE WE HAVE
BEEN CLEARED FOR TAKEOFF AND
SOMEBODY ANNOUNCED WE ARE ALL
GOING BACK TO THE GATES. IT'S LIKE WE HAVE BEEN ON HOLD
FOREVER, WAITING TO FINALLY TALK
TO A REAL PERSON AND SOMEHOW WE
HAVE BEEN SENT BACK TO THE MAIN
MENU. WATCH THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY
CONVENTION NEXT WEEK. THAT FOUR DAY INFOMERCIAL OF
POLITICALLY CORRECT MORALIZING. IT'D IT BE A REMINDER OF ALL
THAT IS AT STAKE IN THIS
ELECTION.
YOU CAN GET THROUGH FOUR DAYS
WITH A LITTLE HELP FROM THE MUTE BUTTON. BUT FOR MORE YEARS OF IT? NOT A CHANCE. NOT A CHANCE.
[APPLAUSE] LOOK, THE OBAMA YEARS ARE ALMOST
OVER, THE CLINTON YEARS ARE WAY
OVER. 2016 IS THE YEAR AMERICA MOVES
ON.
[APPLAUSE] FROM NOW UNTIL NOVEMBER, WE WILL
HEAR HOW MANY DIFFERENT WAYS PROGRESSIVE ELITISTS CAN FIND TO
TALK DOWN TO THE REST OF AMERICA, TO TELL US THAT THE
OBAMA YEARS HAVE BEEN GOOD FOR
YOU.
AND NOW THAT IT IS HILLARY'S
TERM.
[BOOS] THE PROBLEM IS SIMPLE. THERE IS A REASON PEOPLE IN OUR
COUNTRY ARE DISAPPOINTED AND RESTLESS. IF OPPORTUNITY SEEMS LIKE IT HAS
BEEN SLIPPING AWAY, THAT IS
BECAUSE IT HAS. LIBERAL PROGRESSIVE IDEAS HAVE
DONE EXACTLY NOTHING TO HELP. WAGES NEVER SEEM TO GO UP. THE WHOLE ECONOMY FEELS STUCK,
AND MILLIONS OF AMERICANS --
MIDDLE-CLASS SECURITY IS NOT
JUST A MEMORY. OUR PRESIDENT LIKES TO TALK
FOREVER ABOUT PROPERTY AND IF
HIGH SOUNDING TALK DID ANY GOOD,
WE WOULD HAVE OVERCOME THOSE
DEEP PROBLEMS LONG AGO. THIS EXPLAINS WHY UNDER THE MOST
LIBERAL PRESIDENT WE HAVE HAD SO FAR, POVERTY IN AMERICA IS
WORSE, ESPECIALLY FOR OUR FELLOW CITIZENS WHO WERE PROMISED BETTER AND YOU NEEDED MOST. THE RESULT IS A RECORD OF DISCARDED PROMISES, EMPTY GESTURES, PHONY STRAWMAN ARGUMENT THAT ARE PUT OFF FOREVER. SHADY POWER PLAYS LIKE THE ONE
THAT GAVE US OBAMACARE. CONSTITUTIONAL LIMIT RUSHED OFF
AS NOTHING. ALL THE WHILE, DANGERS IN THE WORLD DOWNPLAYED.
EVEN EXPRESS GROW BOLDER AND
COME CLOSER. IT IS THE LAST CHAPTER OF AN OLD
STORY. PROGRESSIVES DELIVER EVERYTHING
EXCEPT PROGRESS.
[APPLAUSE] WE KNOW BETTER THAN TO THINK
THAT REPUBLICANS WHEN ONLY BEEN
ON THE FAILURES OF DEMOCRATS. IT STILL COMES DOWN TO A CONTEST
OF IDEAS, WHICH IS GOOD NEWS. WHEN IT IS ABOUT IDEAS, THE AVENGERS GOES TO US. AGAINST THE JURY BACKDROP OF POINTLESS MANDATES, RECKLESS
BORROWING, WILLFUL RETREAT FROM THE WORLD, AND ALL THAT
PROGRESSIVES HAVE IN STORE FOR
US, THE REPUBLICAN PARTY STANDS
AS THE GREAT ENDURING ALTERNATIVE PARTY. ERWE BELIEVE IN MAKING GOVERNMENT
AS RONALD REAGAN SAID. NOT THE DISTRIBUTOR OF GIFTS AND PRIVILEGE, BUT THE PROTECTOR OF
OUR LIBERTIES.
[APPLAUSE] LET THE OTHER PARTY GO ON MAKING
ITS CASE FOR MORE GOVERNMENT CONTROL OVER EVERY ASPECT OF OUR
LIVES. MO TEXASRE TO PAY, MORE DEBT TO
CARRY, MORE RULES, MORE JUDGES
THAT MAKE IT UP AS THE GO ALONG. WE IN THIS PARTY ARE COMMITTED
TO A FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAT ASK
AGAIN AS A SERVICE. ACCOUNTABLE TO THE PEOPLE,
FOLLOWING THE CONSTITUTION.
VENTURING NOT ONE INCH BEYOND
THE CONSENT OF THE GOVERNED.
[APPLAUSE] WE IN THIS PARTY OFFER
FUNDAMENTALS THAT GO BACK TO THE
FOUNDING GENERATION. WE BELIEVE IN A FREE SOCIETY,
WHERE ASPIRATION AND EFFORT CAN
MAKE THE DIFFERENCE IN EVERY
LIFE.
WHERE YOUR STARTING POINT IS NOT
YOUR DESTINY. AND WHERE YOUR FIRST CHANCE IS
NOT YOUR ONLY CHANCE. WE OFFER A BETTER WAY FOR
AMERICA WITH IDEAS THAT ACTUALLY
WORK.
A REFORMED TAX CODE THAT REWARDS
FREE ENTERPRISE INSTEAD OF JUST
ENTERPRISING LOBBYISTS. A REFORMED SYSTEM THAT OPERATES
BY FREE CHOICE INSTEAD OF BY FORCE AND DOESN'T LEAVE YOU
ANSWERING THE COLD CLUELESS
BUREAUCRATS. A COMMITMENT TO A RENEWED 21ST CENTURY MILITARY, GIVING OUR
VETERANS THE CARE THAT THEY
PROMISED AND WERE EARNED.
-- THEY WERE PROMISED AND
EARNED.
[APPLAUSE] AND WE OFFER A BETTER WAY FOR
DEALING WITH PERSISTENT POVERTY
IN THIS COUNTRY.
A WAY THAT SHOWS POOR AMERICANS
THE WORLD BEYOND LIBERAL WAREHOUSING AND CHECKWRITING INTO THE LIFE EVERYONE CAN FIND WITH OPPORTUNITY AND
INDEPENDENCE. THE HAPPINESS OF USING YOUR GIFTS AND THE DIGNITY OF HAVING A JOB. NONE OF THIS WILL HAPPEN UNDER HILLARY CLINTON. ONLY WITH DONALD TRUMP AND MIKE PENCE DO WE HAVE A CHANCE OF A
BETTER WAY.
[APPLAUSE] AND LAST POINT, LET THE OTHER
PARTY GO ON AND ON WITH ITS
CONSTANT DIVIDING UP OF PEOPLE. ALWAYS PLAYING ONE GROUP AGAINST
THE OTHER AS IF GROUP IDENTITY
WERE EVERYTHING. IN AMERICA, AREN'T WE ALL SUPPOSED TO BE BEYOND CLASS? BEYOND ETHNICITY? ARE ALL THESE OTHER LINES DRAWN US TO LOCK US INTO GROUPS? REAL SOCIAL PROGRESS IS ALWAYS A
WIDENING OF THE CIRCLE OF
CONCERN AND PROTECTION. IT IS RESPECT AND EMPATHY
OVERTAKING BLINDNESS AND
INDIFFERENCE. IT IS UNDERSTANDING THAT BY THE TRUE MEASURE WE ARE ALL
NEIGHBORS AND COUNTRYMEN, CALLED TO EACH ONE OF US TO KNOW WHAT IS RIGHT AND KIND AND JUST. EVERYONE IS EQUAL. EVERYONE HAS A PLACE. NO ONE IS WRITTEN OFF. THERE IS WORTH AND GOODNESS IN
EVERY LIFE. STRAIGHT FROM THE DECLARATION OF
INDEPENDENCE, THAT IS THE
REPUBLICAN IDEAL. IF WE WANT TO DEFEND IT, WHO
WILL?
-- WON'T DEFEND IT, WHO WILL? SO MUCH THAT YOU AND I CARE ABOUT, SO MANY THINGS THAT WE STAND FOR IN THE BALANCE OF THIS COMING ELECTION. WE SHOULD NOT LACK FOR
MOTIVATION. IN THE PLAINEST TERMS I KNOW, IT
IS ALL ON THE LINE. LET US ACT THAT WAY. LET'S USE THE EDGE THAT WE HAVE BECAUSE IT IS STILL WHAT TURNS
THE TRUST". THIS YEAR OF SURPRISES AND DRAMATIC TURN SKIN AND IN THE
FINEST POSSIBLE WAY WHEN AMERICA ELECTS A CONSERVATIVE GOVERNING MAJORITY. WE CAN DO THIS. YOU CAN EARN THAT MANDATE IF WE
DON'T HOLD ANYTHING BACK, IF WE NEVER LOSE SIGHT OF THE SPACE AND WHAT IS ON THE TABLE. OUR CANDIDATES WILL BE GIVING
THEIR ALL AND EVERY ONE OF US
HAS GOT TO GO IN TO -- AND DO
THE SAME. SO, WHAT DO YOU SAY?
WHAT DO YOU SAY THAT WE UNIFY THIS PARTY AT ITS CRUCIAL MOMENT WHEN UNITY IS EVERYTHING? LET'S TAKE OUR FIGHT TO OUR
OPPONENTS WITH BETTER IDEAS, LET'S STAY IN THE OFFENSIVE, LET'S COMPETE IN EVERY PART OF AMERICA AND TURN OUT AT THE
POLLS LIKE EVERY LAST VOTE MATTERS BECAUSE IT WILL. LET'S SEE THIS THING THROUGH.
LET'S WIN THIS THING AND SHOW
AMERICA OUR BEST AND NOTHING
LESS. THANK YOU AND GOD BLESS.
