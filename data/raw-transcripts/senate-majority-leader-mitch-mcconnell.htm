<strong>Mitch McConnell Jr.</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> SEN. MCCONNELL: LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I HAVE BEEN AROUND A
WHILE. MORE THAN ANYBODY SHOULD HAVE TO
BE. A COUPLE YEARS AGO BILL AND
HILLARY CLINTON OUT<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> OF MY STATE, TELLING ANYBODY WHO WOULD
LISTEN. TONIGHT I AM HERE TO RETURN THE FAVOR. I AM A PATIENT MAN, AND THE
YOUNG CHILD OF THE SOUTH. I WAS STRUCK WITH POLIO IN FORCED TO STAY OFF MY FEET FOR TWO YEARS. THAT EXPERIENCED TAUTLY AND
ABIDING GRATITUDE FOR MY PARENTS. AND IT ALSO TAUGHT ME HOW TO WAIT, WHICH COMES IN HANDY WHEN
YOU ARE THE LEADER OF THE U.S.
SENATE.
MORE THAN ANYTHING, MY JOB HAS
TAUGHT ME THE VALUE OF TRUST. HOW TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN
PEOPLE WHO ARE INTERESTED TO SERVE OTHERS, AND THOSE WHO ARE
IN IT FOR THEMSELVES. I AM HERE TO TELL YOU THAT
HILLARY CLINTON WILL SAY
ANYTHING, DO ANYTHING, AND BE ANYTHING TO GET ELECTED
PRESIDENT. AND WE CANNOT ALLOW IT. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE TIRED OF
HEARING ABOUT THE BOUNTY OF
GOVERNMENT WHILE THE COST OF
CARING FOR A FAMILY OR MEETING DAILY EXPENSES ROSE OUT OF
REACH. OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS, THEY HAVE SEEN GOVERNMENT ABUSE THEIR OFFICE AND GET REWARDED FOR IT. THEY HAVE SEEN THE MIDDLE CLASS
ACTUALLY SHRINK. AND IN THE MIDST OF THIS, THEY HAVE RAISED A VERY SIMPLE
COMPLAINT. WHO IS LOOKING OUT FOR US? IT'S NOT HILLARY. I HAVE HAD MY DIFFERENCES WITH BARACK OBAMA, BUT I WILL GIVE
HIM CREDIT FOR THIS. AT LEAST HE WAS UP FRONT ABOUT HIS PLANS TO MOVE AMERICA TO THE
FAR LEFT. NOT HILLARY. JULY THE ABOUT HER E-MAILS.
-- SHE LIED ABOUT HER E-MAILS, ABOUT HER SERVER, ABOUT
BENGHAZI. SHE EVEN LIED ABOUT SNIPER FIRE. WHY, EVEN SHE LIED ABOUT WHY HER
PARENTS NAMED HER HILLARY. SO I ASK YOU A SIMPLE QUESTION. AT A MOMENT WHEN SO MANY FEEL
BETRAYED BY THE GOVERNMENT, WHY
IN THE WORLD WOULD DEMOCRATS PUT
FORWARD SUCH A CANDIDATE? HILLARY HAS CHANGED POSITIONS OF
SO MANY TIMES IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO
TELL WHERE THE CONVICTION ENDS AND THE AMBITION BEGINS. IN 2010, SHE SAT AROUND RICH
URANIUM. IN 2014, SHE SAID SHE HAS
ALREADY ARGUED AGAINST IT.
ONCE A BACKER OF THE KEYSTONE PIPELINE, LAST YEAR SHE OPPOSED IT. SHE USED TO BE AGAINST SANCTUARY CITIES AND CLAIMS SHE WAS FOR THEM.
NOW WE ARE NOT SURE WHERE SHE
IS. FNOT SINCE BAGHDAD BOB HAS THERE
BEEN A FIGURE WITH BASE SUCH A
TORTURED FIGURE -- WITH SUCH A
TORTURED RELATIONSHIP WITH THE
TRUTH.
[APPLAUSE] FORTUNATELY THERE IS A CLEAR CHOICE BEFORE US, AND IT'S NOT HILLARY. YOU KNOW WHAT THE NEXT FOUR
YEARS WILL LOOK LIKE WITH
HILLARY. AND YOU KNOW THAT IF HILLARY IS PRESIDENT, WE WILL CONTINUE TO SLIDE, DISTRACTED BY THE SCANDAL THAT FOLLOWS THE CLINTONS LIKE FLIES.
TWO YEARS AGO, VOTERS DELIVERED A CLEAR VERDICT ON THE OBAMA
YEARS BY SETTING A FRESHMAN CLASS OF ROCKSTAR REPUBLICANS TO
THE SENATE. AND DELIVERING US A MAJORITY THAT I PROMISED TO MAKE YOU PROUD OF. WE HAVE NEVER HESITATED TO
CONFRONT THE PRESIDENT. WE ALSO DID THE HARD WORK OF
TACKLING URGENT PROBLEMS HEAD
ON. WE DELIVERED ON THAT PROMISE. WE PUT OBAMACARE REVEALED ON THE
PRESIDENT'S DESK. HE VETOED IT. DONALD TRUMP WOULD SIGN IT.
[APPLAUSE] WE PASSED A BILL TO BUILD THE
KEYSTONE PIPELINE. OBAMA VETOED IT. DONALD TRUMP WOULD SIGN IT. WE PASSED A BILL TO DEFINE THE PLANNED PARENTHOOD. OBAMA VETO IT. DONALD TRUMP WOULD SIGN IT. AND ON THAT SAD DAY WHEN WE LOST JUSTICE SCALIA, I MADE ANOTHER PLEDGE THAT OBAMA WOULD NOT FILL THAT SEAT. THAT HONOR WILL GO TO DONALD
TRUMP THIS YEAR.
[APPLAUSE] SO WITH DONALD TRUMP IN THE WHITE HOUSE, SENATE REPUBLICANS WILL BUILD ON THE WORK WE HAVE DONE AND PASSMORE BILLS THAN ANY SENATE IN YEARS. WE HAVE ALREADY PASSED THE FIRST
MAJOR EDUCATION REFORM IN MORE
THAN A DECADE AND ENDED COMMON
CORE. WE HAVE MADE THE FIRST
SIGNIFICANT REFORMS IN SOCIAL
SECURITY IN THREE DECADES. WE PASSED A CRUCIAL CYBER
SECURITY BILL AND OPPOSED
SANCTIONS ON NORTH KOREA. WE HAS TO FIRST MAJOR HIGHWAY
BILL IN MORE THAN A DECADE. PASTOR BILL TO COMBAT THE
SCOURGE OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING. JUST LAST WEEK WE PASSED THE
FIRST MAJOR LAW AIMED AT CONFRONTING THE HEARTBREAKING EXPLOSION OF HER WHEN AN OPIOID ABUSE.
-- OF HEROIN AND WILL BE WOULD ABUSE.
KEEP THE SENATE IN REPUBLICAN HANDS AND WE WILL CONTINUE THIS WORK AND THE SERVICE I AM PROUD TO LEAD IN THE SENATE WILL NOT LET YOU DOWN. PUT HILLARY CLINTON AND I
PROMISE YOU THIS, SHE WILL DOUBLE DOWN ON THE CYNICAL
APPROACH THAT SENATE DEMOCRATS SEEM TO REVEL IN THESE DAYS. HERE IS WHAT I MEAN.
AS WE SIT HERE TONIGHT, A
TERRIFYING MOSQUITO BORNE ILLNESS THREATENS EXPECTANT
MOTHERS AND THEIR BABIES ALONG OUR SOUTHERN COAST.
JUST LAST WEEK, CLINTON DEMOCRATS IN THE SENATE BLOCKED A BILL AIMED AT ERADICATING THAT
VIRUS BEFORE IT CAN SPREAD. AND THEY WEREN'T FINISHED. THEY STOPPED A FUNDING BILL THAT
WOULD SUPPORT THE BRAVE MEN AND
WOMEN RIGHT NOW DEFENDING US
OVERSEAS. WHA IN THE WORLDT TO THESE
PEOPLE THINK PUBLIC SERVICE IS
ABOUT? I DON'T KNOW. IF HILLARY CLINTON IS PRESIDENT,
NOTHING WILL CHANGE. I ASK YOU TO LET US CONTINUE OUR WORK. LET US PUT JUSTICES ON THE SUPREME COURT THAT CHERISH OUR
CONSTITUTION.
[APPLAUSE] LET US KEEP THE SENATE. AND LET US SELECT A PRESIDENT AND VICE PRESIDENT THAT REALLY BELIEVE AMERICA IS EXCEPTIONAL.
[APPLAUSE] THANK YOU MY FRIENDS, AND GOD
BLESS AMERICA.
