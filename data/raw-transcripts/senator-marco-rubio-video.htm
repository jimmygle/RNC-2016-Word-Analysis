<strong>Marco Rubio</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> HILLARY CLINTON SPENT HER LIFETIME INSIDE A CORRUPT
POLITICAL SYSTEM THAT PUT HER INTEREST ABOVE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. SHE PLANTED THE SEEDS FOR THE<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> DISASTER OF OBAMACARE, AND WAS
FOR CRONYISM, WALL STREET BAILOUTS, MIDDLE-CLASS TAX HIKES, AND UNCONTROLLABLE GOVERNMENT SPENDING. SHE WAS A KEY FIGURE IN PRESIDENT OBAMA'S HORRIBLE FOREIGN POLICY RECORD,
DIMINISHING OUR ROLE IN THE
WORLD.
SHE TURNED HER BACK ON THE FALLEN HEROES IN BENGHAZI,
CARELESSLY JEOPARDIZED OUR
NATIONAL SECURITY, AND LIGHT
ABOUT IT TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.
HILLARY CLINTON DOES NOT HAVE
THE HONESTY, COURAGE, OR INDEPENDENCE TO BE THE PRESIDENT WE NEED THE NEXT FOUR YEARS
AFTER THE PRESIDENT WE HAD FOR
THE PAST EIGHT. UNLIKE HILLARY CLINTON, DONALD TRUMP IS COMMITTED TO CUT TAXES AND GET OUR NATIONAL DEBT UNDER CONTROL. UNLIKE OBAMA AND CLINTON, TRUMP TAKES SERIOUSLY THE THREAT FROM
ISLAMIC RADICALS AND WAS TO
REBUILD OUR MILITARY. AND TRUMP WANTS TO COMMIT PROPER
JUDGES WHO RESPECT THE ROLE OF
THE JUDICIARY. THE TIME FOR FIGHTING EACH OTHER
IS OVER, IT IS TIME TO COME TOGETHER AND FIGHT FOR A NEW
DIRECTION FOR AMERICA. IT IS TIME TO WIN IN NOVEMBER.
