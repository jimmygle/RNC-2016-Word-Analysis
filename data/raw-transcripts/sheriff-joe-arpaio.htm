<strong>Steven R. Bailey</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> THANK YOU. THANK YOU, ARIZONA. CHAIRMAN ROBERT GRAHAM, THANK
YOU.
THANK YOU. THANK YOU.
[CHEERING] I HAVE SPENT 55 YEARS IN LAW ENFORCEMENT, 55 YEARS<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> AND HAVE ALWAYS REGARDED MY WORK, THE MISSION IS CRITICAL, BUT MY MOST
IMPORTANT MISSION HAS JUST BEGUN, TO HELP ELECT DONALD
TRUMP.
[CHEERING] PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.
[CHEERING] THE STAKES ARE HIGH. WE NEED A STRONG LEADER WHO WILL
STAND UP FOR AMERICA AND PUT THE
INTEREST OF HER CITIZENS FIRST. UNFORTUNATELY, WE ARE LOSING THE BATTLE.
WE'RE THE ONLY COUNTRY IN THE WORLD WHOSE IMMIGRATION SYSTEM
PUTS THE NEEDS OF OTHER NATIONS
AHEAD OF OURS. WE ARE MORE CONCERNED WITH THE
RIGHTS OF ILLEGAL ALIENS AND CRIMINALS FAMILY ARE WITH
REJECTING OUR OWN COUNTRY.
[CHEERING]
-- PROTECTING OUR OWN COUNTRY. THAT MUST CHANGE.
WE NEED A LEADER WHO WILL
PROTECT OUR BORDERS AND ENFORCE OUR LAWS BECAUSE A NATION WITHOUT BORDERS AND A NATION WITHOUT LAWS IS NO NATION AT ALL.
[CHEERING] AND NOW, MORE THAN EVER, WE MUST RESPECT THE POLICE.
[CHEERING] WE MUST GIVE THEM THE TOOLS AND
THE SUPPORT THEY NEED TO DO
THEIR JOBS. THE HIGHEST LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT
MUST HAVE OUR BACKS AS THEY RISK
THEIR LIVES EVERYTHING OK TO
PERFORM THEIR JOBS AND PROTECT OUR CITIZENS. AS SOMEONE WHO FOR 35 YEARS HAS BEEN A TOP ONE FOURTH THE
OFFICIAL LIVING AND WORKING ON BOTH SIDES OF THE BORDER, I CAN TELL YOU FIRSTHAND ABOUT THE
DANGERS OF ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION AND DRUGS.
WE HAVE TERRORISTS COMING OVER
OUR BORDERS. INFILTRATING OUR COMMUNITIES AND CAUSING MASSIVE DESTRUCTION AND
MAYHEM. WE HAVE CRIMINALS AND DETERGENT OR WEAK BORDER -- PENETRATING OUR WEAK BORDER SYSTEM AND COMMITTING CRIMES.
I'M SUPPORTING DONALD TRUMP
BECAUSE HE IS A LEADER.
[CHEERING] HE PRODUCES RESULTS.
HE IS THE ONLY CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT READY TO GET TOUGH IN
ORDER TO PROTECT AMERICANS.
[CHEERING] I HAVE THOUGHTS ON THE FRONT
LINES TO PREVENT ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION AND I KNOW DONALD TRUMP WILL STAND WITH ME AND
OTHER PROUD AMERICANS TO SECURE OUR BORDERS.
[CHEERING] DONALD TRUMP WILL BUILD A WALL.
[CHEERING] AND RESTORE LAW AND ORDER AND KEEP DRUGS AND ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS FROM ENTERING INTO
OUR COUNTRY.
[CHEERING] I WILL NEVER FORGET DONALD TRUMP
AND WHAT HE DID FOR MY WIFE. I'VE BEEN MARRIED TO EVA FOR 59 YEARS.
[CHEERING] AND DURING THE CAMPAIGN, SHE WAS
DIAGNOSED WITH CANCER. JUST BEFORE GOING ON NATIONAL TV, DONALD TRUMP CALLED MY WIFE
AND TALK TO HER FOR FIVE MINUTES. SUBSEQUENT TRIPS, HE NEVER
FORGOT TO THINK OF MY WIFE. AND CALL HER. HE DID NOT HAVE TO GET MY SUPPORT THROUGH HIS KINDNESS TO MY WIFE BECAUSE I WAS ALREADY HOOKED.
[CHEERING] LET'S ELECT A LEADER WHO WILL
STAND UP FOR AMERICA.
[CHEERING] AND PROTECT OUR BORDERS. SUPPORT LAW ENFORCEMENT.
[CHEERING] AND THE MILITARY!
[CHEERING] AND IN DOING SO, UNITE OUR COUNTRY.
[CHEERING] LET'S ELECT DONALD TRUMP!
[CHEERING] THANK YOU.
