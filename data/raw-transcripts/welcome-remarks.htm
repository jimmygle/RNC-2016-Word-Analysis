<p class='short_transcript'> >> WELCOME.
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, DELEGATES, CITIZENS, AND PATRIOTS. WELCOME TO THE 41ST REPUBLICAN
NATIONAL CONVENTION. WHEN LAST THE GRAND OLD PARTY,
OR<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> AS A NEW TWIT SAY, THE PARTY OF GROWTH AND PROGRESS GATHERED IN THE GREAT CITY IT WAS 80
YEARS AGO. IMAGINE IN 1936 OUR NATION WAS
STILL ON ITS BACK, REELING FROM
THE AFTERSHOCKS OF THE 1929
STOCK MARKET CRASH. THE DUST BOWL WAS STILL IN
GOLFING THE MIDWEST. AND THE AVERAGE ANNUAL FAMILY INCOME WAS JUST OVER $1500 PER
YEAR. FEELS A LOT LIKE THE LAST
SEVENTH AND FIVE YEARS OF BARACK
OBAMA TO ME.
-- LAST 7.5 YEARS OF BARACK OBAMA TO ME. JAMES CLEVELAND WINS, JESSE OWENS, A BLACK SON OF A SHARECROPPER IN ALABAMA WON FOUR GOLD MEDALS IN THE OLYMPIC
GAMES, THUMBING AMERICA'S NOSE
IN HITLER'S FACE. THE DUTIES INCUMBENT UPON US AS
DELEGATES AND CITIZENS AND PATRIOTS HAVE NEVER CHANGED IN
THE 80 YEARS. OUR JOBS HERE ARE THE SAME AS
THEY WERE 80 YEARS AGO, THE
RIGHT, THE LIBERTY, AND THE
PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS, ONLY GIVE IT TO US BY GOD. FOR THE NEXT FEW WE GATHER HERE
IN THE HOME OF THE WORLD CHAMPION CLEVELAND CAVALIERS. I WANT TO THANK DAN GILBERT, THE
FOUNDER OF CAN LOANS AND OWNER
OF THE 2016 NBA CHAMPION FOR BEING OUR PERSONAL HOST AND TRUE
FRIEND IN CLEVELAND. I ALSO WANT TO THANK MAYOR FRANK JAN -- FRANK JACKSON. AND THE ENTIRE GOP HOST
COMMITTEE LED BY CHRIS CONNOR, SANDY CUTLER, SETH, AND THEIR CEO DAVID GILBERTS, WHO HAVE
SPENT EVERY MORNING AND NIGHT
SINCE 2014 MAKING THIS HOUR REALITY, OUR TIME, AND OUR PLACE
OF CHOOSING IN CLEVELAND. THANK YOU. IN 1980, NOT FAR FROM HERE, IN
THE CITY OF DETROIT, ANOTHER GREAT RUST BELT IN METROPOLIS THAT NEVER GAVE UP, THE WORK OF DELEGATES RESULTED IN THE
NOMINATION OF A MAN WHO WAS GIVEN NO REAL CHANCE TO BECOME THE NEXT LEADER OF THE FREE WORLD. HIS NAME WAS RONALD REAGAN. AND HE LOOKED AT HIS JOB AS THE
40TH PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES MUCH THE SAME AS WE
DELEGATES HERE DO. IF YOU WANT TO MAKE AMERICA
GREAT YOU CAN ACCOMPLISH
ANYTHING IF YOU DON'T CARE WHO
GETS THE CREDIT. ONCE AGAIN AMERICA IS AT A
CROSSROADS. WE HAVE IN OUR HANDS THE STEERING WHEEL OF THE POLITICAL
PARTY IN THIS COUNTRY. BUMPY ROADS, BUT WE ARE NOT
GOING TO TURN LEFT. AS DELEGATES WE UNDERTAKE THE DUTIES AND BLESSINGS FOR MAKING
FREEDOM WORK FOR THE NEXT
GENERATION. A NATIONAL CONVENTION IS MORE
THAN JUST A NATIONAL BROADCAST, A SERIES OF SOUND BITES
SNIPPETS, OR TWEETS. IT IS THE CAREFUL WORK OF A
NATION UNITING AND PURPOSE. WE ARE THE SOUND OF AN AMERICAN HEART BEAT POUNDING FOR CHANGE. WHETHER YOU ARE HERE IN
CLEVELAND OR WATCHING FROM HOME,
STAY TUNED FOR A POWERFUL WEEK. MAKE THIS CONVENTION YOUR CONVENTION, NOW LETS MIX OF NOISE.
GOD BLESS AMERICA.</span><span class='hidden-full-transcript-ellipses'>...</span></p><a href='#' class='hidden-full-transcript-link'><i class='icon-chevron-down'></i> <span class='link-show-full-text'>Show Full Text</span><i class='icon-chevron-up'></i> <span class='link-show-less-text'>Show Less Text</span></a>
