<strong>Matt Walter</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> GOOD AFTERNOON.
I MET WALTER, PRESIDENT OF THE
REPUBLICAN STATE LEADERSHIP COMMITTEE, REPRESENTING
AMERICA'S LARGEST CAUCUS OF
REPUBLICAN LEADERS.
AS<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> WE, WE ARE RENEWING OUR
COMMITMENT TO THE DEMOCRATIC
PROCESS THAT MAKES AMERICA
GREAT. BY CELEBRATING THE NOMINATION OF NEW YORKER DONALD TRUMP AND INDIANA'S MIKE PENCE. WITH MUCH TO CELEBRATE AT THE TOP OF THE TICKET, ONE OF THE
MOST AMAZING STORIES IS AT THE
STATE LEVEL, WHERE REAL ACTION
AND REAL RESULTS ARE HAPPENING. GOVERNMENT CLOSEST TO THE PEOPLE
HAS ALWAYS GOVERNED BEST,
ESPECIALLY IN TODAY'S BOTTOM-UP WORLD. REPUBLICAN STATE LEADERS
RECOGNIZE THIS AND IMPLEMENT
POLICIES THAT MAKE A REAL
DIFFERENCE TO PEOPLE'S POCKETBOOK, ROADS AND BRIDGES WHILE CREATING OPPORTUNITIES FOR
THE FUTURE. IT IS A STARK CONTRAST TO THE INSIDER, D.C. MINDSET THAT HAS ACCOMPLISHED VIRTUALLY NOTHING OTHER THAN REPEATEDLY AND UNDER CONSTANT OVERREACHING INTO THE
STATE. VOTERS HAVE EXPERIENCED THIS
FIRST HAND AND SAID ENOUGH IS
ENOUGH. THEY KICKED STATE DEMOCRATS OUT
IN DROVES AND GIVING REPUBLICANS AND ALMOST UNHEARD OF 900 NEW LEGISLATIVE SEATS IN THE OBAMA
ERA WHILE JUST LAST WEEK, GALLUP
POLLING SHOWED VOTERS PREFER THEIR STATE GOVERNMENT TO THE EC
GOVERNMENT BY NEARLY TWO TO ONE. REPUBLICANS HOLD AN ALL-TIME RECORD OF 69 OF 99 LEGISLATURES AND HAVE MODERN RECORDS AND MANY
OTHER STATEWIDE OFFICES. SINCE 2002, THE LEADERSHIP COMMITTEE HAS SUPPORTED STATE LEVEL REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES FOR
LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR, ATTORNEY
GENERAL, SECRETARY OF STATE, LEGISLATORS, THE JUDICIARY, AND
MANY MORE. WITH THE WORLD'S ONLY TOP-LEVEL
DOMAIN RUN BY A POLITICAL PARTY,
WE HOUSE A CONCENTRATED EFFORT
ON BALLOT INITIATIVES WHILE OUR
RED MAP REDISTRICT AND PROGRAM
FIGHTS FOR DISTRICT LINES. PERHAPS MOST IMPORTANTLY, WE HAVE SPENT MILLIONS IDENTIFYING AND SUPPORTING THOUSANDS OF NEW
CANDIDATES OF DIVERSE ETHNICITY,
CREATING NEW LEADERS NOW AND STRENGTHENING OUR PARTIES BENT
FOR THE FUTURE. THE IMPORTANCE OF THE TEAM CANNOT BE OVERSTATED. A REPRESENT NEARLY HALF OF OUR
NATION'S PRESIDENTS AND A
MAJORITY OF THE CURRENT CONGRESS.
WE HAVE SEEN HISTORIC SUCCESS AT
THE STATE LEVEL RESUMING AND WITH SO MANY NEW CANDIDATES ON THE BALLOT AND YOUR HELP, THERE
IS MUCH MORE TO COME. THANK YOU, AND WE WILL SEE YOU AGAIN ON ELECTION DAY.
[APPLAUSE]
>> PLEASE WELCOME THE HONORABLE
FORMER GOVERNOR OF HAWAII.</span><span class='hidden-full-transcript-ellipses'>...</span></p><a href='#' class='hidden-full-transcript-link'><i class='icon-chevron-down'></i> <span class='link-show-full-text'>Show Full Text</span><i class='icon-chevron-up'></i> <span class='link-show-less-text'>Show Less Text</span></a>
