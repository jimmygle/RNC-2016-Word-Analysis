<p class='short_transcript'> >> HELLO, CLEVELAND!
[CHEERING]
>> BACK IN 2000 AND SIX -- 2006,
MY WIFE ANITA AND I, WE HAD THIS
EXTRAORDINARY EXPERIENCE, THIS
GREAT PLEASURE OF TOURING<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> AND
NAVAL BASE IN SAN DIEGO.
-- A  NAVAL BASE IN SAN DIEGO. OUR GUIDE THAT DAY JUST HAPPENED TO BE THIS BIG OLD TOPIC OF WATER NAVY SEAL WHO WAS
RECOVERING FROM COMBAT RELATED
INJURIES. NOW, HE IS A TEXAS BOY.
[CHEERING] HE WAS PRETTY PLAINSPOKEN AND RESPECTFUL AND HIS LOVE FOR AMERICA CAME THROUGH LOUD AND CLEAR. AS WE DEPARTED THAT DAY, I TOLD HIM, IF YOU'RE EVER IN AUSTIN,
AND BY NCS.
-- SEE US. SOME PEOPLE MIGHT SAY THAT
MEETING WAS JUST BLIND CHANCE. OR A TWIST OF FATE. I WILL TELL YOU, IT WAS BY THE
GRACE OF GOD.
[CHEERING] HE AND I KEPT IN TOUCH. OVER THE COURSE OF THE MONTHS
THROUGH A TOUR HE HAD IN IRAQ
AND HIS RETURN TO TEXAS. DARNED IF YOU DID NOT SHOW UP ON
THE DOORSTEP OF THE GOVERNOR'S
MANSION UNANNOUNCED. WITH NOWHERE ELSE TO GO. WE WELCOMED HIM INTO OUR HOME. WE HELPED HIM GET THE CARE THAT
HE NEEDED. AND TODAY, HE'S LIKE A SECOND
SON. MANY OF YOU KNOW THE
BATTLES HE FOUGHT IN
AFGHANISTAN, BUT TOO FEW OF YOU
KNOW THE BATTLES HE AND
THOUSANDS OF VETERANS JUST LIKE HIM FACE WHEN THEY COME HOME.
[CHEERING] TONIGHT, OUR COMMITMENT IS THIS,
MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN
STARTS BY TAKING CARE OF OUR
VETERANS.
[CHEERING] THANK YOU.
[CHEERING] LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, PLEASE WELCOME AN AMERICAN HERO, THE LONE SURVIVOR, MARCUS LATRELL.
[CHEERING]
-- LUTRELL.

<strong>Marcus Luttrell</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> CLEVELAND!
>>[CHEERING]
>>YOU ALL KNOW I LOVE YOU. I LOVE COMING DOWN HERE.
THANK YOU. THANK YOU.
[CHEERING] THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT.
>> USA! USA! USA!
>><span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> ALL RIGHT.
THANK YOU. THANK YOU AGAIN FOR HAVING ME
BACK. FOR THOSE OF YOU, I'VE SAID BEFORE IN THE PAST, IT IS A
PLEASURE TO DO SO AGAIN.
FOR THOSE OF YOU I'VE NOT SIT IN
FRONT OF, THANK YOU FOR THE
PRIVILEGE TO DO THAT. I MEAN IT FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART.
[CHEERING] I WAS FORTUNATE ENOUGH IN LIFE TO BE BORN FROM A PATRIOTIC FAMILY. TOMMY TO LOVE THIS COUNTRY AND
THE PEOPLE WHO MAKE HER UP.
UNCONDITIONALLY. TO DIE FOR ANY WOMAN IN FIGHT
BESIDE ANY MAN.
WITHOUT HESITATION. OR HOPE OF INDIVIDUAL ACHIEVEMENT.
THAT'S HOW I WAS RAISED IN THAT IS THE WAY I STILL WANT MY LIFE. GENERATIONS THE MEN AND WOMEN IN MY FAMILY HAVE SERVED THIS COUNTRY PROBABLY AT HOME AND ABROAD.
MY FATHER SERVED IN VIETNAM. ALTHOUGH HE WAS SHAMED OUT OF HIS UNIFORM, IT ONLY SOLIDIFIED HIS RESOLVE TO RAISE HIS VOICE
TO LOVE THIS COUNTRY AND BE PATRIOTIC AND LOVE THE PEOPLE
MORE THAN WE LOVE OURSELVES.
[CHEERING] IN FACT, 10 YEARS OF MY NAVY SEAL CAREER, MY FIRST AND WAS IN COMBAT AND THE NEXT PART I WAS
COMING AROUND THE COUNTRY, STATE
TO STATE, CITY TO CITY, TOWN TO
TOWN. ARMED ONLY WITH THE MEMBERS OF
YOUR BRAVEST FIGHTERS IN THE
STORY OF HOW HARD THEY FOUGHT. BECAUSE I WAS WILLING TO
COMPLETELY OPEN UP MY LIFE AND
ITS SPEAK ABOUT THE WORST WEEK OF IT, I WAS GLAD TO MEET AND
SEE ALL THE GREATEST PEOPLE
AMERICA HAD TO OFFER. I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT TO SAY THAT WE GOT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE HELL VETERANS RETURNED FROM
IS NOT THE HELL VETERANS RETURNED TO.
[CHEERING] THAT'S WHAT IS PROMISED AND THAT
IS WHAT IS DESERVED.
[CHEERING] IT ALSO AIMS ABOUT MY GENERATION
AND HOW I LOVE MY GENERATION.
GENERATION X. AN HONOR TO FIGHT ALONG ALL OF
YOU. EVEN WHEN THE SYSTEM DOES NOT
TAKE CARE OF OUR BOYS, CITIZENS
DEPOMED START FOUNDATION TO HELP
THE WOUNDED AND THE FAMILIES OF
THE FALLEN. FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART, AND
LITERALLY PLEASE NOTE THAT I AND EVERY DAY ON MY KNEES THANKING GOD FOR YOU. MY GENERATION ABETTORS IS COMING
HOME.
-- OF VETERANS IS COMING HOME.
[CHEERING] I GOT A CHANCE, FOR THOSE OF YOU
WHO KNOW ME, I ONLY TALK ABOUT
STUFF THAT I'VE EXPERIENCED AND
USUALLY ON THE WORST SIDE OF IT
AND THE SIDE OF IT.
I HAD A CHANCE TO SPEND TIME
WITH MR. TRUMP AND I KNOW HE UNDERSTANDS WHAT IS GOING TO
TAKE TO FIX THIS. THE ONLY WAY WE WILL KEEP AMERICA SAFE IS HAVING AN ELITE
MILITARY, ALL RIGHT.
[CHEERING] MADE UP OF THE WARRIORS AND
PREPARED BY THE TOUGHEST
TRAINING WE HAVE TO OFFER.
SUPPORTED BY THE BEST EQUIPMENT
AND BACKED UP BY THE NATION WHO
PUTS THOSE PEOPLE IN HARM'S WAY. EVERYONE OF US HAS TO STEP UP IN SOME WAY.
WE NEED OUR LEADERS TO LEAD BY EXAMPLE. THEY NEED TO LEAD BY EXAMPLE AND
SHOW THE AMERICAN PEOPLE -- PUBLIC THAT EACH AND EVERY LIFE
ON ANY DEVICE TO BE FAMILY AND
TREATED ACCORDINGLY.
[CHEERING] I'M SORRY, I'M SO USED AS "THE HEART WHEN I HAVE TO RESIST THE
GOES WRONG. I WAS GOING TO GO.
ARE YOU READY?
[CHEERING] NOT ONLY DO LEADERS HAVE TO STEP
UP AND SUPPORT US, BUT THE
FAMILY AND THOSE OF US AND HAS,
WE ARE ALL FAMILY.
NOT ONLY THAT, WE HOLD THEM
ACCOUNTABLE FOR EVERY POSITION IN OFFICE BEHOLD.
-- THEY HOLD.
[CHEERING] EITHER WAY, LOOK, IT AWAY, THE
ONLY WAY WE SURVIVED THIS IS
TOGETHER, NOT A PART. IN ORDER FOR ANY LIKE TO MATTER, WE ALL HAVE TO MATTER.
YOU UNDERSTAND?
[CHEERING] MY GENERATION, THE NEXT GENERATION, THIS IS FOR YOU. YOUR WAR IS HERE. YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO SEARCHING
FOR IT. YOUR PEOPLE ARE AFRAID. I STAND AMONG YOU WALKING, I WAS
ALLOWED TO WALK WITH GIANTS.
NOW WE ARE LOOKING FOR THE NEXT GENERATION OF DIES.
WHO AMONG YOU WILL LOVE
SOMETHING MORE THAN YOU LOVE IT
SO.
WHO AMONG YOU WILL STEP UP AND
TAKE THE FIGHT TO THE ENEMY?
[CHEERING] I CHALLENGE ALL OF YOU TO FIGHT FOR THIS COUNTRY AND FOR EACH
AND EVERY ONE OF US. THE WORLD OUTSIDE OF OUR BORDERS IS A DARK PLACE.
A SCARY PLACE. AMERICA IS THE LIGHT. AND HER PEOPLE ARE THE GOODNESS THAT GROWS FROM THAT. HE WILL ALWAYS BE WORTH FIGHTING FOR IT WAS MY GREATEST HONOR TO FIGHT FOR HER EVERY DAY OF MY ADULT LIFE.
[CHEERING] I JUST WANTED TO COME UP. AND THANK EACH AND EVERY ONE OF YOU FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART FOR ALLOWING ME TO SERVE YOU FOR 20 YEARS AND I SWEAR TO GOD I'M GOING TO SPEND THE NEXT 20
PAYING YOU BACK. THANK YOU AGAIN.
[CHEERING] GOD BLESS!
