<strong>Michael McCaul</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> GOOD EVENING. I MICHAEL MCCAUL, CHAIRMAN OF
THE HOMELAND SECURITY TO MIDI. AND I'M A FOURTH-GENERATION
TEXAN.
[CHEERING] BORN AND RAISED IN DALLAS<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> TEXAS. LET US REMEMBER THE DALLAS IN LOUISIANA POLICE OFFICERS WHO
TRAGICALLY LOST THEIR LIVES. AMERICA STANDS WITH MY HOMETOWN
AND WE WILL NEVER FORGET.
TO LAW-ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS
ACROSS THIS NATION, WE ARE WITH YOU AND WE WILL ALWAYS SUPPORT YOU.
[CHEERING]
[CHEERING] TONIGHT, WE HEARD POWERFUL TESTIMONY FROM PEOPLE WHO HAVE
BEEN DEVASTATED BY OBAMAS RECKLESS IMMIGRATION POLICY.
HAVEN'T WE HAD ENOUGH? HILLARY CLINTON IS PROMISING MORE OF THE SAME. OPEN BORDERS, EXECUTIVE AMNESTY, AND A SURGE OF SYRIAN REFUGEES.
>> BOO!
>> THIS IS A DANGEROUS LIBERAL AGENDA AND IT IS TIME FOR A
CHANGE. TIME TO TAKE BACK OUR COUNTRY
AND MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN.
[CHEERING]
>> USA. USA. USA.
>> USA. YOU AS A.
-- USA. WE NEED TO ADD SANCTUARY CITIES.
-- AND THANKS WERE CITIES.
-- END SANCTUARY CITIES,
.
[CHEERING] KEEP DANGEROUS PEOPLE OUT OF OUR
COUNTRY.
[CHEERING] AND SECURE OUR BORDERS ONCE AND
FOR ALL.
[CHEERING] OUR COUNTRY'S NASA GOES SECURITY
-- NATIONAL SECURITY IS AT RISK. PRESIDENT REAGAN ONCE REMINDED THAT AMERICA IS A SHINING CITY UPON A HILL.
A BEACON OF HOPE TO THE WORLD. AFTER EIGHT YEARS OF LEADERSHIP,
OUR CITY ON A HILL IS NOW A CITY
UNDER SIEGE. TODAY, OUR ALLIES NO LONGER
TRUST US. OUR ADVERSARIES NO LONGER FEAR
US. AND OUR ENEMIES ARE PLOTTING
AGAINST US. THIS DID NOT HAPPEN BY ACCIDENT. IT HAPPENED BY DESIGN. IT IS THE WORK OF A BARACK OBAMA
AND THE ARCHITECT OF HIS FAILED
FOREIGN POLICY HILLARY CLINTON.
[CHEERING] FOR YEARS, THEY PRESIDED OVER AMERICA'S RETREAT. AND THE CONSEQUENCES CLEAR. LEADING FROM BEHIND HAS LED US
INTO DANGER. WHEN HILLARY STOP TALKING ABOUT
THE WAR ON TERROR, OUR ENEMIES NOTICED. WHEN SHE HELPED WITHDRAW OUR FORCES FROM IRAQ, GREETING A POWER VACUUM, SHE PAVED THE WAY
FOR ISIS TO REAR ITS UGLY HEAD
AND OUR ENEMIES NOTICED. WHEN FOUR AMERICANS WERE
MURDERED AT BENGHAZI, IT BURNED.
SHE BLAMED IT ON A VIDEO. IN OUR ENEMIES NOTICED. WHEN SHE STOOD ON THE SIDELINES WHILE TERROR HOTSPOTS CORRUPTED
ACROSS THE GLOBE, OUR ENEMIES
NOTICED.
WE HAVE ALREADY SENT -- WITNESS THE RECENT ATTACKS IN PARIS,
BRUSSELS, A STABLE AND NOW WE
ARE IN THE CROSSHAIRS.
OUR OWN CITY STREETS HAVE BECOME
THE BATTLEGROUND. FT. HOOD, BOSTON, CHATTANOOGA, SAN BERNARDINO, ORLANDO. INSTEAD OF PROTECTING AMERICANS, THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION TURNED A BLIND EYE TO THE DANGERS. LET'S CUT TO THE SUFFOCATING POLITICAL CORRECTNESS.
[CHEERING] AND CALL THE THREAT WHAT IT REALLY IS, THE ENEMY IS RADICAL ISLAM.
[CHEERING] THESE FANATICS OF RADICALIZED -- HAVE RADICALIZED A RELIGION INTO A WEAPON TARGETING OUR WAY OF
LIFE. RESIDENT REAGAN ONCE ASKED IF
YOU ARE BETTER OFF THAN YOU WERE FOUR YEARS AGO? TONIGHT, LET ME ASK YOU THIS
QUESTION. ARE YOU SAFER THAN YOU WERE EIGHT YEARS AGO?
>> NO!
>> NO. IS OUR MILITARY STRONGER?
>> NO.
>> IS AMERICA STILL RESPECTED?
>> NO.
>> OVER AND OVER OF OBAMA AND HILLARY HAVE APOLOGIZED FOR
AMERICA AND ALLOWED JIHADISTS TO SPREAD LIKE WILDFIRE. WE CANNOT AFFORD HILLARY IN THE
WHITE HOUSE AGAIN.
[CHEERING] WE NEED SOMEONE WHO CAN REPAIR
THE DAMAGE SHE HAS DONE, TAKE
THE FIGHT TO THE ENEMY AND PUT AMERICA FIRST. BATMAN IS DONALD TRUMP.
-- THAT MAN IS DONALD TRUMP.
[CHEERING] I AM PROUD TO SERVE AS A MEMBER
OF HIS NATIONAL SECURITY TEAM. AND I CAN TELL YOU THIS, I CAN
TELL YOU THIS, DONALD WILL NEVER APOLOGIZE FOR AMERICAN
GREATNESS. HE WILL PROMOTE IT.
[CHEERING] IT IS TIME TO UNIFY AS A PARTY. IT IS TIME TO UNIFY AS A PARTY. HE WILL NEVER BOW DOWN TO OUR
ENEMIES. HE WILL STAND UP TO THEM. AND DONALD WILL NEVER ALLOW TERRORISTS TO GAIN GROUND AGAINST AMERICA. HE WILL SHAPE THE GROUND THEY
WALK ON.
[CHEERING] MY FATHER WAS A VOLUNTEER IN
WORLD WAR II AND PARTICIPATED IN
THE D-DAY EVENT IN AGAINST MONOPOLIES.
-- THE NAZIS. HIS GENERATION OFTEN CALLED THE
GREATEST. HEADING DOWN A SAFER AMERICA TO
GENERATION. NOW, WE ARE IN A STRUGGLE
AGAINST THE FORCES OF RADICAL
ISLAM AND TERROR WHICH MUST BE DEFEATED FOR OUR CHILDREN AND
OUR GRANDCHILDREN.
[CHEERING] PICKUP ADMINISTRATION WILL TAKE
ON THE FIGHT -- A DONALD TRUMP ADMINISTRATION WILL TAKE ON THIS POINT AND SEND A CLEAR MESSAGE TO ISLAMIC TERRORISTS. YOU MAY HAVE FIRED THE FIRST
SHOT, BUT REST ASSURED, AMERICA WILL FIRE THE LAST.
