<strong>Rudolph "Rudy" W. Giuliani</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU, NEW YORK.
[APPLAUSE] FOR A NEW YORKER<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> FOR ONCE ON THE
TICKET, DONALD TRUMP.
[CHEERING] I'M HERE TO SPEAK TO YOU ABOUT A VERY SERIOUS SUBJECT. HOW TO MAKE AMERICA SAFE. THE VAST MAJORITY OF AMERICANS TODAY DO NOT FEEL SAFE. THEY FEAR FOR THEIR CHILDREN. THEY CARE FOR THEMSELVES.
-- DO FOR THEMSELVES.
THEY FEAR FOR OUR POLICE
OFFICERS WERE BEING TARGETED
WITH A TARGET ON THEIR BACK. WE PRAY FOR OUR POLICE OFFICERS
IN DALLAS AND BATON ROUGE AND
THEIR FAMILIES.
[APPLAUSE] AND WE SAY THANK YOU TO THE
CLEVELAND POLICE DEPARTMENT FOR
PROTECTING US.
[CHEERING] THANK YOU. WE KNOW CALL, WE KNOW THE RISK
YOU ARE TAKING AND WE SAY THANK
YOU TO EVERY POLICE OFFICER AND
LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENT WHO IS OUT
TONIGHT PROTECTING US, BLACK, WHITE, LATINO, OF EVERY RACE, EVERY COLOR, EVERY CREED, EVERY SEXUAL ORIENTATION.
[CHEERING] WHEN THEY COME TO SAVE YOUR
LIFE, THEY DON'T ASK IF YOU ARE
BLACK OR WHITE, THEY JUST COME
TO SAVE YOU.
[CHEERING] WE ALSO REACH OUT, WE REACH OUT
OUR ARMS WITH UNDERSTANDING AND
COMPASSION. TO THOSE WHO HAVE LOST LOVED ONES BECAUSE OF POLICE SHOOTINGS
, SOME JUSTIFIED, SOME UNJUSTIFIED. THOSE THAT ARE UNJUSTIFIED, MUST
BE PUNISHED. THOSE THAT ARE JUSTIFIED, WE
MUST APOLOGIZE TO. IT IS TIME TO MAKE AMERICA SAFE
AGAIN.
IT IS TIME TO MAKE AMERICA ONE AGAIN.
ONE AMERICA.
[CHEERING] WHAT HAPPENED TO THERE'S NO
BLACK AMERICA, NO WHITE AMERICA, THERE IS JUST AMERICA?
[CHEERING] WHAT HAPPENED TO IT? WHERE DID IT GO? HOW HAS IT BLOWN AWAY?
[CHEERING] I KNOW WE CAN CHANGE IT BECAUSE
I DID IT BY CHANGING NEW YORK CITY FROM THE CRIME CAPITAL OF AMERICA TO THE SAFEST LARGE CITY
IN THE UNITED STATES.
[CHEERING] WHAT I DID FOR NEW YORK, DONALD
TRUMP WILL DO FOR AMERICA!
[CHEERING] I HAVE KNOWN DONALD TRUMP FOR
ALMOST 30 YEARS. AND HE HAS CREATED AN ACCOMPLISHED GREAT THINGS.
IN MY CITY, AND ALL OVER THE
WORLD. BEYOND THE THAT -- BEYOND THAT, THIS IS A MAN WITH A BIG HEART. EVERY TIME NEW YORK SUFFERED A
TRAGEDY, DONALD TRUMP WAS THERE TO HELP.
[CHEERING] HE'S NOT GOING TO LIKE MY TELLING YOU THIS, BUT HE DID IT
ANONYMOUSLY. WHEN POLICE OFFICERS WERE SHOT, FIRE FIGHTERS HURT, WHEN PEOPLE
WERE IN TROUBLE, HE CAME FORWARD
AND HELPED AND HE ASKED NOT TO BE MENTIONED. WELL, I'M GOING TO BREAK MY
PROMISE TO HIM, I'M GOING TO
MENTION IT. THIS IS A MAN WITH A BIG HEART
WHO LOVES PEOPLE, ALL PEOPLE FROM THE TOP TO THE BOTTOM, FROM
THE MIDDLE TO THE SIDE.
[CHEERING] I'M TELLING YOU THIS BECAUSE I'M
SICK AND TIRED OF THE DEFAMATION OF DONALD TRUMP BY THE MEDIA AND
BY THE CLINTON CAMPAIGN.
[CHEERING] I'M SICK AND TIRED OF IT! THIS IS A GOOD MAN.
[CHEERING] IN AMERICA SHOULD BE SICK AND TIRED OF THEIR VICIOUS, NASTY CAMPAIGN.
[CHEERING] YOU DESERVE TO KNOW THIS ABOUT YOUR NEXT PRESIDENT, HE'S BEEN A GREAT FATHER, FATHER-IN-LAW, GRANDFATHER, AND FRIEND TO ME, MY WIFE, AND MY FAMILY FROM MOST
30 YEARS. I KNOW HIM PERSONALLY. THIS IS A VERY GOOD AND DECENT MAN AND HE WILL BE A GREAT PRESIDENT.
[CHEERING] IN THE LAST SEVEN MONTHS, THERE HAVE BEEN FIVE MAJOR ISLAMIC TERRORIST ATTACKS ON US AND OUR ALLIES. WE MUST NOT BE AFRAID TO DEFINE
OUR ENEMY. IT IS ISLAMIC EXTREMIST TERRORISM.
[CHEERING] FOR THE PURPOSE OF THE MEDIA, I
DID NOT SAY ALL OF ISLAM. I DID NOT SAY MOST OF ISLAM. I SAID ISLAMIC EXTREMIST TERRORISM. YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE.
[CHEERING] AND WE ARE COMING TO GET YOU.
[CHEERING] FAILING TO IDENTIFY THEM, GOING
TO IDENTIFY THEM PROPERLY
MALIGNS ALL THOSE GOOD MUSLIMS
AROUND THE WORLD. FOR BEING KILLED BY THEM. THEY ARE KILLING MORE MUSLIMS
THAN ANYONE ELSE. IT ALSO SETS UP A FEAR OF BEING
POLITICALLY INCORRECT. I CAN HAVE SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES.
IT DID IN SAN BERNARDINO, IT DID WITH THE PERSON YOUNG OUTLAW BAR
-- ALAHU AKBAR.
THE ONLY PERSON WHO CANNOT DO THIS OUT THAT THIS WAS A
TERRORIST ATTACK WAS BARACK
OBAMA.
WHO CALLED IT WORKPLACE
VIOLENCE. THIS IS WHY OUR ENEMIES CSS
WEEKEND ON A. THEY HAVE SAID THE FIRST STEP IN DEFEATING OUR ENEMIES IS TO
IDENTIFY THEM PROPERLY AND SEE
THE CONNECTION BETWEEN THEM SO WE CAN FIND THEM AND CAPS ON. TO DEFEAT ISLAM INTO ITERIS, WE
MUST PUT THEM ON DEFENSE. IF THEY ARE AT WAR AGAINST US,
WHICH THEY HAVE DECLARED, WE MUST COMMIT OURSELVES TO UNCONDITIONAL VICTORY AGAINST
THEM.
[CHEERING] THIS INCLUDES ON DO IT -- UNDOING OF'S NUCLEAR AGREEMENT WITH IRAN THAT WILL EVENTUALLY, THAT WILL EVENTUALLY LET THEM
BECOME A NUCLEAR POWER AND IS
PUTTING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS BACK
INTO A COUNTRY THAT AT THE
WORLD'S LARGEST SUPPORTER OF
TERRORISM. WE ARE GIVING THEM THE MONEY TO FUND THE TERRORISTS WHO ARE
KILLING US AND OUR ALLIES. WE ARE GIVING THEM THE MONEY,
ARE WE CRAZY. DONALD TRUMP WILL MAKE SURE ANY AGREEMENT WITH IRAN MEETS THE
ORIGINAL GOALS OF THE U.S. AND
OUR ALLIES. AND ON NUCLEAR IRAN -- A NON-
NUCLEAR IRAN.
[CHEERING] DONALD TRUMP IS A LEADER. HE WILL REASSERT AMERICA'S POSITION AS THE NATION WITH THE BEST VALUES TO LEAD THE WORLD. IT WAS HILLARY CLINTON WHO ADVOCATED FOR THE OVERTHROW OF GOOD OFFICE IN LIBYA.
-- MUAMMAR GADDAFI LIBYA. LIBYA IS IN CHAOS.
HILLARY CLINTON IS ACCOUNTABLE
FOR THIS AND MUCH MORE. HER DERELICTION OF DUTY AND
FAILURE TO KEEPER PEOPLE SAFE
PLAYED A MAJOR ROLE AS YOU HEARD
TONIGHT AND THE HORRIFIC ISLAMIC TERRORIST MURDERS ON SEPTEMBER 11 AND 12, 2012. IN BENGHAZI.
WHICH CLAIMED THE LIVES OF FOUR
BRAVE AMERICANS. AMBASSADOR J CHRISTOPHER STEVENS, U.S. FOREIGN SERVICE OR
OFFICER JOHN SMITH AND CIA AGENTS TO RUN ASHWOOD AND BRANT DAUGHERTY. MAY THEY REST IN PEACE.
[APPLAUSE] AND CLINTON AND THE OBAMA
ADMINISTRATION FOR POLITICAL REASONS LIE. LIE ABOUT THE PURPOSE OF THE
ATTACK. INCLUDING HILLARY CLINTON LINE
DIRECTLY TO THE FAMILIES OF THE PEOPLE WHO WERE KILLED RIGHT TO
THEIR FACE.
>> BOO!
>> HILLARY CLINTON'S ANSWER TO
CONGRESS ABOUT THE DEATHS OF THESE BRAVE AMERICANS BECAUSE OF
HER GROSS FAILURE, SHE WAS QUOTE, WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT
MAKE?
>> BOO!
>> WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE? WATCH THE VIDEO YOURSELF. AND SEE THE ARROGANT DISREGARD FOR AMERICAN LIVES LOST
UNNECESSARILY BECAUSE OF HER AND THEN MAKE UP YOUR MIND. IT MEANS WE'RE GETTING TO THEM. IT MEANS WE'RE GETTING TO THEM. ANYONE WHO CAN SAY THAT IT MAKES A DIFFERENCE HOW OR WHY SERVING
AMERICA ARE KILLED SHOULD NOT BE
WITH THE AWESOME RESPONSIBILITY TO PROTECT US AND SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO BE OUR COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF.
[CHEERING] WHO WOULD TRUST HILLARY CLINTON
TO PROTECT THEM? I WOULD NOT. WOULD YOU?
>> NO!
>> DONALD TRUMP WILL CHANGE ALL
OF THAT AND MORE. HE WILL LEAD BY LEADING, NOT BY
FOLLOWING. YOU KNOW DONALD TRUMP WILL
SECURE OUR BORDERS. HIS OPPONENT HAS HAD HER CHANCE
TO DO THIS AND SHE HAS FAILED. HILLARY CLINTON IS FOR OPEN
BORDERS.
>> BOO!
>> SHE IS IN FAVOR OF EVEN TAKING SYRIAN REFUGEES EVEN
THOUGH THE ISLAMIC STATE HAS TOLD US THEY ARE GOING TO PUT
THEIR OPERATIVES IN WITH THE SYRIAN REFUGEES. OPERATIVES WHO ARE TERRORIST WHO
WILL COME TO WESTERN EUROPE AND
KILL US.
THEY HAVE TOLD US THAT AND SHE
STILL WANTS TO TAKE AN BE SYRIANS.
WE CAN'T AFFORD TO REPEAT THE
MISTAKES OF THE PAST. HILLARY CLINTON'S EXTREMISTS -- EXPERIENCE AS THE BASIS FOR HER CAMPAIGN. HILLARY CLINTON'S EXPERIENCE IS
EXACTLY THE REASON SHE SHOULD
NOT BE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED
STATES.
[CHEERING] THERE IS NO NEXT ELECTION.
THIS IS IT. THERE IS NO MORE TIME FOR US LEFT TO -- NO MORE TIME TO
REPEAT OUR MISTAKES. MISTAKE OF THE CLINTON-OBAMA
YEARS. WASHINGTON NEEDS A COMPLETE
TURNAROUND AND DONALD TRUMP IS
THE AGENT OF CHANGE AND HE WILL BE THE LEADER OF THE CHANGE WE NEED.
[CHEERING] HE WILL MAKE AMERICA ONCE AGAIN
LIKE THE PRESIDENT I WORKED FOR,
RONALD REAGAN.
[CHEERING] THE SHINING CITY ON THE HILL. VOTE FOR DONALD TRUMP FOR A SAFER AMERICA AND FOR AMERICA
HEADED IN A DIFFERENT DIRECTION. GREATNESS!
[CHEERING] GOD BLESS OUR NEXT PRESIDENT, DONALD TRUMP AND GOD BLESS THE
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA! USA!
