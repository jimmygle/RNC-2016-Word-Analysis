<strong>Phillip G. Ruffin</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> HELLO. NOW I HAVE BEEN FRIENDS WITH DONALD TRUMP FOR 20 YEARS AND BUSINESS PARTNERS.
I CAN TELL YOU THAT HIS BRAND IS UNBELIEVABLE. DONALD'S WORD IS<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> HIS BOND. IF DONALD TELLS YOU SOMETHING, YOU PUT IT IN THE BANK. HE HAS BEEN MY PARTNER AND FRIEND AND BELIEVE ME, HIS HANDSHAKE IS BETTER THAN ANY
CONTRACT WILL EVER WRITE.
[CHEERING] INNOVATOR. ENTREPRENEUR. NO ONE IN BUSINESS WORKS HARDER THAN DONALD COME. SOMETIMES HE WORKS 20 HOURS A
DAY, I WORRY ABOUT HIM. HE CAN SEE THINGS THAT OTHERS
CANNOT SEE.
YOU LOOK AT A DEAL, HE WILL MAKE
SOMETHING INCREDIBLE OUT OF IT. WE WERE IN NEW YORK ON PARK AVENUE AND 58TH, THERE WAS A
BUILDING CALLED THE GE BUILDING
COULD I DO NOT LIKE IT.
I'LL BOUGHT IT, MADE
200-300,000,000 DOLLARS ON THE
DEAL.
THAT IS WHAT HE DOES. PALM BEACH, WITH ROBERT KRAFT,
DONALD HAS A -- HAD A HOUSE ON
THE OCEAN, HE PAID $40 MILLION
FOR IT. I DO NOT LIKE IT.
I THOUGHT IT WAS A MESS.
HE SOLD IT FOR $100 BILLION. SHOWS YOU WHAT I KNOW. AS A RESULT OF HIS VISION, HE HAS PUT TENS OF THOUSANDS OF
AMERICAN WORKERS TO WORK.
[CHEERING] AND THESE ARE HIGH PAID JOBS ARE
CONSTRUCTED. IF ANY OF YOU DO CONSTRUCTION, YOU KNOW 40-50 DOLLARS AN HOUR
IS NOT UNUSUAL. HE HAS DONE THIS IN MANY OF THE NATION'S GREATEST STATES. CHICAGO, HE HAS DONE IN CHICAGO.
[CHEERING] NEW YORK, WHERE IS NEW YORK? YOU KNOW WHAT HE DOES IN NEW
YORK.
[CHEERING] HIS NAME IS ALL OVER THE PLACE. MIAMI, WHERE IS MIAMI?
HE JUST BOUGHT A COUNTRY CLUB
THERE, YOU KNOW WHAT HE DOES, HE
LOVES FLORIDA.
[CHEERING] LET ME TIE ABOUT LAS VEGAS,
NEVADA.
-- TELL YOU ABOUT LAS VEGAS,
NEVADA.
[CHEERING] ONE OF THE DEALS WE DID
TOGETHER. WE BUILT THE TRUMP INTERNATIONAL
HOTEL IN LAS VEGAS. BEAUTIFUL HOTEL. ALL THE AMENITIES.
HE KNOWS HOW TO BUILD.
HE BUILDS THEM WITH DETAIL. AMONGST 1300 UNITS AND THEY WERE SOLD OUT IN 90 DAYS.
90 DAYS. THAT WAS 2007. 2008, NO ONE COULD CLOSE. THE RECESSION HIT. THE BANK SHUT DOWN. WE WERE STUCK. 75%. 35% OF THEM WERE EMPTY.
$500 BILLION IN DEBT.
WHAT DO YOU DO? DONALD DOES NOT GIVE UP. HE SAYS, LET'S GO FORWARD WITH
THIS PROJECT. WE WILL PUT THE MONEY AND, WE
WILL MAKE THE DAMN THING WORKED AND IT DID.
[CHEERING] BY THE WAY, WE PUT IN 39 APIECE.
-- $30 MILLION IN APIECE. I BELIEVE IN HIM. HE IS TOUGH, SMART, KNOWS WHAT
HE IS DOING. ALWAYS PAYS HIS BILLS PROMPTLY. PROBABLY. NO DISCOUNTS. NOBODY LOST ANY MONEY. TODAY, WE HAVE 80% SOLD, NOTE THAT, -- NO DEBT, AND WE'RE
GOING TO MAKE A LOT OF MONEY.
IT HAS BECOME A HUGE SUCCESS. HE WANTS TO DO THE SAME THING
FOR THE COUNTRY.
[CHEERING] BELIEVE ME, HE WILL. HIS MIND WORKS LIKE THAT. INSTEAD OF THINKING OF DONALD TRUMP, HE WILL THINK OF THE
COUNTRY. HE IS A DEVELOPER, EXTRAORDINARY, ENTREPRENEUR LIKE
NOBODY YOU HAVE EVER SEEN, HE IS A LEADER.
HE WANTS TO LEAD THIS COUNTRY. WHEN HE FIRST TOLD ME, WE WERE OUT MAR A LAGO AND HE TOLD ME HE WOULD RUN FOR PRESIDENT, SAID DONALD, ARE YOU SURE YOU WANT TO
DO THIS? YOUR KING OF THE WORLD. YOU HAVE EVERYTHING YOU WANT. WHY WOULD YOU WANT TO DO THIS? HE SAID, I LOVE AMERICA, OUR
SYSTEM IS BROKEN AND I AM GOING TO FIX IT.
[CHEERING] THAT IS WHAT AMERICA NEEDS NOW. A FIGHTER, INNOVATOR, SOMEONE
WHO KNOWS WHAT IS GOING ON AND
DONALD CAN DO IT ALL.
I KNOW HIM LIKE A BROTHER. I LOVE THE MAN.
HE WILL MAKE THIS COUNTRY GREAT
AGAIN. GO DONALD, SEE YOU IN
WASHINGTON, A TSUNAMI IS COMING
AND ITS NAME IS DONALD TRUMP.
[CHEERING] THANK YOU.
