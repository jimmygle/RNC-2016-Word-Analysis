<strong>Libby Szabo</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> HELLO.
IT IS AN HONOR TO HAVE THE
OPPORTUNITY TO STAND ON THE SAME STAGE WHERE MANY OTHER GREAT
AMERICANS WILL STAND THE NEXT
FEW DAYS. I WOULD LIKE<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> TO TELL YOU A
LITTLE BIT ABOUT MY AMERICAN DREAMS.
IT STARTED ON THE LEFT SIDE OF UNDER WHERE MY MOM KNEW THE IMPORTANCE OF PRESERVING MY
LATINA HERITAGE, BUT ALWAYS MADE SURE I KNEW I WAS AN AMERICAN. WE BELIEVED IN HONESTY, INTEGRITY, AND THAT IF WE WORK HARD AND MADE THE METS -- MADE
THE MOST OF OUR OPPORTUNITIES,
WE WOULD PROSPER. WE PRIDE OURSELVES IN EARNING OUR WAYS AND NOT GETTING ANYTHING HANDED TO US. I WAS TAUGHT TO OBEY THE RULES
EVEN WHEN I DIDN'T LIKE THEM. NOW, AS AN ELECTED OFFICIAL CHARGED WITH MAKING THE RULES,
I'M EVEN MORE AWARE THAT NOT
FOLLOWING THEM SHOWS A LACK OF INTEGRITY. SADLY, WE ALL KNOW WHO THINKS SHE IS ABOVE THE RULES. WE HAVE STRONG BELIEFS IN GOD AND AMERICA. WE VALUE LIFE AND THE LISTINGS OF OUR LIBERTY. WE PURSUE OUR OWN HAPPINESS. IT WAS NEVER GIVEN TO US.
WE EARNED IT. IF WE WANT TO PRESERVE THE WAY
OF LIFE MY PARENTS AND
GRANDPARENTS MADE POSSIBLE FOR
ME AND SO MANY OTHERS, WE CANNOT HAVE ANOTHER FOUR YEARS. HILLARY CLINTON WOULD GIVE US JUST THAT. ALTHOUGH SHE TRIES TO DISGUISE IT IN A BRIGHTLY COLORED
PANTSUIT. WE NEED NEW LEADERSHIP, BOLD LEADERSHIP WILLING TO TACKLE EVERYTHING FROM NATIONAL SECURITY TO OUR ENERGY
INDEPENDENCE. LEADERSHIP THAT UNDERSTANDS WE,
THE PEOPLE ARE THE ANSWERS TO
OUR PROBLEMS, NOT THE
GOVERNMENT.
[APPLAUSE] THE CHOICE IS OURS.
AS RONALD REAGAN SO ELOQUENTLY SAID, AMERICA WEST BEST DAYS ARE
YET TO COME. OUR PROUDEST MOMENTS ARE YET TO BE. OUR MOST GLORIOUS ACHIEVEMENTS ARE JUST AHEAD. IF YOU BELIEVE THAT AS I DO, LET US MAKE AMERICA GREAT. GOD BLESS YOU AND GOD BLESS
AMERICA.
