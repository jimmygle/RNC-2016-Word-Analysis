<strong>Dana White</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> DANA WHITE: WHAT'S UP, G.O.P.?
MY NAME IS DANA WHITE.
I'M THE PRESIDENT OF THE  
ULTIMATE FIGHTING CHAMPIONSHIP. 
THANK YOU. I'M SURE MOST OF YOU ARE<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'>  
WONDERING, WHAT ARE YOU

I AM NOT A POLITICIAN, I AM A
FIGHT PROMOTER. BUT I AM HONORED TO BE HERE
TONIGHT. I WANTED TO SHOW UP AND TELL YOU
ABOUT MY FRIEND, DONALD TRUMP. THE DONALD TRUMP THAT I KNOW. IN 2001, MY PARTNERS AND I BOUGHT UFC. IT WAS CONSIDERED A BLOODSPORT. THE STATE ATHLETIC COMMISSION DID NOT SUPPORT US. ARENAS REFUSED TO HOST OUR
EVENTS. NOBODY TOOK US SERIOUSLY, NOBODY. EXCEPT DONALD TRUMP.
[APPLAUSE] DONALD WAS THE FIRST GUY THAT
RECOGNIZED THE POTENTIAL THAT WE
SAW IN THE UFC AND ENCOURAGED US
TO BUILD OUR BUSINESS. THE HOSTED OUR FIRST 2 EVENTS AT HIS VENUE, DON'T WITH US PERSONALLY, GOT IN THE TRENCHES,
AND MADE A DEAL THAT WORKED FOR EVERYONE.
ON TOP OF THAT, HE SHOWED UP FOR THE FIGHT ON SATURDAY NIGHT AND SAT IN THE FRONT ROW. YEAH. HE IS THAT GUY THAT SHOWS
UP. DONALD CHAMPIONED THE UFC BEFORE
IT WAS POPULAR, BEFORE IT GREW
INTO A SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS. AND I WILL ALWAYS BE GRATEFUL, SO GRATEFUL TO HIM FOR STANDING WITH US IN THOSE EARLY DAYS. TONIGHT I STAND WITH DONALD
TRUMP.
[APPLAUSE] LET ME TELL YOU THREE THINGS
THAT I RESPECT ABOUT THIS MAN. FIRST, DONALD HAD GREAT BUSINESS
INSTINCTS. HE SUPPORTS BUSINESSES OF ALL
SIZES. HE WILL MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR
THEM TO GROW AND SUCCEED, WHICH
IS THE BACKBONE OF A STRONG
ECONOMY. SECOND, DONALD IS A HARD WORKER.
HE WILL WORK WITH PEOPLE. HE WILL PUT IN THE TIME TO GET
THINGS DONE. THIRD, FOR OVER 15 YEARS, DONALD
TRUMP HAS BEEN A LOYAL AND SUPPORTIVE FRIEND. I KNOW THAT IF I NEEDED DONALD,
HE WOULD BE THERE FOR ME JUST
LIKE YOU WAS WHEN I FIRST MET HIM.
THESE ONE OF THOSE GUYS THAT SOMETIMES HE WILL CALL ME AND
SAY, GOOD LUCK WITH THE FIGHT
TONIGHT, I WILL BE WATCHING. AND HE ALWAYS REACHES OUT TO ME WHEN SOMETHING HAS HAPPENED IN MY CAREER. BACK IN 2011 WE SIGNED A HUGE NETWORK TV DEAL WITH FOX. THEY DID A BIG RIGHT UP IN THE
NEW YORK TIMES.
DONALD WROTE ON THE FRONT OF THE PAPER "CONGRATULATIONS DANA, I
ALWAYS KNEW YOU WERE GOING TO DO
IT." ODONALD HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH MY BUSINESS.
HIS INTEREST IN MY BUSINESS IS
PERSONAL. IN MY OPINION, YOU CAN TELL A
PERSON'S TRUE CHARACTER WHEN
THEY ARE HAPPY FOR SOMEONE ELSE'S SUCCESS.
[APPLAUSE] I THINK THAT SENSE OF LOYALTY AND COMMITMENT WILL TRANSLATE
INTO HOW HE WILL RUN THIS
COUNTRY. LET'S BE HONEST, WE NEED SOMEONE WHO BELIEVES, IS PROUD OF, AND
WILL FIGHT FOR THIS COUNTRY.
[APPLAUSE] I HAVE BEEN IN THE FIGHT
BUSINESS MY WHOLE LIFE. I KNOW FIGHTERS. LADIES AND ROMAN, DONALD TRUMP
IS A FIGHTER, AND I KNOW HE WILL
FIGHT FOR THIS COUNTRY.
[APPLAUSE] THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
HAVE A GREAT.
-- A GREAT EVENING.</span><span class='hidden-full-transcript-ellipses'>...</span></p><a href='#' class='hidden-full-transcript-link'><i class='icon-chevron-down'></i> <span class='link-show-full-text'>Show Full Text</span><i class='icon-chevron-up'></i> <span class='link-show-less-text'>Show Less Text</span></a>

<strong>Asa Hutchinson</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> GOV. HUTCHINSON: BY HAIL FROM
THE GREAT STATE OF ARKANSAS. WE KNOW FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE
THAT WE DON'T NEED HILLARY CLINTON IN THE WHITE HOUSE.
[APPLAUSE]<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> I HAVE BEEN IN THE PUBLIC ARENA
DURING THE ADMINISTRATION OF SIX PRESIDENTS, FROM FEDERAL
PROSECUTOR UNDER PRESIDENT REAGAN, TO CONGRESS, THE DEA,
THEN HOMELAND SECURITY AFTER
9/11. I HAVE SEEN AMERICA AT ITS BEST. I HAVE SEEN AMERICA PUT TO THE TEST. THERE HAS NEVER BEEN A MORE
URGENT TIME FOR LEADERSHIP. AMERICA'S STRENGTH AND BOLDNESS
ARE DESPERATELY NEEDED ON THE
WORLD STAGE. A NEW ENERGY IS DEMANDED AT HOME
TO BUILD OUR ECONOMY AND DEFEAT TERRORISM. STRENGTH, BOLDNESS, AND A NEW
ENERGY ARE NOT WORDS THAT DESCRIBE HILLARY CLINTON.
[APPLAUSE] THIS IS THE SAME HILLARY WE KNEW IN ARKANSAS AND LATER IN WASHINGTON FOR SO MANY YEARS. HILLARY ALWAYS WANTED MORE GOVERNMENT. HER DREAMS HAVE ONLY GOTTEN
BIGGER. REGRETFULLY SHE OFFERS MORE OF
THE SAME. THE SAME UNCERTAIN LEADERSHIP IN
FIGHTING TERRORISM.
THE SAME UNFILLED TOP-DOWN
APPROACH TO HEALTH CARE. WHERE WASHINGTON TELLS THE
STATES WHAT TO DO. THE SAME MANY STATE REGULATIONS
THAT STRANGLED THE ECONOMIC
STRENGTH OF AMERICA. IF YOU LIKED THE LAST 8 YEARS,
THEN HILLARY WILL GIVE YOU
DOUBLE FOR YOUR TROUBLE. GOOD THINGS ARE HAPPENING IN THE
STATE. IN ARKANSAS WE ARE CREATING JOBS
AND LEAVING IN COMPUTER SCIENCE
EDUCATION. UNEMPLOYMENT IS THE LOWEST IN
THE RECORDED HISTORY OF ARKANSAS. WE HAVE $177 MILLION SURPLUS. WE CAN DO BETTER FOR OUR COUNTRY
AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL. NEED A PRESIDENT THAT VALUES THE
ROLE OF THE STATES, WILL DESTROY ISIS, AND JUMPSTART OUR ECONOMY. ON THE PAIN TRAIL, HILLARY CLINTON EMPHASIZED HER EXPERIENCE. YES, EXPERIENCE MATTERS, BUT JUDGMENT MATTERS MORE. DESPITE HER EXPERIENCE, HILLARY
CLINTON'S POOR DECISIONS HAVE PRODUCED THAT RESULTS.
-- BAD RESULTS. JUST THINK ABOUT IT.
HILLARY CLINTON'S RADICAL
ATTEMPTS AT SO-CALLED REFORM OF
THE NATION'S HEALTH CARE SYSTEM
WOULD HAVE BEEN MORE DESTRUCTIVE
THAN EVEN OBAMACARE HAS BEEN. HILLARY CLINTON'S BAD JUDGMENT,
AS YOU HEARD LAST NIGHT, LEFT US FOUR DEAD AMERICANS IN BENGHAZI. INSTABILITY IN EGYPT, SYRIA AND
EGYPT, THE RISE OF. ISIS AND IN BOLD AND NORTH KOREA,
INAPPROPRIATE TIES BETWEEN
FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS AND THE CLINTON FOUNDATION, AND A MORE DANGEROUS WORLD. WHEN IT COMES TO BEGIN COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF, WE DON'T
WANT A PRESIDENT WHO, IN THE WORDS OF THE FBI, IS EXTREMELY CARELESS IN THE HANDLING OF
CLASSIFIED MATERIAL.
[APPLAUSE] DONALD TRUMP REPRESENTS A DIFFERENT KIND OF LEADERSHIP. HE IS EXACTLY THE KIND OF TRANSPARENT, STRAIGHT TALKING
LEADER AMERICA NEEDS RIGHT NOW. A HILLARY CLINTON RESIDENCY WILL ENDANGER OUR NATIONAL SECURITY. IT WILL BE THE WRONG DIRECTION FOR OUR ECONOMY AND WILL
UNDERMINE INNOVATION FROM THE
STRAITS.
A TRUMP PRESIDENCY WILL BE ABOUT
THE ART OF THE POSSIBLE. DONALD TRUMP IS THE RIGHT LEADER
FOR OUR TIME. MIKE PENCE IS THE RIGHT LEADER
FOR OUR TIME. THANK YOU, GOD BLESS AMERICA.
