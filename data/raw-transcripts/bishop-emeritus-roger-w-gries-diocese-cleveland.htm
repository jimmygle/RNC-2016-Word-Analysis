UNITED IN RECOGNITION<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> THAT YOU
ARE THE CREATOR OF ALL THAT IS. YOU MOVE ON A SCALE AND IN WAYS THAT WE CAN SCARCELY COMPREHEND, BUT YOUR GRACE AND LOVE REACHED

YOU TO BLESS BUT WE HAVE DESIGNED.
-- WHAT WE HAVE DESIGNED. WE ARE HERE TO ASK YOU TO TRANSFORM US, TO MAKE US BETTER, MAKE US COURAGEOUS, MAKE US TIRELESS IN SEEKING A MORE JUST NATION FOR ALL WHO LIVE IN THIS
LAND. WE ARE UNITED IN OUR DISCONTENT,
FOR WE KNOW THE WORLD CAN BE
MADE BETTER. WE KNOW THAT IT IS NOT RIGHT
THAT RACISM CONTINUES TO WOUND
AND DESTROY THE LIVES OF MANY IN THIS LAND

TO INSTABILITY RECEIVED AT THE
GROCERY STORE OR ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES, WE KNOW THAT WE WILL
ONLY BE A GREAT NATION WHEN WE
ARE A GOOD NATION. WHEN EVERY CITIZEN IS FULLY
VESTED IN THE PROMISE OF CITIZENSHIP AND SHARES IN THE
OPPORTUNITIES OF THIS GREAT
LAND. WE KNOW THAT IT IS NOT RIGHT
WHEN LIVES ARE DESTROYED BY ADDICTION, WHEN OUR JUSTICE SYSTEM FAVOR SOME PUNISHES OTHER, WHEN CHILDREN AND WOMEN ARE TRAFFICKED IN OUR STREETS OR
WHEN PEOPLE ARE DENIGRATED BECAUSE OF WHO THEY ARE, OR WHOM
THEY LOVE. WE KNOW THAT IT IS NOT RIGHT WHEN WE STAND IN THE STREETS AND
SHOUT INSULTS AT EACH OTHER, WHEN WE ATTACKED THOSE WHO RISK THEIR LIVES TO PROTECT US, WHEN
WE HARDEN OUR HEARTS TO THOSE WE
CALL THE ENEMY, WHEN WE CAN NO
LONGER FIND COMMON GROUND UPON WHICH WE CAN BUILD A BETTER
FUTURE, FORGIVE US GOD, ETERNAL
GOD, HOPE OF ALL WHO CALL OUT TO YOU, WORKED FOR OUR LEADERS WHO
HAVE BEEN ENTRUSTED TO ACT ON
OUR BEHALF. REMIND US THAT AS WE WIELDED
GREAT POWER, WE ALSO BEAR GREAT
RESPONSIBILITY. REMIND US THAT EACH OF OUR LIVES MATTERS, OUR VOICE, OUR EXAMPLE, OUR VALUES AND OUR SERVICE. MAY WE EACH BEATIFIC POINT WHERE THE WORLD SWINGS FROM WHAT IS TO WHAT IT CAN BE.
YOU BY DIFFERENT NAMES, WE MAY PRAY IN DIFFERENT LANGUAGES, WE
MAY COME FROM A MULTITUDE OF PERSPECTIVES, BUT TONIGHT, WE
SHARE THIS MOMENT IN HISTORY AS WE LIVE TOGETHER ON THIS FRAGILE PLANET. GIVE US GRACE, IT WAS COURAGE,
GIVE US COMPASSION AND GIVE US
HOPE.

<p class='short_transcript'> >> LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, YOU MAY
BE SEATED. I'M HERE SPEAKING TONIGHT IN MY PERSONAL CAPACITY, NOT ON BEHALF OF ANY OF THE NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS THAT<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> I LEAD. WE HAVE GATHERED HERE IN
CLEVELAND TO SELECT THE
REPUBLICAN NOMINEE FOR PRESIDENT
AND WE HAVE ACCOMPLISHED THAT
MISSION. DONALD TRUMP IS THE NOMINEE OF
THE REPUBLICAN PARTY.
[CHEERING] AND I WILL BE VOTING FOR DONALD TRUMP IN  NOVEMBER AND I WILL URGE MY FELLOW AMERICANS TO DO
THE SAME.
[CHEERING] ALLOW ME TO EXPLAIN WHY. TONIGHT WE FOCUS ON MAKING
AMERICA ONE AGAIN. IN THE PLEDGE THAT WE JUST RECITED, WE SAID WE ARE ONE NATION UNDER GOD. CONGRESS ADDED THE WORDS UNDER
GOD TO THE PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE IN 1954. THE CONTEXT IN WHICH THOSE WORDS WERE ADDED AS INSTRUCTED, THE
COLD WAR HAS BEGUN, AS A NATION
WE FACE AN EXISTENTIAL THREAT,
YOU MIGHT REMEMBER CHILDREN
PRACTICE THE ART OF DR. AND
COVER IN CLASSROOMS ACROSS THE COUNTRY FEARING NUCLEAR ATTACKS.
THE THREAT TO OUR NATION'S SURVIVAL WAS REAL.
IT WAS JUST AS REAL THAN AS IT
IS TODAY. THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT PRESIDENT EISENHOWER KNEW WHERE TO PLACE AMERICA'S TRUST AND UPON HEARING A SERMON BY REVEREND GEORGE DOCKERY, PRESIDENT EISENHOWER PROMPTED CONGRESS TO ADOPT THE
WORDS UNDER GOD. REVEREND DR. JIHAD POINTED TO
THE WORDS OF THE FIRST -- REVEREND DOCKERY POINTED TO THE
WORDS OF THE FIRST GROUP, LINCOLN SAID UNDER GOD PEOPLE SHALL KNOW A NEW BIRTH OF
FREEDOM. A LOT HAS CHANGED SINCE THEN. BUT THE SOURCE OF AMERICA'S HOPE
AND FUTURE HAS NOT. IT IS FOUND IN THE SAME PLACE
TODAY AS IT WAS IN 1863 AND
1954, UNDER GOD.
[CHEERING] BUT MY FRIENDS ARE -- FREEDOMS
THAT APPEAL TO UNITE UNDER GOD
HAS BEEN UNDER STUDY ASSAULT. THIS IS WHY WE MUST STOP THOSE
IN OUR GOVERNMENT AND OUR COURTS
TO HAVE EITHER IN PRINCIPLE OR PRACTICE ATTEMPTED TO REMOVE
THESE TWO WORDS UNDER GOD AND
ALL THAT THEY MEAN FROM PUBLIC
LIFE HERE IN AMERICA.
[APPLAUSE] FROM HIS JUDICIAL NOMINEES TO
HIS RUNNING MATE, TO THE PARTY PLATFORM AND THE POLICIES IT
PROMOTES, DONALD TRUMP HAS COMMITTED TO UPHOLDING AND PROTECTING THE FIRST FREEDOM AND
THEREFORE OUR ABILITY --
[CHEERING] AND THEREFORE OUR ABILITY AS CITIZENS TO UNITE OUR NATION ONCE AGAIN UNDER GOD. LET US GO FORTH FROM HERE AND DO
THAT WORK. THANK YOU AND GOD BLESS YOU.

<strong>Unidentified Speaker</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> I'M SO HONORED AND HUMBLED TO
BE HERE TONIGHT. IN 1984, A FATHER STOOD AT THIS CONVENTION AND OFFERED THE OPENING PRAYER BEFORE OUR PARTY'S CANDIDATE,<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> RONALD REAGAN
, WENT ON TO ACCEPT THE NOMINATION AND WIN IN A
LANDSLIDE.
[CHEERING] A LITTLE OVER 30 YEARS LATER, I STAND HERE WITH THE SINCEREST PRAYER THAT HISTORY IS ABOUT TO REPEAT ITSELF WITH THE ELECTION
OF DONALD J TRUMP.
[CHEERING] YOU KNOW, MOST OF OUR NATION'S
ELDERS HAD STRONG FACE AS I DO
IN OUR LORD AND SAVIOR, JESUS
CHRIST.
[CHEERING] MY FAMILY HAS LIVED IN VIRGINIA
SINCE THE 1500S AND LYNCHBURG, VIRGINIA SINCE 1834. MY WIFE IS A DESCENDENT OF GEORGE WASHINGTON'S FAMILY.
EVERY DAY I DRIVE PAST THE SUMMER HOME OF THOMAS JEFFERSON WHO WROTE IN THE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE WE ARE ENDOWED BY
OUR CREATOR WITH CERTAIN
UNALIENABLE RIGHTS AND AMONG
THESE ARE LIFE, LIBERTY, AND THE
PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS.
[CHEERING] OUR FOUNDING FATHERS ENVISIONED
A GOVERNMENT THAT EXISTED ONLY TO PROTECT THESE GOD-GIVEN RIGHTS AND A NATION GOVERNED BY
CITIZEN LEGISLATORS. THE MOST EFFECTIVE POLICIES WHOSE -- POLITICIANS WHENEVER CAREER POLITICIANS, BUT
SURVEYORS, ARCHITECTS, MINISTERS, FARMERS, IF THIS MEN
AND EVEN ACTORS WHO ARE SUCCESSFUL IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR
BEFORE SERVING IN GOVERNMENT. DONALD TRUMP FOLLOWS IN THIS
RICH TRADITION. HE HAS CREATED JOBS FOR THOUSANDS AND IS ONE OF THE GREATEST VISIONARIES OF OUR
TIME.
[CHEERING] I FIRST SUPPORTED MR. DRUM AFTER I SPENT 20 YEARS AS A YOUNG LAWYER WORKING WITH MY FATHER TO
RESTORE LIBERTY UNIVERSITY TO
FINANCIAL HEALTH. SINCE 2007, LIBERTY HAS BECOME
THE MOST LARGEST AND LESS
PROSPEROUS CHRISTIAN UNIVERSITY
IN THE WORLD. I'M CONVINCED THAT DONALD TRUMP
CAN WORK THE SAME MAGIC FOR A NATION WITH $19 TRILLION IN
DEBT.
[CHEERING] MY FAMILY AND I HAVE GROWN TO
LOVE AND RESPECT THE TRUMPS FOR
OTHER REASONS.
WE HAVE NEVER MET SUCH A GENUINE
AND LOVING FAMILY, I TRULY BELIEVE MR. TRUMP IS AMERICA'S
BLUE-COLLAR BILLIONAIRE.
[CHEERING] HE IS DOWN TO EARTH, LOVES AMERICA AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. HE IS A TRUE PATRIOT AND A
CHAMPION OF THE COMMON MAN. MR. TRUMP HAS ADDED A PLANK TO
THIS PARTY PLATFORM TO REPEAL
IRS RULES SPONSORED BY LYNDON JOHNSON IN 1954 BARRING CHURCHES AND NONPROFIT FROM EXPRESSING POLITICAL FREE SPEECH.
[CHEERING] CONSERVATIVE UNIVERSITIES AND
CHURCHES HAVE BEEN INVESTIGATED WHILE AUTHORITIES HAVE TO OFTEN
TURNED A BLIND EYE TOWARDS
LIBERAL GROUPS, INCLUDING UNIVERSITIES WERE LEFT-WING IDEOLOGY IS SO PERVASIVE THAT THEY HAVE AN EFFECT BECOME DEMOCRATIC VOTER INDOCTRINATION
CAMPS. TRUST ME, THE REPEAL OF THE JOHNSON AMENDMENT WILL CREATE A HUGE REVOLUTION FOR CONSERVATIVE CHRISTIANS AND FOR FREE SPEECH.
[CHEERING] WE ARE AT A CROSSROADS WHERE OUR FIRST PRIORITY MUST BE SAVING
OUR NATION. WE MUST UNITE BEHIND DONALD
TRUMP AND MIKE PENCE.
[CHEERING] IF YOU ARE A CONSERVATIVE, A
DECISION NOT TO VOTE OR TO VOTE
FOR A THIRD-PARTY CANDIDATE IS A
DE FACTO VOTE FOR HILLARY
CLINTON.
[CHEERING] IF HILLARY CLINTON IS ALLOWED TO
APPOINT THE NEXT SUPREME COURT JUSTICES, THAT IN ITSELF COULD BE A FATAL BLOW TO OUR REPUBLIC. ON THE OTHER HAND, A VOTE FOR DONALD TRUMP IS A VOTE TO UPHOLD
THE SECOND AMENDMENT RIGHT TO
BEAR ARMS.
[CHEERING] A VOTE FOR DONALD TRUMP IS A BUS TO STOP IRAN, AND NATION
COMMITTED TO THE DESTRUCTION OF
THE STATE OF ISRAEL FROM BECOMING A NUCLEAR POWER. A VOTE FOR DONALD TRUMP IS A VOTE TO APPOINT CONSERVATIVE PRO-LIFE JUSTICES TO THE SUPREME COURT.
[CHEERING] IN THE DAYS BEFORE MY FATHER PASSED AWAY, HE JOKED WITH CNN
THAT HE DREAMED THAT CHELSEA CLINTON HAD INTERVIEWED HIM
ABOUT THE 30 GREATEST THREATS -- THREE GREATEST THREAT FACING THE
NATION. HE REPLIED THAT THEY ARE OSAMA, OBAMA, AND YO' MAMA.
[CHEERING] WELL, OSAMA IS NOW GONE, OBAMA
HAS SIX MONTHS LEFT --
[CHEERING] AND THE ONLY WAY TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AND ONE AGAIN IS TO TELL CHELSEA'S MAMA YOU ARE FIRED.
[CHEERING] AND THE ONLY WAY TO DO THAT IS
TO ELECT DONALD TRUMP AND MIGHT HENCE PRESIDENT AND VICE
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.
-- MIKE PENCE PRESIDENT AND VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.
[CHEERING] THANK YOU AND GOD BLESS YOU AND
GOD BLESS AMERICA!

[CHEERING] I HAVE SPENT 55 YEARS IN LAW ENFORCEMENT, 55 YEARS<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> AND HAVE ALWAYS REGARDED MY WORK, THE MISSION IS CRITICAL, BUT MY MOST
IMPORTANT MISSION HAS JUST BEGUN, TO HELP ELECT DONALD
TRUMP.
[CHEERING] PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.
[CHEERING] THE STAKES ARE HIGH. WE NEED A STRONG LEADER WHO WILL
STAND UP FOR AMERICA AND PUT THE
INTEREST OF HER CITIZENS FIRST. UNFORTUNATELY, WE ARE LOSING THE BATTLE.
WE'RE THE ONLY COUNTRY IN THE WORLD WHOSE IMMIGRATION SYSTEM
PUTS THE NEEDS OF OTHER NATIONS
AHEAD OF OURS. WE ARE MORE CONCERNED WITH THE
RIGHTS OF ILLEGAL ALIENS AND CRIMINALS FAMILY ARE WITH
REJECTING OUR OWN COUNTRY.
[CHEERING]
-- PROTECTING OUR OWN COUNTRY. THAT MUST CHANGE.
WE NEED A LEADER WHO WILL
PROTECT OUR BORDERS AND ENFORCE OUR LAWS BECAUSE A NATION WITHOUT BORDERS AND A NATION WITHOUT LAWS IS NO NATION AT ALL.
[CHEERING] AND NOW, MORE THAN EVER, WE MUST RESPECT THE POLICE.
[CHEERING] WE MUST GIVE THEM THE TOOLS AND
THE SUPPORT THEY NEED TO DO
THEIR JOBS. THE HIGHEST LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT
MUST HAVE OUR BACKS AS THEY RISK
THEIR LIVES EVERYTHING OK TO
PERFORM THEIR JOBS AND PROTECT OUR CITIZENS. AS SOMEONE WHO FOR 35 YEARS HAS BEEN A TOP ONE FOURTH THE
OFFICIAL LIVING AND WORKING ON BOTH SIDES OF THE BORDER, I CAN TELL YOU FIRSTHAND ABOUT THE
DANGERS OF ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION AND DRUGS.
WE HAVE TERRORISTS COMING OVER
OUR BORDERS. INFILTRATING OUR COMMUNITIES AND CAUSING MASSIVE DESTRUCTION AND
MAYHEM. WE HAVE CRIMINALS AND DETERGENT OR WEAK BORDER -- PENETRATING OUR WEAK BORDER SYSTEM AND COMMITTING CRIMES.
I'M SUPPORTING DONALD TRUMP
BECAUSE HE IS A LEADER.
[CHEERING] HE PRODUCES RESULTS.
HE IS THE ONLY CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT READY TO GET TOUGH IN
ORDER TO PROTECT AMERICANS.
[CHEERING] I HAVE THOUGHTS ON THE FRONT
LINES TO PREVENT ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION AND I KNOW DONALD TRUMP WILL STAND WITH ME AND
OTHER PROUD AMERICANS TO SECURE OUR BORDERS.
[CHEERING] DONALD TRUMP WILL BUILD A WALL.
[CHEERING] AND RESTORE LAW AND ORDER AND KEEP DRUGS AND ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS FROM ENTERING INTO
OUR COUNTRY.
[CHEERING] I WILL NEVER FORGET DONALD TRUMP
AND WHAT HE DID FOR MY WIFE. I'VE BEEN MARRIED TO EVA FOR 59 YEARS.
[CHEERING] AND DURING THE CAMPAIGN, SHE WAS
DIAGNOSED WITH CANCER. JUST BEFORE GOING ON NATIONAL TV, DONALD TRUMP CALLED MY WIFE
AND TALK TO HER FOR FIVE MINUTES. SUBSEQUENT TRIPS, HE NEVER
FORGOT TO THINK OF MY WIFE. AND CALL HER. HE DID NOT HAVE TO GET MY SUPPORT THROUGH HIS KINDNESS TO MY WIFE BECAUSE I WAS ALREADY HOOKED.
[CHEERING] LET'S ELECT A LEADER WHO WILL
STAND UP FOR AMERICA.
[CHEERING] AND PROTECT OUR BORDERS. SUPPORT LAW ENFORCEMENT.
[CHEERING] AND THE MILITARY!
[CHEERING] AND IN DOING SO, UNITE OUR COUNTRY.
[CHEERING] LET'S ELECT DONALD TRUMP!

WAS SO QUIET.
[LAUGHTER] HE WAS HUMBLE HE WAS IN PRAYER AND I PUT<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> MY HAND ON HIS HEAD
AND HIS SHOULDER AND HIS HEART AND I SAID, LOSING UP.
-- LOOSEN UP. AFTER HEARING HIM BACK THERE, I
BOUGHT MY GOOD FRIEND PEYTON MANNING AND IT GETS THE DEFENSE
AND IS YELLING OMAHA! TONIGHT, I'M YELLING HELP! I KNOW OVER HERE SOMEWHERE WE
HAVE SOME MINNESOTA VIKING FANS.
[CHEERING] WE HAVE SOME NEW YORK GIANT FAN
SOMEWHERE. WEEK?
-- DON'T WE?
[CHEERING] WE HAVE SOME GEORGIA BULLDOGS? GO DOGS!
[MIXED REACTION] AND HAVE SOMETHING FOR PACKERS
FANS.
I HAVE SOMETHING FOR YOU. A GREAT STORY. THE MOST REVERED COACHING LEGEND
IN THE HISTORY OF THE NATIONAL
FOOTBALL LEAGUE IS VINCENT LOMBARDI. HE WAS A TOUGH AS NAILS
AMERICAN, LOUDLY AND BOISTEROUS
AND HE TOOK THE PACKERS, A FORLORN TEAM IN THE 50'S AND THEY WERE BROKEN AND DID NOT WIN
AND HE MADE THEM INTO A WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP TEAM YEAR AFTER YEAR. BUT AS GREAT AS HE WAS, HE DID
NOT ALWAYS WIN.
THERE IS A VIDEO ON THAT IT'S
BEEN OUT THERE FOR YEARS, IT
TELLS A STORY OF LUMBAR TO -- LOMBARDI.
HE IS ON THE SIDELINES. HE PACES LAMBEAU FIELD SIDELINED LIKE A CAGED TIGER. THE PACKERS CANNOT DO ANYTHING RIGHT THIS DAY. AND VINCE LOMBARDI WAS GOING
CRAZY. HE SCREAMS AT HIS PLAYERS
RUNNING OFF THE FIELD AND HE SAYS, WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON OUT HERE? RIGHT NOW I LOOK AT AMERICA AND
I NEED TO ASK, WHAT THE HELL IS
GOING ON HERE?
[CHEERING] THE MOST ANEMIC RECOVERY IN
MODERN HISTORY. AND WASHINGTON IS BROKEN FOR
EVERYBODY. AT LEAST BROKEN FOR EVERYBODY
WHO DOES NOT MAKE THEIR LIVING
INSIDE THE BELTWAY. WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON HERE? WE ARE STUCK IN FRUSTRATION.
MIRED IN ANGER AND FEAR.
AS A QUARTERBACK, FOR 18 YEARS,
MY MISSION WAS SIMPLE, IT WAS TO
MAKE MY TEAMMATES BETTER. OF COURSE I MADE A FORTUNE PLAYING FOOTBALL.
IN 1951, MY FIRST YEAR I MADE
$12,500. I HAD AN OFF-SEASON JOB.
I BECAME A SMALL BUSINESS OWNER. AS A SMALL BUSINESS OWNER, I
FEEL CONNECTED TO THE MILLIONS
OF AMERICANS IN THIS VITAL
CENTER OF OUR ECONOMY. LET'S GET TO THE FACTS.
SMALL BUSINESS AMERICA IS THE
HEART AND SOUL OF THE
OPPORTUNITY. THE FACTS ARE THAT 40%, LISTEN TO THIS, HE PERCENT OF 530,000 START UPS EACH MONTH ARE STARTED BY AFRICAN-AMERICANS. HISPANICS OR ASIANS. ALMOST A THIRD OF SMALL BUSINESSES IN AMERICA STARTED BY IMMIGRANTS. AND NEARLY 40% BY WOMEN. BUT THE THING IS, SMALL
BUSINESSES HAVE BEEN SURVIVING NOT BECAUSE OF GOVERNMENT POLICIES, THAT IN SPITE OF THEM.
[CHEERING] A THESE PAST EIGHT YEARS.
HIGH TAXES, STAGNANT REGULATIONS, PRACTICALLY NO
ACCESS TO CREDIT. I ASK, WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON
HERE? IMAGINE WITH ME, WHAT COULD HAPPEN IN OUR NATION IF 27 MILLION JOB CREATING ENTERPRISES WERE SUDDENLY EMPOWERED AND SET FREE IN EVERY NEIGHBORHOOD TO
GROW AND BUILD AND CONTRIBUTE EVEN MORE? I BELIEVE IT ALL COMES DOWN TO LEADERSHIP. WHETHER IT IS BEEN SOME PARTY YEARS AGO ARE THE GREAT NICK
SABIN OF ALABAMA TODAY, I CAN
TELL YOU BY SIMPLE WORDS, WHAT
EVERY GREAT LEADER DOES, A
LEADER GETS STUFF DONE.
[CHEERING] I'VE KNOWN DONALD TRUMP FOR 48 YEARS AND LIKE THOSE OTHER LEADERS, I'VE KNOWN FOR SURE
THAT HE GETS STUFF DONE.
[CHEERING] HE IS A BUILDER. HE UNDERSTANDS THAT TEAMS WHEN,
INDIVIDUALS DO NOT. HE BUILDS GREAT TEAMS. DONALD TRUMP IS A PROVEN LEADER. A TEAM BUILDER. DONALD TRUMP KNOWS HOW TO GET
THE BEST OUT OF PEOPLE, HOW TO
BE A TEAMMATE. I'VE WATCHED HIM OVER THOSE 48
YEARS SUCCEED WILDLY.
I'VE WATCHED AND FAIL BECAUSE
ALL OF US FAIL.
I'VE WATCHED HIM GET BACK UP
BECAUSE HE NEVER QUITS. I TRULY BELIEVE THAT DONALD
TRUMP CAN PROVIDE THE LEADERSHIP THAT WILL HELP US ALL MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN.
[CHEERING] MAKE IT GREAT. MAKE IT GREAT FOR EVERYONE. LET'S GO. YOU PEOPLE OUT THERE, LET'S GO. AND WHEN THIS GAME -- EIN THIS
-- WIN THIS GAME TOGETHER.
LET'S GO MAKE AMERICA GREAT
AGAIN. THANK YOU AND GOOD NIGHT.

DO IT ON MY OWN.
DONALD TRUMP CAN DO IT ALONE
EITHER. HE NEEDS OUR HELP AND SUPPORT. JUST AS MICHIGAN WAS WILLING TO ADOPT A BUCKEYE FOR A CAUSE

<strong>Unidentified Speaker</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> HELLO THERE, TENNESSEE.
[CHEERING] AND HELLO TO EVERYONE HERE TONIGHT AND DO ALL OF YOU WHO ARE WATCHING US AT HOME, ON IPHONES AND ON TWITTER. WELCOME.
[CHEERING]<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> I HAVE A QUESTION FOR YOU, DO YOU, DO YOU WANT TO HELP MAKE AMERICA ONE AGAIN?
[CHEERING] LET ME HEAR YOU!
[CHEERING] ALL RIGHT. WE HAVE ALL HAD ENOUGH OF
BLOATED BUDGETS, UNKEPT PROMISES
AND POINTLESS REDLINES. WE'VE HAD ENOUGH DIVISION AND
ENOUGH HE DID RHETORIC THAT SERVES TO ONLY DRIVE A WEDGE BETWEEN US AND OUR NEIGHBOR. ANOTHER SCENE OUR 401(K)S, OUR BILLS GET BIGGER IN OUR TAXES GO UP AND OUR PAYCHECK SHRINKS. IN SHORT, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE
HAVE HAD IT.
[CHEERING] AND THEY ARE READY FOR CHANGE. READY FOR SOMEONE TO TAKE THE REINS AND BRING US TOGETHER.
[CHEERING] THERE IS SOMEONE THAT CAN GET
THE JOB DONE FOR US LARRY THE
CABLE GUY WOULD SAY, LET'S GIT
'R'DONE. THERE IS SOMEONE WHO CAN COME IN AHEAD OF SCHEDULE AND UNDER BUDGET WHO HAS SEEN THE BOTTOM LINE AND NEGOTIATED THE COST AND DEALT SOMETHING TO LAST. A LEADER WHO KNOWS THAT THIS COUNTRY IS NOT FULL OF -- OUR WHO KNOWS THAT THIS
NATION IS FULL OF CITIZENS WHO
WANT A LEADER WHO KNOWS THE SURE ROUTE TO PROSPERITY, WHO INSPIRES, WHO KNOWS THAT
LEADERSHIP IS A HARD FOUGHT FOR
AND NOT A SUBJECT LINE IN AN
E-MAIL. THAT IS WHY ASKING ALL OF YOU TO JOIN ME TONIGHT AND ELECTING DONALD TRUMP AS PRESIDENT OF THE
UNITED STATES.
[CHEERING] DONALD TRUMP HAS THE SKILLS REQUIRED TO LEAD THIS NATION, A DIVERSE NATION AND HE CAN HELP OUR PEOPLE ACHIEVE GREATNESS. HE BELIEVES IN THE AMERICAN DREAM BECAUSE HE HAS LIVED THE
AMERICAN DREAM. THE DESIRE FOR GREATNESS IS NOT
NEW. PRESIDENT LINCOLN STOOD RIGHT
HERE IN THIS VERY CITY 155 YEARS AGO WITH A CALL FOR US TO BIND TOGETHER OR PARISH APART.
LISTEN TO HIS WORDS. IF ALL DO NOT JOIN NOW TO SAVE
THE GOOD SHIP OF THE UNION, NOBODY WILL HAVE A CHANCE TO
PILOT HER ON ANOTHER.
[CHEERING] AND AGAIN WE FIND OUR NATION IN
DESPERATE NEED OF TRUE LEADERSHIP, DESPERATE NEED OF
UNITY, THE LAST EIGHT YEARS HAVE
BEEN A CHALLENGE. TO OUR NATIONAL AND HOUSEHOLD BUDGET, TO OUR CONSTITUTION AND
TO THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO GIVE THEIR LIVES AND THEIR SACRED HONOR TO PROTECT THE
CONSTITUTION AND PROTECT US. WE KNOW THAT DONALD TRUMP IS A LEADER WHO ARE SEEING
CHALLENGES, HE HAS SOLVED PROBLEMS AND DELIVERED RESULTS. SOME OF OUR NATION'S GREATEST
LEADERS HAVE BEEN PEOPLE WHO
HAVE WORKED IN THE REAL WORLD
WHO KNOW FIRSTHAND HOW CUMBERSOME RULES AND UNNECESSARY REGULATION GET IN THE WAY OF
GREATNESS. I WANT A PRESIDENT WHO KNOWS THAT LEADERSHIP IS NOT AS IT APPEARS BUT AS IT PERFORMS. WHO HAS SEEN SOMETHING THROUGH FROM BEGINNING TO COMPLETION,
WHO LOOKS AT THE MUNDANE AND SEES MAGNIFICENCE. AFTER ALL, THAT IS THE MAGIC OF THIS COUNTRY. EVERY DAY PEOPLE WITH BIG IDEAS
AND THEY DREAMS AND THEY TRY TO
COMPLETE THEM, NOT ONLY CAN THEY
CHANGE OUR SKYLINE, THEY CAN CHANGE THE WORLD.
[CHEERING] LEADERSHIP IS NOT ABOUT LINES ON A RESUME, GENDER, RACE, ZIP CODE, PEDIGREE, LINEAGE, HARD
FEELINGS ARE NOT QUALIFIED FOR
LEADERSHIP. LEADERSHIP IS A RECORD OF
PERFORMANCE AND ACCOMPLISHMENT. AND TEAMBUILDING. THAT IS LEADERSHIP YOU CAN
TRUST.
[CHEERING] WE AMERICANS ARE BOUND TOGETHER
BY THE SHARED DESIRE FOR FAITH, FAMILY, FREEDOM, HOPE, AND
OPPORTUNITY. WE WANT A PRESIDENT WHO BELIEVES THAT YOU, NOT WASHINGTON,. WHO BELIEVES THAT YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO PRESERVE YOUR VERSION
OF THE AMERICAN DREAM.
[CHEERING] I KNOW YOU BELIEVE, I DO TOO,
THAT AMERICA IS ON THE EDGE OF
GREAT AND MIGHTY THINGS. WE NEED A PRESIDENT WHO UNDERSTANDS THIS AND UNDERSTAND
THIS IS ABOUT FREEDOM AND FREEDOM'S CAUSES AND UNITE US,
NOT DIVIDE US.
[CHEERING] LET ME ASK YOU ANOTHER QUESTION,
ARE YOU WITH ME?
[CHEERING] ARE YOU WITH TRUMP-PENCE 2016?
[CHEERING] TOGETHER WE CAN GET THE COUNTRY BUILDING, WORKING, JOBS COME BACK, OUR COMMUNITY GROWS AND IT
SEEMED LEADERS ACTUALLY LEAD AND TOGETHER, WITH YOU AND WITH TRUMP-PENCE 2016, WE WILL BE GREAT AGAIN, WE WILL BE ONE AGAIN. THANK YOU.
[CHEERING] GOD BLESS!

<p class='short_transcript'> >> OKLAHOMA LOVES NEW YORK, TOO! THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT, AMERICA. ARE YOU READY FOR CHANGE? ME TOO! I GREW UP IN A SMALL TOWN IN
OKLAHOMA. IT WAS ONE OF<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> THOSE ALL-AMERICAN
TOWNS WHERE EVERYONE WATCHES
HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL ON FRIDAY
NIGHT AND NEIGHBORS TAKE CARE OF NEIGHBORS.
WE UNDERSTOOD POVERTY. BUT IT WAS NOT A DESTINY THAT WAS INEVITABLE, WE WERE
OPTIMISTIC ABOUT OUR FUTURE AND
WE KNEW WE COULD SUCCEED WITH HARD WORK, A GOOD EDUCATION AND
FAITH IN GOD.
[CHEERING] THERE WEREN'T VERY MANY OPPORTUNITIES ARE YOUNG WOMEN,
BUT WE DID HAVE A RATE ROLE MODEL, A WOMAN THERE, MY MOM.
-- MAYOR, MY MOM.
[CHEERING] SHE TAUGHT ME THAT IF I WORKED HARD, I COULD BE ANYTHING. AND I TOOK THAT LESSON TO HEART
AND EVENTUALLY BECAME THE FIRST FEMALE GOVERNOR OF THE STATE OF OKLAHOMA.
[CHEERING] IN MY COMMUNITY, THERE WAS A SENSE OF OPTIMISM AND DETERMINATION THAT OUR COMMUNITY AND OUR COUNTRY COULD BE BETTER. FOR EVERYONE. IT EVEN AT A TIME WHEN THE
SHADOW OF INSTITUTIONAL
DISCRIMINATION FELL OVER MUCH OF OUR COUNTRY, THERE WAS NO SHORTAGE OF AFRICAN-AMERICAN HEROES, BLACK OKLAHOMANS LIGHT CIVIL RIGHTS LEADER CLAY LOOPER
IT WAS SUCCESSFULLY INTEGRATING
SCHOOLS ACROSS THE STATE AND
WINNING THE FIGHT FOR RESPECT
AND OPPORTUNITY.
[CHEERING] WHEN I LOOK BACK ON MY
CHILDHOOD, MY AMERICA, I DON'T SEE A PERFECT PLACE, BUT WE WERE UNITED BY A SIMPLE BELIEF THAT
NO MATTER WHO YOU WERE OR WHERE YOU CAME FROM, BETTER DAYS WERE
AHEAD FOR AMERICA.
[CHEERING] TODAY, I'M AFRAID WE ARE LOSING THAT SENSE OF UNITY AND
OPTIMISM. NOT JUST IN TOWNS LIKE TECUMSEH,
BUT ACROSS THIS LAND. OUR COUNTRY IS DIVIDED. OUR PEOPLE ARE AFRAID. AND OUR SPIRITS ARE NEARLY
BROKEN. BUT WE CAN'T LOSE THAT HOPELESSNESS AND HAVE IT BECOME
THE NEW NORMAL. IN AMERICA, WE WILL NOT.
[CHEERING] I BELIEVE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE LONGING FOR THE AMERICAN DREAM WHERE THEY CAN GET A FAIR
SHAKE IN LIFE AND AN OPPORTUNITY TO SUCCEED. WE MUST MAKE AMERICA ONE AGAIN
AND RESTORE THE STRENGTH OF OUR NATION.
[CHEERING] AND IT IS NO SECRET, DONALD TRUMP IS BOLD, TENACIOUS, COURAGEOUS AND EVEN AN OUTSPOKEN LEADER.
[CHEERING] AND HE KNOWS HOW TO CREATE JOBS
AND SUCCESSFUL BUSINESSES. HE HAS BOLD IDEAS AND HE SPEAKS TRUTH TO POWER. HE IS A MAN WHO WILL GET THIS COUNTRY ON THE RIGHT TRACK, WHO BELIEVES IN PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH AND WILL PROTECT
AMERICA AGAINST RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISTS WHO STREAK -- SEE TO
DESTROY OUR NATION.
[CHEERING] OUR COUNTRY HAS UNITED TIME AND TIME AGAIN ON OUR CORE VALUES. READ HIM, INDIVIDUAL LIBERTY AND
JUSTICE FOR ALL PEOPLE. THE PRINCIPLES WHICH MADE OUR COUNTRY GREAT AND WHICH IT WAS
FOUNDED UPON. DONALD TRUMP UNAPOLOGETICALLY
STANDS FOR THOSE VALUES.
[CHEERING] WE ARE ONE IN OUR BELIEF THAT
AMERICA MUST ADDRESS THE NATIONAL DEBT, NOT BY INCREASING
TAXES, BUT BY INCREASING OPPORTUNITIES.
[CHEERING] WE ARE ONE IN OUR BELIEF THAT WE
MUST PROTECT OUR BORDERS AND
PROMOTE FAIR TRADE THAT PUTS
AMERICAN WORKERS FIRST.
[CHEERING] AND WE ARE ONE IN OUR BELIEF
THAT WE MUST STAND WITH OUR
ALLIES LIKE ISRAEL, A BEACON OF
FREEDOM AND DEMOCRACY IN THE
MIDDLE EAST.
[CHEERING] AND WE ARE ONE IN OUR BELIEF
THAT WE MUST RESPECT OUR
MILITARY, VETERANS, AND LAW ENFORCEMENT WHO SACRIFICE KEEPS US SAFE AND FREE.
[CHEERING] AND WE ARE ONE IN OUR BELIEF THAT EVERY LIFE IS PRECIOUS REGARDLESS OF RACE AND FAITH AND
INCLUDING THE LIVES OF UNBORN
CHILDREN.
[CHEERING] AS A PARTY, WE DON'T AGREE 100% ON EVERYTHING, THAT IS OK.
WE DON'T HAVE TO. AS RONALD REAGAN ONCE SAID, THE
PERSON WHO AGREES TO DO 80% OF
-- AGREES WITH YOU 80% OF THE
TIME AS A FRIEND AND ALLY. BY EVERY AMERICAN WHO BELIEVES
IN THESE PRINCIPLES AND LONGS FOR AN END TO DIVISION AND WANTS TO MAKE AMERICA ONE AGAIN TO JOIN US IN ELECTING DONALD TRUMP AS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.
[CHEERING] THANK YOU AND MAY GOD BLESS YOU
ALL.
GOD BLESS AMERICA!

DEEPLY HUMBLED AND HONORED TO
SPEAK TO YOU AS A NATIONAL
DELEGATE FROM THE GREAT STATE OF NEW MEXICO.
[CHEERING] I AM A<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> CHRISTIAN, A WIFE, AND A
MOTHER. HAVE BEEN IN PRIVATE PRACTICE AS AN OPTOMETRIST FOR THE PAST 19 YEARS. I AM A KOREAN AMERICAN. I AM VERY PROUD TO BE A
SUPPORTER OF THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, DONALD J TRUMP.
[CHEERING] OVER 40 YEARS AGO, MY PARENTS LEFT SOUTH KOREA TO COME TO AMERICA. THEY KNEW THAT AMERICA WAS AN EXCEPTIONAL AND GENEROUS COUNTRY
WERE IMMIGRANTS COULD BECOME AMERICAN CITIZENS.
[CHEERING] PARTICIPATE IN AMERICAN DEMOCRACY AND LIVE THE AMERICAN DREAM.
[CHEERING] THEY KNEW AMERICA WAS THE LAND
OF OPPORTUNITY AND FREEDOM WHERE
IMMIGRANTS COULD SUCCEED AND
PROSPER. SO THEY SWORE AN OATH TO SUPPORT AND DEFEND THE CONSTITUTION.
[CHEERING] MY PARENTS ENDURED COUNTLESS HARDSHIPS AND MADE TREMENDOUS SACRIFICES TO PURSUE THE DREA AND THEY NEVER IMAGINED THAT ONE
DAY THEIR DAUGHTER WOULD BE
SPEAKING TO YOU TODAY. THIS IS THE BEAUTY OF THE AMERICAN DREAM.
[CHEERING] TO DO AND BE THE UNIMAGINABLE.
[CHEERING] HILLARY CLINTON IS A DIRECT THREAT TO THE AMERICAN DREAM.
[CHEERING] HER PROPOSALS WOULD BE UTTERLY
DEVASTATING TO OUR ECONOMY. HER DANGEROUS IDEOLOGY UNDERMINES OUR DEMOCRACY AND FREEDOM. SHE REPRESENTS EVERYTHING THAT
IS WRONG WITH THE SYSTEM.
[CHEERING] THE DECEIT, CORRUPTION, CRONYISM
AND A TOTAL LACK OF
ACCOUNTABILITY.
[CHEERING] WITH EXTREME CARELESSNESS SHE
HAS COMPROMISED OUR NATIONAL SECURITY AND OUR SAFETY.
[CHEERING] WITH CONTEMPT, SHE HAS FLOUTED THE RULE OF LAW THAT WE RELY ON FOR JUSTICE AND ORDER AND PEACE. SHE IS OVERWHELMINGLY LOST THE
TRUST OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. SHE IS NOT QUALIFIED TO BE OUR NEXT PRESIDENT.
SHE IS UNFIT TO BE THE
COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF OF THE BRAVE MEN AND WOMEN WHO SACRIFICED SO
MUCH TO FIGHT FOR OUR COUNTRY.
[CHEERING] THERE IS ONLY ONE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE WILL PRESERVE THE AMERICAN DREAM THAT OUR PARENTS
AND GRANDPARENTS ENVISIONED FOR
US. THERE IS ONLY ONE CANDIDATE WHO
WILL ENSURE A MORE PROSPEROUS AND SAFE AND SECURE FUTURE FOR
OUR CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN. THERE IS ONLY ONE CANDIDATE WHO WILL DEFEND THE CORE PRINCIPLES THAT THIS GREAT COUNTRY WAS
FOUNDED UPON. THERE'S ONLY ONE CANDIDATE WHO
WILL PROTECT, STAND WITH, AND FIGHT FOR WE, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.
[CHEERING] THERE IS ONLY ONE CLEAR CHOICE FOR AMERICA AND THAT CHOICES
DONALD J TRUMP.
[CHEERING] THANK YOU.

[CHEERING] IN MY WIFE SALLY, I LOVE<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> YOU.
THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING YOU DO
TO ME. I STAND BEFORE THIS CONVENTION TONIGHT AS A CHAIRMAN OF THE PARTY THAT IS CARRYING THE TORCH OF LIBERTY. WE ARE THE PARTY OF THE OPEN
DOORS. TO SOME PEOPLE, AND SOME PRESIDENTS, AMERICA IS JUST
ANOTHER COUNTRY. TWO REPUBLICANS, AMERICA IS THE
GREATEST NATION ON EARTH.
[CHEERING] WE DON'T APOLOGIZE FOR AMERICA,
WE CELEBRATE AMERICA.
NO BILL, NO BREAK.
[CHEERING] AT EVERY LEVEL, REPUBLICAN STATE
FOR ASPIRATION AND ACHIEVEMENT.
WE STAND FOR PEACE AND
PROSPERITY. WE STAND FOR FREEDOM AND
FAIRNESS. THESE VALUES HAVE INSPIRED
PEOPLE THE WORLD OVER.
EVER SINCE WE WON OUR PRISON -- FREEDOM TWO CENTURIES AGO, THESE DIETS FEEL THE SACRIFICES FOR FREEDOM AT GINSBURG AND NORMANDY
AND FALLUJA. THESE VALUES FOR THE FIGHT FOR
EQUALITY IN BIRMINGHAM ANSELMO.

IT IS CLEAR THAT THE REPUBLICAN
PARTY IS THE ONLY PARTY WILLING
TO FIGHT FOR THESE BODIES AND

21ST CENTURY.

THAT DEMOCRATS DON'T WANT YOU TO KNOW IS THAT THEY ARE THE SAME
PARTY DOING THE SAME OLD THING. NEXT WEEK, THEY'RE GOING TO TROT
OUT THE SAME OLD DEMOCRATS WITH
THE SAME OLD MESSAGE RUNNING THE SAME OLD CANDIDATE. WE ARE THE PARTY OF NEW IDEAS IN
A CHANGING AND FASTER WORLD THAN
EVER BEFORE.
[CHEERING] DEMOCRATS DEPEND ON SUPERDELEGATES AND BUREAUCRATS TO SNEAK THEIR AGENDA THROUGH
THE BACK DOOR. WE ARE THE PARTY OF THE
GRASSROOTS. WE HONOR WHAT THE VOTERS SAY. DEMOCRATS WANT TO PUT LABOR UNION BOSSES IN CHARGE OF OUR

MILLIONS OF NEW VOTERS TO OUR PARTY BECAUSE HE IS LISTENING TO

A COUNTRY WHICH HAS LOST ITS

[CHEERING] WORKING FAMILIES ARE THE
LIFEBLOOD OF OUR COUNTRY. WE CAN'T THRIVE AS A NATION UNLESS THEY ARE THRIVING.
A LOT OF HAVE NOT SEEN A BIGGER
PAYCHECK IN A VERY LONG TIME. DONALD TRUMP WAS TO MAKE SURE
YOU CAN PAY THE MORTGAGE, PUT

[CHEERING] I HAVE A MESSAGE TO AMERICA,
HOLD ON.
HELP IS COMING WITH DONALD TRUMP
AND MIKE PENCE, AMERICA IS READY
FOR A COMEBACK AFTER ALMOST A DECADE OF LINCOLN-OBAMA VALUES.
-- CLINTON-OBAMA FAILURES. I WOULD TO A CLOSE BY TELLING YOU A STORY OF AMERICAN
GREATNESS. LIAM KNUTSON WAS A DANISH
IMMIGRANT WHO STARTED OUT
WORKING IN A SHIPYARD AND LIVING
IN A BOARDING HOUSE. HE KNEW AMERICA PROMISED LIMITLESS OPPORTUNITY AND WAS
DETERMINED TO MAKE THE MOST OF
IT.
HE DEVELOPED HIS TALENTS FOR INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING AND
WORKED HIS WAY UP AT GENERAL
MOTORS. BY 1937, HE HAD BECOME THE
PRESIDENT OF THE COMPANY. IN 1940, THE GOVERNMENT ASKED
HIM TO GET AMERICA'S FACTORY -- SECTORS ON A WARTIME FOOTING.
AND SO CARS AND TRUCKS COME
AMERICA'S GREAT MANUFACTURERS WERE PROBABLY MAKING TANKS AND PLANES.
FOR THIS AND MORE OF US RESPONSIBLY -- ENORMOUS RESPONSIBLY, HE MADE ONE DOLLAR PER YEAR. HE DID NOT DO IT FOR THE MONEY, HE WAS MOTIVATED BY A DUTY TO
KEEP AMERICA FREE FROM TYRANNY. HE SET ASIDE THE JOB OF LEADING ONE OF THE LARGEST COMPANIES IN AMERICA SO HE COULD HELP SAVE THE WORLD. AT THE END OF THE WAR, THE WAR
DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL TOLD HIM YOU
HAVE NEVER DONE ANYTHING FOR YOURSELF, ONLY FOR YOUR COUNTRY.
YOU HAVE NEVER SPARED YOURSELF. LIKE WILLIAM GIBSON, WE CANNOT SPARE OURSELVES EITHER, ECONOMIC
FREEDOM BELIEVES IN THE AMERICAN
DREAM, A STRONG DEFENSE, PUTTING
COUNTRY FIRST, THOSE VALUES ARE
UNDER ASSAULT FROM HILLARY CLINTON AND THE REST OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY. LIFE, LIBERTY AND THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS IS NOT JUST A TAGLINE
FOR A BUMPER STICKER, IT IS OUR
AMERICAN LEGACY AND OUR RESPONSE ABILITY TO SAVE IT AND STRENGTHEN IT FOR OUR CHILDREN
AND GRANDCHILDREN. GOD DID NOT PUT US HERE BY ACCIDENT. THIS IS OUR MOMENT. TO SET A NEW COURSE FOR IN AMERICA AS STRONG AND CONFIDENT
AS WE HAVE EVER BEEN. LET'S STAND UNITED AS REPUBLICANS. LET'S STOP HILLARY CLINTON. LET'S GET TO WORK. EXPAND THE AMERICAN -- REPUBLICAN MAJORITY. LET'S ELECT DONALD TRUMP
RESIDENT.
[CHEERING] THANK YOU AND GOD BLESS YOU!

<p class='short_transcript'> >> GOOD EVENING.
I BUILD COMPANY SPIRIT I SUPPORT
PEOPLE BUILDING THINGS.
I'M NOT A POLITICIAN. BUT NEITHER IS DONALD TRUMP. HE IS A BUILDER AND IT IS<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> TIME TO REBUILD AMERICA.
[CHEERING] WHERE I WORK IN SILICON VALLEY,
IT IS HARD TO SEE WHERE AMERICA HAS GONE WRONG. MY INDUSTRY HAS MADE A LOT OF
PROGRESS IN COMPUTERS, SOFTWARE AND OF COURSE IT HAS MADE A LOT
OF MONEY. BUT SILICON VALLEY IS A SMALL
PLACE. DRIVE OUT TO SACRAMENTO OR EVEN
ACROSS THE BRIDGE TO OAKLAND AND YOU WILL NOT SEE THE SAME PROSPERITY. THAT IS JUST HOW SMALL IT IS. ACROSS THE COUNTRY, WAGES ARE
FLAT. AMERICANS GET PAID LESS TODAY THAN 10 YEARS AGO. BUT HEALTH CARE AND COLLEGE
TUITION COSTS MORE EVERY YEAR. MEANWHILE, WALL STREET BANKERS INFLATE BUBBLES IN EVERYTHING
FROM GOVERNMENT BONDS HILLARY CLINTON SPEAKING FEES.
[CHEERING] OUR ECONOMY IS BROKEN.
IF YOU ARE WATCHING ME RIGHT
NOW, YOU UNDERSTAND THIS AT HER
THAN ANY POLITICIAN IN
WASHINGTON DC. AND YOU KNOW THIS IS NOT THE DREAM WE LOOK FORWARD TO. BACK WHEN MY PARENTS CAME TO AMERICA LOOKING FOR THAT DREAM,
THEY FOUND IT RIGHT HERE IN
CLEVELAND.
[CHEERING] THEY BROUGHT ME HERE AS A ONE-YEAR-OLD AND THIS IS WHERE I
BECAME AN AMERICAN. OPPORTUNITY WAS EVERYWHERE. MY DATA STUDIED ENGINEERING AT
CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY. JUST DOWN THE ROAD FROM WHERE WE
ARE NOW. IN 1968, THE WORLD HIGH-TECH
CAPITAL WAS NOT JUST ONE CITY,
ALL OF AMERICA WAS HIGH-TECH. IT IS HARD TO REMEMBER THIS, BUT
OUR GOVERNMENT WAS ONCE HIGH-TECH TOO.WHEN I MOVED IT CLEVELAND, DEFENSE RESEARCH WAS
LAYING THE FOUNDATIONS FOR THE
INTERNET. THE APOLLO PROGRAM WAS JUST ABOUT TO PUT A MAN ON THE MOON. AND IT WAS THE ARMSTRONG FROM
RIGHT HERE IN OHIO -- NEIL ARMSTRONG FROM RIGHT HERE IN
OHIO. TODAY OUR GOVERNMENT IS BROKEN. OUR NUCLEAR BASES STILL USE
FLOPPY DISKS.
OUR NEWEST FIGHTER JET CAN'T EVEN FLY IN THE RING.
-- RAIN AND IT WOULD BE. KINDEST IN THE GOVERNMENT SOFTWARE WORKS POORLY BECAUSE
MUCH OF THE TIME IT DOES NOT
EVEN WORK AT ALL. THAT IS A STAGGERING DECLINE FOR
THE COUNTRY THAT COMPLETED THE MANHATTAN PROJECT.
WE DON'T ACCEPT SUCH
INCOMPETENCE IN SILICON VALLEY
AND WE MUST NOT ACCEPT IT FROM
OUR GOVERNMENT.
[CHEERING] INSTEAD OF GOING TO MARS, WE
HAVE INVADED THE MIDDLE EAST. WE DON'T NEED TO SEE HELLER CLINTON DELETED E-MAILS, HER COMPETENCE IS IN PLAIN SIGHT.
-- INCOMPETENCE IS IN PLAIN
SIGHT.
[CHEERING] SHE PUSHED FOR A WAR IN LIBYA AND TODAY IT IS A TRAINING GROUND FOR ISIS. ON THIS MOST IMPORTANT ISSUE,
DONALD TRUMP IS RIGHT. IT IS TIME TO END THE ERA OF
STUPID WARS AND REBUILD OUR COUNTRY.
[CHEERING] WHEN I WAS A KID, THE GREAT
DEBATE WAS ABOUT HOW TO DEFEAT
THE SOVIET UNION.
AND WE WON. NOW WE ARE TOLD THAT THE GREAT
DEBATE IS ABOUT WHO GETS TO USE
WHICH BATHROOM. THIS IS A DISTRACTION FROM OUR
REAL PROBLEMS. WHO CARES?
[CHEERING] OF COURSE, EVERY AMERICAN HAS A
UNIQUE IDENTITY.
I AM PROUD TO BE GAY. I'M PROUD TO BE A REPUBLICAN.
[CHEERING] MOST OF ALL, I'M PROUD TO BE AN AMERICAN.
[CHEERING] I DON'T PRETEND TO AGREE WITH
EVERY PLANK IN OUR PARTY PLATFORM, BUT STATE CULTURE WARS ONLY DISTRACT US FROM OUR
ECONOMIC DECLINE. NOBODY IN THIS RACE IS BEING HONEST ABOUT IT EXCEPT DONALD TRUMP.
[CHEERING] WHILE IT IS FITTING TO TALK ABOUT WHO WE ARE, TODAY IT IS
MORE IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER WHERE
WE CAME FROM.
FOR ME THAT IT'S CLEVELAND. THE BRIGHT FUTURE AS PROMISED. WHEN DONALD TRUMP ASKS US TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, HE IS
NOT SUGGESTING A RETURN TO THE
PAST. HE IS RUNNING TO LEAD US BACK TO
THE BRIGHT FUTURE. TONIGHT, I URGE ALL OF MY FELLOW
AMERICANS TO STAND UP AND VOTE
FOR DONALD TRUMP.

THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IN LIFE
IS TO LOVE WHAT YOU ARE DOING BECAUSE THAT IS THE ONLY WAY HE WILL EVER BE GOOD AT IT.<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> MY GRANDFATHER WAS FIERCELY
AMBITIOUS. A WORKAHOLIC.
HE MADE MY FATHER AND HIS SIBLINGS WATCH HIM AS HE WORKED CONSTRUCTION SITES.
THAT IS HOW WE TALK TO HIM. MY FATHER CARRIED A PASSION FOR LEARNING TO THE WHARTON SCHOOL
OF FINANCE. WHEN HE GRADUATED, HE SET HIS SIGHTS ON MANHATTAN.
MY GRANDFATHER CANNOT UNDERSTAND
WHY. HE HAD BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN
BROOKLYN AND QUEENS AND THOUGHT
MY FATHER SHOULD FOLLOW IN HIS
FOOTSTEPS.
TO MY FATHER, MANHATTAN WAS THE
EPICENTER OF THE WORLD.
IT WAS CENTER STAGE. IT WAS WHERE HE WANTED TO MAKE
HIS NAME. WHEN I FATHER FIRST LAID EYES ON
THE COMMODORE HOTEL IN THE HEART
OF NEW YORK CITY, AT 42ND STREET
NEXT TO GRAND CENTRAL STATION, HE KNEW THE RUNDOWN PROPERTY HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO BE A CROWN JEWEL. THE TURNING POINT CAME WHEN MY
FATHER DECIDED TO PURCHASE THE
GREATEST SINGLE PIECE OF REAL
ESTATE IN HER CITY. WORKING FROM HIS APARTMENT EVERY
DAY, HE WOULD PASS AN 11 STORY
BUILDING AT THE CORNER OF 57 STREET AND -- IT WOULD TO BECOME THE ICONIC TRUMP TOWER. TIMING IS EVERYTHING. IN 1982, HE UNVEILED THE $209 58
STORY APARTMENT RETAIL TOPICS. IT WAS THE CORNERSTONE OF MY
FATHER'S GLOBAL AND -- PLAN. TRUMP INTERNATIONAL HOTEL AND TOWER, TRUMP SOHO, MARA LAGO, THE POST OFFICE, MY FATHER HAS
BOTH AN ACQUIRED PROPERTIES ALL
OVER THE WORLD.
SCOTLAND, DUBAI, CANADA, PENAMA,
BRAZIL.
EVERYTHING MY BROTHER DOES -- FATHER DOES IS FIRST CLASS. HE LOVES BUILDING THE GREATEST
PROJECTS IN THE WORLD.
AND YOU LOVE WHAT YOU DO, YOU
APPARENTLY DO IT BETTER. IT DOES NOT FEEL LIKE WORK. HIS PASSION IS CONTAGIOUS AND IT
MOTIVATES PEOPLE AROUND HIM.
WHEN MY FATHER'S PROUDEST ACCOMPLISHMENTS WITH THEM A
GRANDFATHER LIVED TO WITNESS THE
ROOT OF HIS SUCCESS.
HE LIVED TO SEE OUR NAME
TRANSFORMED. SINCE THEN, NOT A DAY GOES BY
THAT MY FATHER DOES NOT WISH MY
GRANDFATHER WAS HERE TO SEE THE BRAND RISE TO GLOBAL EXCELLENCE.
DOMINATED THE WORLD OF LUXURY
HOTELS. OMITTING THE WORLD OF GOLF AND
NOW, THE WORLD OF POLITICS. MY GRANDFATHER WAS A PATRIOTIC AMERICAN. I KNOW HE WOULD GET A KICK OUT
OF SEEING HIS SON EXCEPT THE
REPUBLICAN NOMINATION FOR
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. NOT PEOPLE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK ALONGSIDE THEIR CHILDREN.
BUT MY FATHER HAS BEEN BLESSED
TO NOT ONLY FOR US, BUT TO ALSO TEACH US WHAT MY GRANDFATHER HAD
TAUGHT HIM. AND NOW, AS HE TAKES THE
GREATEST UP IN HIS LIFE, ALL
THAT HE HAS WORKED FOR SO HARD WILL BE IN VERY CAPABLE HANDS
WITH US. MY FATHER STRUCK A NERVE WITH
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. PEOPLE WHO NEVER CARED ABOUT THE ELECTION OR VOTED BEFORE, RUSHING TO HIS RALLIES, SUCCESS
HAS TAUGHT MY FATHER THAT ANYTHING IS POSSIBLE. EVEN WHERE OTHERS HAVE FAILED, HIS VISION CAN PROSPER. AMERICA HAS BEEN MY FATHER EVERYTHING COMING KERNEL FAMILY,
SUCCESSFUL COMPANY, AND THE
ABILITY TO EMPLOY THOUSANDS OF
HARD-WORKING PEOPLE EVERY DAY. AS PRESIDENT, MY FATHER PAYS TO
KEEP MAKING DEALS COME UP DEALS
ON BEHALF OF THIS COUNTRY.
AROUND THE CLOCK.
IT IS TIME FOR MY FATHER TO USE ALL THAT LIFE HAS TAUGHT HIM TO
BRING OUR COUNTRY ACT -- BACK.

<strong>TOM</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> TOM: THIS IS A WOW. 
I FEEL LIKE THE ANCHOVY ON IVNAK A'S CESAR SALAD. I KNOW YOU'RE SALIVATING. BEFORE I START, I HAVE TO TELL YOU A FUNNY STORY.
FOR<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> SURE I WAS A LITTLE BIT NERVOUS.
I HAVE A GREAT UNCLE IN BEIRUT WHO IS AN UNBELIEVABLE INTERNATIONAL LAWYER AND ORA TORTOR. 
YOU'VE GOT TO HELP -- ORATOR. I SAID YOU'VE GOT TO HELP ME. I'M A LITTLE BIT NERVOUS. SO CAN YOU GIVE ME SOME ADVICE. HE SAID, WHY WOULD THEY HAVE YOU?
[LAUGHTER] I SAID THAT'S NOT EXACTLY WHAT I NEED. 
I NEED TO BE PUMPED UP. I'M NERVOUS. I NEED SOME CONFIDENCE. DON'T DO THIS TO ME. OK. OK. 
GIVE ME TWO MINUTES, LET ME THINK.
I'VE GOT IT.
I'VE GOT IT.
YOU'RE JUST LIKE A DECEASED AT  
AN IRISH WAKE.
I SAID YOU MEAN, I'M THAT GOOD? HE SAID NO, YOU NEED TO GET THINGS STARTED BUT NOBODY 
EXPECTS YOU TO SAY VERY MUCH. 
SO WITH THAT, I WANT TO START.
AND I'M HERE BECAUSE DONALD 
TRUMP IS ONE OF MY CLOSEST  
FRIENDS FOR 40 YEARS. 
AND I'M THE SON OF A VERY HUMBLE LEBANESE GROCER FROM CULVER CITY, CALIFORNIA. 
WHERE'S CALIFORNIA? 
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] 
YES. AND I'M HERE BECAUSE OF THE AMAZING MAGIC ELIXER THAT 
HAPPENED BETWEEN THE D.N.A. OF A
THOUSAND CIVILIZATION FROM THE  
LAVAT AND THE BEAUTY TAPPED 
WONDER AND THE OPPORTUNITY OF AMERICA THAT PUTS ALL OF US HERE IN THIS RAP CHURE OF THE  
AMERICAN DREAM FOR ME TO BE HERE TONIGHT TO TALK ABOUT MY FRIEND, MY PARTNER AND THE FUTURE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, DONALD TRUMP. 
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] SO WHAT I'M GOING TO DO IS  
SOMETHING DIFFERENT.
YOU'RE GOING TO HATE ME FOR IT BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT GOING TO HEAR ONE NEGATIVE THING OUT OF MY  
MOUTH. I HAVE NOTHING NEGATIVE THING TO
SAY ABOUT HILLARY.
I HAVE ONLY AMAZING THINGS TO 
TELL YOU ABOUT DONALD.
[APPLAUSE]
BECAUSE THIS MAN IS GOOD ENOUGH.
HE'S TOUGH ENOUGH.
HE'S SMART ENOUGH AND HE'S WELL VERSED ENOUGH TO DO IT ON HIS OWN MERITS. 
WE DON'T NEED TO GO ANY PLACE ELSE. 
SO WHAT I WANT TO DO IS SPEND A 
LITTLE TIME TALKING TO YOU ABOUT THE MESSENGER, THE MAN. WITHOUT HIS ARMOR, WITHOUT HIS  
WEAPONRY, WALKING DOWN THE TUNNEL INTO THE ARENA, WHO IS 
HE? 
WHAT IS HE MADE OUT OF? 
SO IF WE START AN EASY PLACE TO 
FIND HIM IS IN HIS CHILDREN.
AND YOU'VE ALL HAD THE GREAT  
OPPORTUNITY TO SEE HIS KIDS OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS.
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT?
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] 
AND THE LITMUS TEST IS IN THE 
CHILDREN. MY MOTHER USED TO SAY, YOU LEARN
HOW TO BE A MAN BY WATCHING YOUR FATHER. 
YOU WATCH THIS MAN, YOU GET IT. 
THOSE OF US WHO ARE MARRIED OR HAVE A PARTNER UNDERSTAND THAT  
THE BEST REFLECTIONS OF US IS OUR WIVES.
IN MY CASE FOR SURE, IT'S 
ROCHELLE. AND IN DONALD'S CASE IS MELANIA. AND MELANIA, I WANT TO TELL YOU 
ON BEHALF OF THE 10,000 PEOPLE  
AND THE 50 MILLION PEOPLE WHO 
ARE WATCHING YOU ARE A TIMELESS 
TRIBUTE TO BEAUTY, GRACE AND  
ELEGANCE UNDER PRESSURE. YOU'RE AMAZING. YOU'RE AWESOME. SO I'M GOING TO USE WORDS THAT  
YOU PROBABLY HAVEN'T HEARD ABOUT
DONALD. I STARTED MY RELATIONSHIP WITH  
HIM IN A FUNNY WAY. I HAD THE FORTUNE OF WORKING FOR A MAN NAMED BOB BASS IN FORT  
WORTH, TEXAS. 
IN THE 1980'S WE BOUGHT A HOTEL 
COMPANY AND THE HOTEL COMPANY HAPPENED TO OWN THE HOTEL THAT  
WAS RIGHT BEHIND DONALD'S WINDOW IN HIS OFFICE. SO YOU KNOW DONALD WELL ENOUGH BY NOW TO KNOW THAT HE NEEDED THAT HOTEL. AND I WAS A YOUNG PUP. HE WAS A BIG GUY IN NEW YORK. HE WANTED TO BUY THE HOTEL. LONG STORY SHORT WE ENDED UP  
HAVING 30 LAWYERS, 50 ACCOUNTANTS.
I'M SCARED TO DEATH BECAUSE MY  
BOSS WAS GOING TO FIND OUT THAT I WAS SELLING TO TRUMP WHO WOULD
END UP GETTING A MUCH BETTER DEAL. 
THIS IS WHAT STARTED MY FRIENDSHIP. 
DID SOMETHING I HAD NEVER SEEN  
BEFORE AND THAT I HAVE USED CONSECUTIVELY AFTER THAT. 
HE SAID, LOOK, I WANT TO DO 
THIS. I DON'T KNOW WHAT I SHOULD KNOW.
SO I WILL PAY YOUR BOSS THE PRICE THAT HE WANTS AND I'LL  
CLOSE IT IN ONE WEEK ON ONE CONDITION. YOU, TOM BARRICK, TELL ME 
EVERYTHING THAT I SHOULD KNOW 
THAT I DON'T KNOW.
LOOK, I JUST TOLD YOU, I DON'T KNOW THAT. NO CONTRACT.
YOU AND I SHAKE HANDS RIGHT 
HERE. NO LAWYERS, NO CONTRACT.
YOU JUST TELL ME THE THINGS THAT
I SHOULD KNOW AND HOW TO FIX IT.
AND I'LL DO THIS DEAL.
HE PLAYED ME LINE A STEINWAY PIANO.
I FIXED EVERYTHING IN THE HOTEL.
A WOMAN, 83 YEARS OLD.
HE HAD ME BUY HER A PIANO, DO THE CARPET. 
IT WAS ONE OF THE MOST AMAZING  
THINGS I HAD EVER SEEN. 
HE WAS INCREDIBLE.
BUT HE PRACTICES AN UNBELIEVABLE SET OF DISCIPLINES. 
SO EVERYBODY SAYS, OK, THE MAN IS RICH.
HE'S A CELEBRITY. HE'S POWERFUL.
BUT WHAT IS HE GOING TO DO? 
HOW DOES HE DO IT?
AND HE HAS RELENTLESS HABITS, 
RELENTLESS BEAUTIFUL HABITS. HE SHOWS UP ON TIME. HE BELIEVES THAT PUNKS WALLITY  
IS THE COURTESY OF KINGS. HE DOESN'T CONFUSE EFFORTS WITH RESULTS.
HE BEFRIENDS THE BEWILDERED.
HE PUSHES EVERYBODY AROUND HIM  
INCLUDING YOU THROUGH COMFORT 
BARRIERS THAT THEY NEVER THOUGHT THAT THEY COULD EVER, EVER  
SHATTER. AND HE DOES ALL THIS WITH THE DISCIPLINE OF -- OF AN ANIMAL IN THE JUNGLE. HIS MOTTO IS THAT A LION WAKES UP EVERY MORNING AND KNOWS ONE THING THAT IT HAS RUN FASTER THAN THE FASTEST GAZELLE AND A GAZELLE WAKES UP AND SHE KNOWS  
THAT SHE NEEDS TO RUN FASTER THAN THE FASTEST LION. WHETHER YOU'RE A GAZELLE OR A LION, YOU GET THE HELL GOING. AND THAT IS -- THAT IS DONALD. BUT I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU TWO LITTLE VIGNETTES THAT REALLY  
STUCK IN MY MIND. IT'S NOT FINANCIAL. IT'S NOT HOW RICH HE IS. IT'S NOT HOW A GOOD DEAL GUY HE 
IS. 
I'M TELLING YOU, AFTER 35 YEARS 
BEING WITH A MAN THROUGH THE  
VALLEYS AND UP THE MOUNTAINS, HE
REALLY IS BETTER THAN THE BUILDING YOU SEE, JUST AS AN ADMINISTRATOR, AS AN EXECUTIVE, 
AS A GUY WHO CAN ACTUALLY TAKE  
CARE OF THE PEOPLE THAT WORK ON 
HIM AND BUILD TEAMS.
BUT IT WAS 1989.
I KNOW MANY OF YOU ESPECIALLY 
YOU GIRLS WERE NOT ALIVE THEN.
AND IT WAS A TYSON FIGHT. AND THIS TIME DONALD WAS BIG IN 
ATLANTIC CITY.
HE CALLED ME UP.
HE SAID LET'S GO TO THE TYSON 
FIGHT.
I SAID I HAVE ONE OF THE LITTLE 
SONS WITH ME. 
HE SAID, NO PROBLEM.
I'LL BRING DONNIE IN TYPICAL  
TRUMP STYLE WE JUMP ON THE TRUMP
HELICOPTER. WE FLY INTO ATLANTIC CITY AND 
IT'S A ZOO. THOUSANDS OF PAPARAZZI, 
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE EVERYWHERE. 
WHISK TO HIS LIMB OVEMENT GO TO THE FRONT OF THE CONVENTION CENTER AND THERE'S 10,000 CAMERAS.
HE SAID LET'S GO TO THE BACK OF 
THE CONVENTION CENTER.
WE GO TO THE BACK OF THE  
CONVENTION CENTER.
WE START WALKING IN AND PEOPLE  
ARE HARASSING HIM LIKE MAD. THE SIDE OF THE DOOR THERE'S A LITTLE NONDISSCRIPT MAN. HE SAID MR. TRUMP, MR. TRUMP. 
DONALD STOPS. 
HE WALKS OVER TO THE DOOR.
HE SAID LOUIE. HE SAID MR. TRUMP, THANK YOU FOR WHAT YOU'VE DONE TO MY EMPLOYEES AND FOR ME. I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT MY  
CRITICAL ILL SON THINKS YOU'RE THE BEST IN WORLD.
MEANWHILE EVERYTHING IS GOING ON. 
AND DONALD IS FOCUSED EYE TO EYE
WITH THIS MAN WHO AT THAT MOMENT
THOUGHT HE WAS THE ONLY STAR IN DONALD'S UNIVERSE. HE SAID LOUIE, I'M NOT THE  
GREATEST MAN IN THE WORLD.
YOU ARE. WE TAKE THE KIDS. 
WE ROLL IN. 
IT'S FIVE MINUTES TO THE FIGHT. 
I THINK IT WAS TYSON-HOLMES. ONE OF TYSON'S LONGEST FIGHTS.
WE GET TO THE FLOOR AND HE'S FIDGETTY. 
I'VE GOT THE BOYS. I SAID WHAT'S WRONG? GIVE ME YOUR PROGRAM. I GAVE HIM THE PROGRAM. HE WRITES SOMETHING ON IT.
HE BRINGS ONE OF THE SECURITY GUARDS OVER AND SENDS IT BACK TO
THE DOORMAN. I SAID WHAT WAS THAT? HE SAID I JUST WROTE A NOTE.</span><span class='hidden-full-transcript-ellipses'>...</span></p><a href='#' class='hidden-full-transcript-link'><i class='icon-chevron-down'></i> <span class='link-show-full-text'>Show Full Text</span><i class='icon-chevron-up'></i> <span class='link-show-less-text'>Show Less Text</span></a>

<p class='short_transcript'> >> I SAID WHAT DID THE NOTE SAY. IT WAS TO HIS SON AND SAID I  
CAME HERE TONIGHT TO SEE TWO CHAMPIONS, MIKE TYSON AND YOUR DAD. TRUE STORY. 
[APPLAUSE]<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> NOW, WHAT KIND OF MAN IN THE MIDDLE OF HIS CELEBRITYSHIP HAS 
THE PRESENCE TO FOCUS ON THE LITTLEST GUY IN THE SHOP? AND THAT IS DONALD TRUMP. 
10 YEARS LATER -- 
[APPLAUSE] 10 YEARS LATER, ONE OF THE GREATEST MEN IN DONALD'S LIFE 
PASSED AWAY, FRED TRUMP.
AND THE FUNERAL WAS BEING HELD  
THE NIGHT BEFORE AT THE FRANK 
CAMPBELL FUNERAL HALL, 82ND AND MADISON.
DONALD SAID, I CAN'T STAND IT.
I'M GOING TO GO OVER EARLY. 
WHILE DON'T YOU GO OVER EARLY 
WITH ME.
I SAID FINE.
WE'RE SITTING AS KIND OF, YOU KNOW, TWO MIDDLE AGED GUYS THAT 
GO THROUGH THAT DEBATE WHEN YOUR
FATHER LEAVES. WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN RELEVANCY AND MORTALITY?
RIGHT? THAT LOSS WHERE YOU'RE  
QUESTIONING WHAT'S IMPORTANT AND WHAT'S NOT IMPORTANT AND IT'S NOT ABOUT MONEY AND IT'S NOT  
ABOUT POWER AND IT'S NOT ABOUT  
STUFF.
AND ALL OF THE AGONY THAT YOU 
HAVE WITH YOUR FATHER AT THAT INSTANT JUST EVAPORATES AND 
YOU'RE SITTING THERE WITH SOMETHING. SO HE SAT THERE MUSING. 
I SAID HOW DO YOU FEEL. 
HE SAID, I'M THANKFUL THAT I HAVE MY MOM'S STRENGTH AND MY MOM'S SENSITIVITY.
AND ALL I WANT TO DO IS LEAVE 
THE LEGACY OF THE TRUMP NAME  
THAT THEY BUILT A LITTLE BIT  
BETTER THAN I FOUND IT. HE'S DONE IT. 
[APPLAUSE] SO LOOK.
WE'RE AT A TIPPING POINT. 
THE WORLD IS IN MASS JUST 
NECKLESS OF GLOBALISM THAT WE TALKED ABOUT HAS CRUMBLED AND SHATTER INTO A THOUSAND CHARDS. 
IT NEEDS A JEWELER TO TAKE EACH OF THOSE JEWELS ONE BY ONE STARTING AMERICA, ITS OWN DIAMOND AND POLISH IT. THEN SLOWLY FIND SEAMLESS 
STRENGTH AND PEW THEM ALL BACK  
TOGETHER. SO WHAT WE LOOK AT IS THE NECKLACE OF PROSPERITY AND  
TOLERANCE AARON THE WORLD.
-- AROUND THE WORLD.
WE'VE BEEN ON AN ADVENTURE AND  
PEOPLE SAY, WOW, DONALD TRUMP,  
IT'S LIKE A MISHNER TAIL FROM 
BUSINESSMAN, TO CELEBRITY, TO FATHER TO POTENTIALLY PRESIDENT 
OF THE UNITED STATES, AND I SAY 
TO YOU, IT IS A TALE. BUT IT IS A TAIL. IT'S TO MAKE ONCE UPON A TIME,  
ONCE UPON THIS TIME.
THANK YOU.

<p class='short_transcript'> >> HELLO, I'M JOHN VOIGGET. 
I WANT -- VOIGHT. 
I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU MY 
FRIEND DONALD TRUMP.
HE'S RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT OF 
THE UNITED STATES. AS<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> YOU KNOW, WHEN HE GETS 
ELECTED HE WILL MAKE OUR COUNTRY
GREAT AGAIN.
THE STORY BEGINS IN NEW YORK IN 
THE EARLY 1970'S. 
THE CITY WAS ON THE VERGE OF  
BANKRUPTCY BUT DONALD LOOKED  
ACROSS THE RIVER AND SAW NOT A TROUBLED CITY BUT A CITY THAT 
SYMBOLIZED AMERICA'S GREATNESS  
AND HE WAS COMMITTED TO MAKING  
IT GREAT AGAIN. DONALD WAS BORN IN QUEENS TO FRED AND MARYANNE TRUMP. HIS FATHER WAS A BUILDER AND WAS
THE GREATEST INFLUENCE IN YOUNG DONALD'S LIFE.
HE LEARNED ABOUT LEADERSHIP EARLY AT THE NEW YORK MILITARY ACADEMY.
HE BECAME CAPTAIN OF THE  
BASEBALL TEAM AND CAPTAIN OF THE CADETS. HE LEARNED THAT BUILDING BUSINESS AT HIS FATHER'S SIDE 
WHILE WORKING ON HIS DEGREE AT THE WARTON SCHOOL OF FINANCE. 
AFTER COLLEGE, DONALD FACED A DECISION, JOIN HIS FATHER IN  
QUEENS OR DREAM BIG AND MAKE IT IN THE GREATEST CITY IN THE WORLD?
THE DECISION WAS EASY. DONALD'S FIRST NOTABLE PROJECT  
WAS LESS ABOUT RENOVATING A 
BUILDING THAN HELPING THE CITY REDISCOVER ITS SOUL.
THE ONCE GREAT COME DOOR HOTEL  
LANGUISHED IN A HOTEL NEXT TO 
GRAND CENTRAL STATION.
THE HOTEL WAS SOLD TO THE ONE 
DEVELOPER WHO SHOWED HE HAD THE 
KIND OF DRIVE, BACKING AND  
IMAGINATION THAT WOULD BE NECESSARY. THEY CHOSE DONALD TRUMP.
DONALD CONVINCED THE BANKS THAT THEY HAD A MORAL OBLIGATION TO  
INVEST IN NEW YORK AND NEGOTIATE
A TAX ABATEMENT WITH THE CITY,  
JUMP STARTING A PROJECT AND 
CREATING NEW CONSTRUCTION IN HOTEL JOBS. DONALD'S STRIKING NEW BUILDING  
REVITALIZED THE NEIGHBORHOOD.</span><span class='hidden-full-transcript-ellipses'>...</span></p><a href='#' class='hidden-full-transcript-link'><i class='icon-chevron-down'></i> <span class='link-show-full-text'>Show Full Text</span><i class='icon-chevron-up'></i> <span class='link-show-less-text'>Show Less Text</span></a>

<p class='short_transcript'> >> GOOD EVENING.
[CHEERING] THANK YOU. ONE YEAR AGO I ENTERED IS MY FATHER WHEN HE DECLARED HIS
CANDIDACY. IN HIS OWN WAY ANSWER HIS OWN SHEER FORCE OF<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> WILL, HE SACRIFICED GREATLY TO ENTER THE POLITICAL ARENA AS AN OUTSIDER.
AND HE PREVAILED AGAINST A FIELD OF 16 VERY TALENTED COMPETITORS.
[CHEERING] FOR MORE THAN A YEAR, DONALD
TRUMP HAS BEEN THE PEOPLE'S
CHAMPION. AND TONIGHT, HE IS THE PEOPLE'S
NOMINEE.
[CHEERING] LIKE MANY OF MY FELLOW
MILLENNIALS, I DO NOT CONSIDER MYSELF CATEGORICALLY REPUBLICAN
OR DEMOCRAT. MORE THAN PARTY, I VOTE BASED ON
WHAT I BELIEVE IS RIGHT FOR MY
FAMILY AND MY COUNTRY. SOMETIMES IT IS A TOUGH CHOICE. THAT IS NOT THE CASE THIS TIME. A PROUD DAUGHTER OF YOUR
NOMINEE, I'M HERE TO TELL YOU
THAT THIS IS A MOMENT AND DONALD
TRUMP IS THE PERSON TO MAKE
AMERICA GREAT AGAIN.
[CHEERING] REAL CHANGE, THE KINDLY IN A DECADES IS ONLY GOING TO COME FROM OUTSIDE THE SYSTEM AND IT
IS ONLY GOING TO COME FROM A MAN
WHO IS SPENT HIS ENTIRE LIFE
DOING WHAT OTHERS SAID CANNOT BE DONE. MY FATHER IS A FIGHTER. WHEN THE PRIMARIES GOT TOUGH,
AND THEY WERE TOP, HE DID WHAT ANY GREAT LEADER DOES, HE DUG DEEPER, WORKED HARDER, GOT BETTER AND BECAME STRONGER.
[CHEERING] I HAVE SEEN HIM FIGHT FOR HIS
FAMILY. I HAVE SEEN HIM FIGHT FOR HIS
EMPLOYEES. I HAVE SEEN HIM FIGHT FOR HIS COMPANY AND NOW I AM SEEING HIM
FIGHT FOR OUR COUNTRY.
[CHEERING] IT IS THE STORY OF HIS LIFE AND
MORE RECENTLY, THE SPIRIT OF HIS
CAMPAIGN.
IT IS ALSO A PRELUDE TO REACHING
THE GOAL THAT UNITES US ALL. WHEN -- THIS PARTY AND BETTER
STILL THIS COUNTRY KNOWS WHAT IT
IS LIKE TO WIN AGAIN.
[CHEERING] POSSIBLE TO BE FAMOUS AND NOT WELL KNOWN, THAT DESCRIBES THE
FATHER WHO RAISED ME. IN THE SAME OFFICE OF TRUCK TIRE WHERE WE -- TRUMP TOWER WHERE WE
WORK TOGETHER, REPLAY AND ON THE
FOR NEXT MY FATHER'S DESK CONSTRUCTING MINIATURE BUILDINGS WITH LEGOS WHILE HE DID THE SAME WITH CONCRETE, STEEL AND GLASS. MY FATHER TAUGHT MY SIBLINGS AND ME THE IMPORTANCE OF POSITIVE
VALUES IN A STRONG ETHICAL
COMPASS. HE SHOWED US HOW TO BE
RESILIENT, HOW TO DEAL WITH CHALLENGES AND HOW TO STRIVE FOR
EXCELLENCE IN ALL THAT WE DO.
HE TAUGHT US THAT THERE IS
NOTHING WE CANNOT ACCOMPLISH IF
WE MARRIED VISION AND PASSION
WITH AN ENDURING WORK ETHIC.
[CHEERING] ONE OF MY FATHER'S GREATEST
TALENTS IS HIS ABILITY TO SEE POTENTIAL IN PEOPLE BEFORE THEY SEATED HIMSELF -- THEMSELVES.
HE TAUGHT US THAT POTENTIAL
MANAGERS INTO NOTHING WITHOUT
EFFORT. AND THAT LIKE HIM, WE EACH HAD A RESPONSIBILITY TO WORK NOT JUST
FOR OURSELVES, BUT FOR THE BETTERMENT OF THE WORLD AROUND US.
[CHEERING] OVER THE YEARS, ON TOO MANY
OCCASIONS TO COME, I SAW MY FATHER CARE STORIES OUT OF THE
NEWSPAPER ABOUT PEOPLE AND HE HAD NEVER MET WERE FACING INJUSTICE OR HARDSHIP. WROTE A NOTE TO HIS ASSISTANT
AND A SIGNATURE PEN AND
REQUESTED THAT THE PERSON BE FOUND AND INVITED TO COME POWER TO MEET WITH HIM.
HE WOULD TALK TO THEM AND DRAW A POUND -- UPON HIS EXTENSIVE NETWORKING ON THEM A JOB OR GET A BREAK.
THEY WOULD LEAVE HIS OFFICE AS
PEOPLE SO OFTEN DO AFTER HAVING BEEN WITH DONALD TRUMP FEELING THAT LIFE COULD BE GREAT AGAIN. THROUGHOUT MY ENTIRE LIFE, EYEWITNESSES EMPATHY AND
GENEROSITY TOWARDS OTHER,
ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO ARE
SUFFERING.
IT IS JUST HIS WAY OF BEING IN
YOUR CORNER WHEN YOU ARE DOWN. MY FATHER NOT ONLY HAS THE STRENGTH AND ABILITY NECESSARY TO BE THE NEXT PRESIDENT, BUT ALSO THE KINDNESS AND COMPASSION THAT WILL ENABLE HIM TO BE THE
LEADER THAT THIS COUNTRY NEEDS.
[CHEERING] MY FATHER HAS A SENSE OF FAIRNESS THAT TOUCHES EVERY CONVICTION HE HOLDS.
I WORKED ALONGSIDE HIM FOR MORE
THAN A DECADE NOW AT THE TRUMP
ORGANIZATION I HAVE SEEN HOW HE
OPERATES AS A LEADER MAKING IMPORTANT DECISIONS THAT SHAPE CAREERS AND CHANGE LIVES. I HAVE LEARNED A LOT ABOUT THE
WORLD FROM WALKING CONSTRUCTION JOBS DOWN BY HIS SIDE. WHEN RUN PROPERLY, CONSTRUCTION SITES ARE TRUE MERITOCRACY. COMPETENCE IN THE BUILDING TRADE
IS EASY TO SPOT AND INCOMPETENCE IS IMPOSSIBLE TO HIDE.
[CHEERING] THESE SITES ARE ALSO INCREDIBLE MELTING POTS GATHERING PEOPLE
FROM ALL WALKS OF LIFE AND UNITING THEM TO WORK TOWARDS A
SINGLE MISSION. THERE HAVE ALWAYS BEEN MEN OF
ALL BACKGROUNDS AND ETHNICITIES ON MY FATHER'S JOB SITES AND LONG BEFORE IT WAS COMMONPLACE HE ALSO SAW WOMEN.
[CHEERING] MY FATHER VALUES TALENT.
HE RECOGNIZES REAL KNOWLEDGE AND
SKILL WHEN HE FINDS IT.
HE IS COLORBLIND AND GENDER-NEUTRAL.
[CHEERING] HE HAS THE BEST PERSON FOR THE JOB.
. WORDS AND PROMISES, THE MATTER
HOW VISIONARY THEY SOUND WILL
ONLY GET YOU SO FAR. IN OUR VISION, YOU ARE NOT A BUILDER UNLESS YOU HAVE A
BUILDING TO SHOW FOR IT.
OR IN MY FATHER'S CASE, CITY SKYLINE'S.
[CHEERING] MOST PEOPLE STRIVE THEIR ENTIRE
LIVES TO ACHIEVE GREAT SUCCESS
IN A SINGLE INDUSTRY. MY FATHER HAS SUCCEEDED IN MANY
ON THE HIGHEST LEVEL AND ON A GLOBAL SCALE. ONE OF THE REASONS HE STRIVES AS AN ENTREPRENEUR IS BECAUSE HE LISTENS TO EVERYONE. BILLIONAIRE EXECUTIVES DON'T
USUALLY ASK THE PEOPLE DOING THE
WORK FOR THEIR OPINIONS OF THE
WORK. MY FATHER IS AN EXCEPTION. ON EVERY ONE OF HIS PROJECTS YOU
WILL SEE HIM TALKING TO THE
SUPER, THE PAINTER, THE ELECTRICIAN, HE WILL ASK THEM
FOR THEIR FEEDBACK. IF THEY THINK SOMETHING SHOULD BE DONE DIFFERENTLY OR COULD BE DONE BETTER.
ONE DONALD TRUMP IS IN CHARGE HIM ALL THAT COUNTS HIS ABILITY, EFFORT AND EXCELLENCE.
[CHEERING] THIS HAS LONG BEEN THE PHILOSOPHY OF THE TRUMP
ORGANIZATION. MY FATHER'S COMPANY, THERE ARE
MORE FEMALE THAN MALE EXECUTIVES. WOMEN ARE PAID EQUALLY FOR THE
WORK THAT WE DO AND WHEN A WOMAN
BECOMES A MOTHER SHE IS SUPPORTED, NOT SHUT OUT.
[CHEERING] WOMEN REPRESENT 46% OF THE TOTAL U.S. LABOR FORCE AND 40% OF
AMERICAN HOUSEHOLDS HAVE FEMALE
PRIMARY BREADWINNERS. IN 2014, WOMEN MADE $.83 FOR
EVERY DOLLAR EARNED BY A MAN. SINGLE WOMEN WITHOUT CHILDREN EARNED $.94 WHEREAS MARRIED MOTHERS MADE ONLY $.77. AS RESEARCHERS HAVE NOTED,
GENDER IS NO LONGER A FACTOR CREATING THE GREATEST WAGE DISCREPANCY, MOTHERHOOD IS. AS PRESIDENT, MY FATHER WILL CHANGE THE LABOR LAWS THAT WERE PUT IN PLACE AT A TIME WHEN
WOMEN WERE UP A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE WORKFORCE. HE WILL FOCUS ON MAKING QUALITY
CHILD CARE AFFORDABLE AND ACCESSIBLE FOR ALL.
[CHEERING] AS A MOTHER MYSELF OF THREE
YOUNG CHILDREN, I KNOW HOW HARD
IT IS TO WORK WHILE RAISING A
FAMILY.
I ALSO KNOW THAT I'M FAR MORE
FORTUNATE THAN MOST. AMERICAN FAMILIES NEEDED RELIEF. POLICIES THAT ALLOW WOMEN WITH
CHILDREN TO THRIVE SHOULD NOT BE NOVELTIES, THEY SHOULD BE THE
NORM. POLITICIANS TALK ABOUT WAGE EQUALITY, BUT MY FATHER HAS MADE
IT A PRACTICE AT HIS COMPANY THROUGHOUT HIS ENTIRE CAREER.
[CHEERING] HE WILL FIGHT FOR EQUAL PAY,
EQUAL WORK AND I WILL FIGHT FOR THIS RIGHT ALONGSIDE OF HIM.

<p class='short_transcript'> >> AMERICANS TODAY NEED AN

RISE AGAIN. A TRUMP PRESIDENCY WILL TURN THE ECONOMY AROUND AND RESTORE THE GREAT AMERICAN TRADITION<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> OF
GIVING EACH NEW GENERATION HOPE FOR BRIGHTER OPPORTUNITIES AND
THOSE OF THE GENERATION THAT
CAME BEFORE. AND DONALD TRUMP, YOU HAVE A CANDIDATE WHO KNOWS THE
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WANTING SOMETHING DONE AND MAKING IT
HAPPEN.
[CHEERING] WHEN MY FATHER SAYS THAT HE WILL
BUILD A TOWER, KEEP AN EYE ON THE SKYLINE. 4 X 4, A SOARING STRUCTURE WILL
APPEAR, USUALLY RECORD SETTING AND ICONIC IN ITS DESIGN. REAL PEOPLE ARE HIRED TO DO REAL
WORK.
VISION BECOMES REALITY. WHEN MY FATHER SAID THAT HE WILL
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, HE WILL DELIVER.
[CHEERING] WE HAVE A CHANCE THIS YEAR TO
RECLAIM OUR HERITAGE OF THE
COUNTRY THAT CARRIES BIG AND
MAKES THE IMPOSSIBLE HAPPENED. FORTUNATELY, DONALD TRUMP IS
INCAPABLE OF THINKING SMALL. WHEN I WAS A CHILD, MY FATHER
ALWAYS TOLD ME, IF YOU'RE GOING
TO BE THINKING ANYWAY, YOU MIGHT
AS WELL THINK BIG. AS PRESIDENT, MY FATHER WILL TAKE ON THE BOLD AND WORTHY
FIGHT.
HE WILL BE UNAFRAID TO SET LOFTY
GOALS AND HE WILL BE RELENTLESS
IN HIS DETERMINATION TO ACHIEVE THEM. TO PEOPLE ALL OVER AMERICA, I SAID, WHEN YOU HAVE MY FATHER AND YOUR CORNER, YOU WILL NEVER AGAIN HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT BEING
LET DOWN.
HE WILL FIGHT FOR YOU ALL THE
TIME, ALL THE WAY, EVERY TIME.
[CHEERING] MAYBE IT IS THE DEVELOPER AND
HIM, BUT DONALD TRUMP CANNOT
STAND TO SEE EMPTY MAIN STREET
AND BOARDED UP FACTORIES. HE CAN'T BEAR THE INJUSTICE OF
COLLEGE GRADUATES WHO ARE
CRIPPLED BY STUDENT DEBT AND
MOTHERS WHO CAN'T AFFORD THE
COST OF CHILDCARE, REQUIRED TO RETURN TO WORK.
[CHEERING] OTHERS SEE THE HARDSHIPS OF THE
UNFAIRNESS AND SAY THEY FEEL FOR
YOU. ONLY MY FATHER WILL SAY, I WILL FIGHT FOR YOU.
[CHEERING] THE HARD-WORKING MEN AND WOMEN
OF THIS COUNTRY IDENTIFY WITH MY
FATHER.
HE IS TOUGH AND HIS PERSEVERING.
HIS HONEST AND REAL. HE IS AN OPTIMIST AND HE IS A RELENTLESS BELIEVER IN AMERICA AND ALL OF HER POTENTIAL. HE LOVES HIS FAMILY AND HE LOVES
HIS COUNTRY WITH HIS HEART AND
HIS SOUL. POLITICIANS ASK TO BE JUDGED BY
THEIR PROMISES, NOT THE RESULTS, I ASK YOU TO JUDGE MY FATHER BY HIS RESULTS.
JUDGES BODIES BY THOSE HE HAS
INSTILLED IN HIS CHILDREN. JUDGES COMPETENCY BY THE POWERS
HE HAS BUILT. THE COMPANIES HE FOUNDED AND THE
TENS OF THOUSANDS OF JOBS HE HAS
CREATED. HE IS THE SINGLE MOST QUALIFIED
PERSON TO SERVE AS CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF AN TRILLION DOLLAR
ECONOMY.
-- $18 TRILLION ECONOMY. MY FATHER WILL CALL UPON THE
BEST AND BRIGHTEST PEOPLE FROM ALL SPHERES OF INDUSTRY AND BOTH
SIDES OF THE AISLE. A NEW SET OF THINKERS TO FACE
OUR COUNTRY'S EXISTING AND
FUTURE PROBLEMS WITH FRESH PERSPECTIVE AND BRAVE, NEW
SOLUTIONS. COME JANUARY 17, ALL THINGS WILL BE POSSIBLE AGAIN. WE CAN HOPE AND DREAM AND THINK
BIG AGAIN. NO ONE HAS MORE FAITH IN THE AMERICAN PEOPLE BEEN MY FATHER. HE WILL BE YOUR GREATEST,
TRUEST, MOST LOYAL CHAMPION.
[CHEERING] THIS IS THE FIGHTER, THE VIEWER
YOU HAVE CHOSEN AS YOUR NOMINEE IN WAYS NO ONE EXPECTED. THIS MOMENT IN THE LIFE OF OUR
COUNTRY HAS DEFINED THE MISSION
AND GIVEN IT TO EXTORT A MAN.
HE IS READY TO SEE IT ALL -- EXTRAORDINARY MAN. READY TO SEE IT ALL THE WAY
THROUGH. SPEAK EVERY MAN AND EVERY WOMAN
OF EVERY BACKGROUND IN EVERY
PART OF THIS COUNTRY. TO EARN YOUR TRUST AND YOUR
BOAT. THAT AND MUCH MORE FROM THE A
LONG TIME AGO, I HAVE LOVED AND RESPECTED HIM MY ENTIRE LIFE AND I COULD NOT BE MORE PROUD TONIGHT TO PRESENT TO YOU AND TO ALL OF AMERICA MY FATHER AND OUR NEXT PRESIDENT, DONALD J TRUMP.

CLINTON, WHAT DO WE HAVE?
ISIS HAS SPREAD ACROSS THE REGION AND THE ENTIRE WORLD. LIBYA IS IN RUINS, AND OUR AMBASSADOR AND HIS STAFF WERE
LEFT HELPLESS TO DIE AT THE HANDS OF SAVAGE KILLERS. EGYPT WAS TURNED OVER TO THE RADICAL MUSLIM BROTHERHOOD,
FORCING THE MILITARY TO RETAKE CONTROL. IRAQ IS IN CHAOS. IRAN IS ON THE PATH TO NUCLEAR WEAPONS. SYRIA IS ENGULFED IN A CIVIL WAR AND A REFUGEE CRISIS THAT NOW THREATENS THE WEST. AFTER 15 YEARS OF WARS IN THE MIDDLE EAST, AFTER TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS SPENT AND THOUSANDS OF

DOES NOT HAVE TO BE AMERICA'S LEGACY.
THE PROBLEMS WE FACE NOW,
POVERTY AND VIOLENCE AT HOME, WAR AND DESTRUCTION ABROAD,<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> WILL

RELYING ON THE SAME POLITICIANS
WHO CREATED THEM.
A CHANGE IN LEADERSHIP IS REQUIRED TO PRODUCE A CHANGE IN OUTCOMES.
[CHEERING] TONIGHT, I WILL SHARE WITH YOU FOR ACTION FOR AMERICA.
THE MOST IMPORTANT DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN OUR PLAN AND THAT OF OUR
OPPONENTS, IS THAT OUR PLAN WILL PUT AMERICA FIRST.
[CHEERING] AMERICANISM, NOT GLOBALISM, WILL
BE OUR CREDO.
[CHEERING] AS LONG AS WE ARE LED BY POLITICIANS WHO WILL NOT PUT AMERICA FIRST, THEN WE CAN BE ASSURED THAT OTHER NATIONS WILL
NOT TREAT AMERICA WITH RESPECT.
THE RESPECT THAT WE DESERVE.
[CHEERING] THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WILL COME
ONCE AGAIN. FIRST[CHEERING] MY PLAN WILL BEGIN WITH SAFETY AT HOME WHICH MEANS SAFE NEIGHBORHOODS, SECURE BORDERS,
AND PROTECTION FROM TERRORISM. THERE CAN BE NO PROSPERITY WITHOUT LAW AND ORDER.
[CHEERING] ON THE ECONOMY, I WILL OUTLINE REFORMS TO ADD MILLIONS OF NEW JOBS AND TRILLIONS IN NEW WEALTH THAT CAN BE USED TO REBUILD AMERICA. A NUMBER OF THESE REFORMS THAT I WILL OUTLINE TONIGHT WILL BE OPPOSED BY SOME OF OUR NATION'S
MOST POWERFUL SPECIAL INTERESTS.
THAT IS BECAUSE THESE INTERESTS
HAVE RIGGED OUR POLITICAL AND
ECONOMIC SYSTEM FOR THEIR
EXCLUSIVE BENEFIT. BELIEVE ME. IT IS FURTHER BENEFIT.
-- FOUR THEIR BENEFIT. BIG BUSINESS, ELITE MEDIA AND
MAJOR DONORS ARE LINING UP
BEHIND THE CAMPAIGN OF MY
OPPONENT BECAUSE THEY KNOW SHE
WILL KEEP OUR RIGGED SYSTEM IN
PLACE. THEY ARE THROWING MONEY AT HER
BECAUSE THEY HAVE TOTAL CONTROL
OVER EVERY SINGLE THING SHE
DOES.
SHE IS THEIR PUPPET, AND THEY PULL THE STRINGS. THAT IS WHY HILLARY CLINTON'S
MESSAGE IS THAT THINGS WILL
NEVER CHANGE. NEVER EVER. MY MESSAGE IS THAT THINGS HAVE TO CHANGE AND THEY HAVE TO CHANGE RIGHT NOW.
[CHEERING] EVERY DAY I WAKE UP DETERMINED
TO DELIVER A BETTER LIFE FOR THE
PEOPLE ALL ACROSS THIS NATION THAT HAD BEEN IGNORED, NEGLECTED

BE FORGOTTEN LONG.

BUT NO LONGER HAVE A VOICE.
I AM YOUR VOICE.
