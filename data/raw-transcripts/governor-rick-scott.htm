<strong>Rick Scott</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> GOOD EVENING. MY NAME IS RICK SCOTT, GOVERNOR OF THE GREAT STATE OF FLORIDA.
[CHEERING] BEFORE I BEGIN TONIGHT, I WANT
TO EXPRESS MY GRATITUDE TO EVERYONE<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> WHO HAS KEPT US IN THE
PRAYER AFTER THE HORRIFIC AND
HATE FILLED TERRORISM ATTACK IN
ORLANDO MONTHS AGO. WE HAVE RECEIVED OUTPOURINGS OF
LOVE AND SUPPORT FROM AMERICANS EVERYWHERE. AMERICAN PEOPLE SURE STICK UP
FOR EACH OTHER.
ON BEHALF OF ALL THE CITIZENS OF OUR GREAT STATE, THANK YOU,
THANK YOU, THANK YOU.
[CHEERING] I'M OLD ENOUGH TO REMEMBER WHEN
TERRORISM WAS SOMETHING THAT
HAPPENED IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES,
NOT TODAY. HOW MANY MORE TIMES IS THE EVIL
OF RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM
HAVE TO INCUR -- OCCUR BEFORE
THE PRESIDENT WILL MUSTER THE COURAGE TO FACE THE TRUTH? HOW MANY MORE ORLANDOS? SAN BERNARDINOS? OR FT. HOODS WILL HAPPEN UNTIL
PRESIDENT OBAMA DESIRE TO BE HONEST -- DECIDE TO BE HONEST? I CRIED WITH THE GRIEVING MOMS AND DADS, BROTHERS AND SISTERS
OF THE 49 PEOPLE SLAUGHTERED BY THE ISIS INSPIRED TERRORIST. THIS WAR IS REAL.
IT IS HERE IN AMERICA. AS THE NEXT PRESIDENT --AND THE
NEXT PRESIDENT MUST DESTROY THIS EVIL.
[CHEERING] DONALD TRUMP IS THE MAN FOR THAT JOB.
[CHEERING]
>> TRUMP!
>> I MET DONALD TRUMP ABOUT 20
YEARS AGO BEFORE EITHER OF US
DECIDED TO RUN FOR OFFICE. LET ME TELL YOU WHY THIS IS THE
TIME FOR DONALD TO BE PRESIDENT. A LOT OF POLITICIANS LIKE TO
GIVE SPEECHES WHERE THEY SAY, WE
ARE AT A CROSSROADS.
THAT IS NOT WHERE WE ARE TODAY. TODAY, AMERICANS HAVE A RECORD
HIGH DEBT. OUR ECONOMY IS NOT GROWING. OUR JOBS ARE GOING OVERSEAS. WE'VE ALLOWED OUR MILITARY TO DECAY AND WE PROJECT WEAKNESS ON
THE INTERNATIONAL STAGE. WASHINGTON GROWS WHILE THE REST
OF AMERICA STRUGGLES. THE DEMOCRATS HAVE NOT LED US TO
A CROSSROADS, THEY HAVE LET US TO A CLIFF.
[CHEERING] I KNOW THAT SOME HAVE
RESERVATIONS ABOUT MY FRIEND AMONG COME, PERHAPS HE IS
SOMETIMES NOT LIKE, IN A STATEMENT -- CAN BE A LITTLE ROUGH AND MAYBE A LITTLE DIRECT.
THIS ELECTION IS NOT ABOUT
DONALD TRUMP OR HILLARY CLINTON,
IN FACT, IT IS NOT THE ELECTION
ABOUT YOU OR ME, THIS IS
ELECTION ABOUT -- THIS ELECTION IS ABOUT THE AMERICAN DREAM AND ITS SURVIVAL.
[CHEERING] IT IS TIME FOR ALL AMERICANS TO
PUT DOWN THE PARTISAN BANNERS, VOTE FOR THE SURVIVAL OF THE
GREATEST COUNTRY IN THE WORLD
AND TO THE RIGHT THING FOR THIS
COUNTRY.
BUT FOR DONALD TRUMP.
-- VOTE FOR DONALD TRUMP.
[CHEERING] FINALLY, I HAVE SOME GREAT NEWS. THIS IS THE TIME AMERICA HAS
BEEN WAITING FOR. THIS YEAR WE GET TO FIRE THE POLITICIANS.
[CHEERING] AND WHO BETTER TO LET THE POLITICIANS KNOW YOU'RE FIRED
THAN DONALD TRUMP?
[CHEERING] WE NEED A PRESIDENT WHO HAS PUT
THE INCORRECT AND WILL TELL IT
LIKE IT IS.
[CHEERING] WE NEED A PRESIDENT WHO IS NOT AFRAID OF WASHINGTON. WE NEED A PRESIDENT WHO DOES NOT
BELIEVE GOVERNMENT IS THE ANSWER
TO EVERY PROBLEM.
[CHEERING] WE NEED A PRESIDENT WHO
RECOGNIZES THAT GREAT COUNTRIES HAVE ORDERS -- BORDERS. WE NEED A PRESIDENT WILL BRING
AMERICAN JOBS BACK TO AMERICA.
[CHEERING] WE NEED A PRESIDENT WHO IS NOT AFRAID TO SAY RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM.
[CHEERING] AND WE NEED A PRESIDENT WHO WILL WIPE ISIS OFF THE FACE OF THE
EARTH.
[CHEERING] AND ON EVERY ONE OF THESE MEASURES, HILLARY CLINTON FAILS. SHE FAILS, SHE FAILS, SHE FAILS.
[CHEERING]
>> LOCK HER UP! LOCK HER UP! LOCK HER UP!
>> AMERICA IS WORTH FIGHTING FOR.
LET'S MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. LET'S ELECT DONALD TRUMP AS THE
NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED
STATES OF AMERICA.
[CHEERING] THANK YOU AND GOD BLESS THIS GREAT COUNTRY!
