<strong>Tom Cotton</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> TOM COTTON: THANK YOU. FOR YEARS WE'VE SEEN WHAT
HAPPENS WHEN AMERICA LEADS FROM
BEHIND. THAT IS THAT IS NOT WITH THE
ARMY TAUGHT ME. FOR EVERYONE WHO<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> AGREES THAT
AMERICA SHOULD LEAD THE WAY, I
HAVE A MESSAGE. HELP IS ON THE WAY.
[APPLAUSE] LET ME TELL YOU A STORY. IN ARKANSAS FARM BOY WHO BECAME
A SOLDIER. WHEN AMERICA WAS A WAR HE WAS AWAY AT SCHOOL. THEN IN A COMFORTABLE PROFESSIONAL JOB EXEMPT FROM
SERVICE.
HE SACRIFICED THAT COMFORT AGAINST THE WISHES OF HIS FAMILY. HE VOLUNTEERED FOR THE ARMY.
HE BECAME AN INFANTRYMAN. THAT BOY WAS MY DAD. HE WENT TO VIETNAM IN 1969.
[APPLAUSE] 35 YEARS LATER BECAUSE OF 9/11 I DID THE SAME.
[APPLAUSE] AGAINST THE WISHES OF MY FAMILY
I GIVE UP MY LEGAL CAREER I
VOLUNTEERED FOR THE ARMY. I BECAME AN INFANTRYMAN AND I
WENT TO IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN. MY DAD SAID HE FELT LIKE GOD WAS
PUNISHING HIM FOR WHAT HE DID TO
HIS DAD. BUT GOD WAS NOT PUNISHING HIM. GOD HAD CALLED US TO SERVE. JUST AS HE CALLED SO MANY OF YOU
TO SERVE AS WELL. MY FAMILY ISN'T EXTRAORDINARY. FROM THE FARMS OF ARKANSAS TO
THE FIRE STATIONS IN NEW YORK,
SO MANY FAMILIES CAN TELL THE
SAME STORY. THE DEFENSE OF THIS COUNTRY IS ALWAYS A FAMILY AFFAIR AND THESE FAMILIES SHOULDER MORE THAN
THEIR SHARE OF THE TASK. WE DON'T FIGHT BECAUSE WE HATE
OUR ENEMIES BUT BECAUSE WE LOVE
OUR COUNTRY.
[APPLAUSE] WE LOVE ITS FREEDOM AND WE LOVE
THAT WE ARE BORN EQUAL AND NO ONE CAN BOSS US AROUND. THESE THINGS ARE WORTH FIGHTING
FOR AND DYING FOR. THEY MAKE LIFE WORTH LIVING FOR. OUR WARRIORS AND THEIR FAMILIES
DON'T ASK FOR MUCH. WE ARE BLESSED TO SERVE AND WE
ARE GRATEFUL FOR THE GENEROSITY
OF OUR FELLOW CITIZENS. WE WOULD LIKE A
COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF WHO SPEAKS OF
WINNING WARS AND NOT JUST ENDING
WARS.
[APPLAUSE] WE WOULD LIKE A
COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF WHO CALLS ITS
ENEMY BY ITS NAME. A COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF WHO DRAWS REDLINES CAUTIOUSLY BUT ENFORCES
THEM RUTHLESSLY. IT WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE A COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF WHO COULD BE
TRUSTED TO HANDLE CLASSIFIED
INFORMATION.
[APPLAUSE] WE DID LIKE POLITICIANS WHO
TREAT OUR COMMON DEFENSE AS THE CHIEF RESPONSIBILITY OF THE GOVERNMENT, NOT JUST ANOTHER
GOVERNMENT PROGRAM. THIS IS NOT MUCH TO ASK FOR. EIGHT YEARS WITHOUT IT IS MORE THAN ENOUGH. ANOTHER FOUR YEARS IS
UNTHINKABLE. LET ME QUOTE THE LAST REPUBLICAN VICE PRESIDENT ABOUT THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE LAST TIME A
CLINTON WAS IN THE WHITE HOUSE. IN A TRUMP AND HENCE
ADMINISTRATION AND WITH A
REPUBLICAN CONGRESS HEALTH --
HELP IS ON THE WAY.
[APPLAUSE]
[APPLAUSE] BELIEVE ME, NO MAN WANTS MORE WARS ONCE YOU'VE SEEN THE FACE OF WAR. I HAVE PLANNED MEMORIAL SERVICES
FOR FALLEN COMRADES IN THE
MOUNTAINS OF AFGHANISTAN. I HAVE CARRIED TO THEIR FLAG
DRAPED CASKETS ONTO PLANES. I HAVE BURIED THEM IN ARLINGTON
NATIONAL CEMETERY. THE WISDOM OF THE AGES CONFIRMS
THE COUNCIL OF OUR FIRST PRESIDENT TO BE PREPARED FOR WAR IS ONE OF THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAYS OF PRESERVING PEACE. THE PURPOSE OF OUR COMMON DEFENSE IS TO PROTECT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND PRESERVE OUR
INDEPENDENT SO THAT WE CAN ENJOY
THE BLESSINGS OF PEACE. FAITH, FREEDOM, FAMILY AND PROSPERITY.
WHY FATHER AND HIS FATHER WERE WILLING TO FIGHT SO THAT THEIR
CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN COULD
LIVE IN PEACE. SADLY, THAT WAS NOT TO BE. MY GENERATION IS FIGHTING, HAS
FOUGHT AND WILL FIGHT SO THAT OUR CHILDREN, MY INFANT SON GABRIEL AND THE CHRISTMAS BABY MY WIFE AND I ARE EXPECTING,
MIGHT ONE DAY LIVE IN PEACE.
[APPLAUSE] FOR THAT CAUSE, I SPEAK TONIGHT
NOT ONLY TO REPUBLICANS BUT TO
THE MILLIONS OF INDEPENDENTS AND
DEMOCRATS WHO SHARE THAT DREAM
AND WISH TO MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN. THANK YOU AND GOD BLESS YOU.
[APPLAUSE]
