<strong>Greg Walden</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> REP. WALDEN: HEY, GOOD AFTERNOON.
I'M THRILLED TO BE IN CLEVELAND
AS WE WORK TOGETHER TO RETAKE THE WHITE HOUSE AND PUT AMERICA BACK ON THE RIGHT TRACK.<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> OVER THE LAST EIGHT YEARS -- OVER THE LAST EIGHT YEARS, HOUSE REPUBLICANS HAVE ACTED AS THE FIRST LINE OF DEFENSE AGAINST THE DESTRUCTIVE POLICIES THE
OBAMA ADMINISTRATION. DURING PRESIDENT OBAMA'S FIRST
TWO YEARS IN OFFICE, DEMOCRATS
CONTROLLED BOTH HOUSES OF CONGRESS AND WE ALL SAW THE
RESULTS OF THAT. LOWER DEFICIT SPENDING, HIGHER TAXES, AND A GOVERNMENT TAKEOVER
OF HEALTH CARE.
IN 2010, YOU HELPED US TURN THAT
TIDE. AS CHAIRMAN OF THE NATIONAL
REPUBLICAN CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEE, MY JOB IS TO ELECT
REPUBLICANS TO THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, AND I'M PROUD TO TELL YOU THAT, FROM MAINE TO
MIAMI, FROM ARIZONA TO ALASKA,
WE HAVE ELECTED REPUBLICANS TO
THE HOUSE AND NOW HOLD OUR
LARGEST MAJORITY SINCE THE 1920'S.
[APPLAUSE] SINCE THAT TIME, WE'VE DONE
EVERYTHING IN OUR POWER TO BLOCK
THE LIBERAL AGENDA AND BEGIN REINING IN DEFICIT SPENDING. PRESIDENT OBAMA, INSTEAD OF
WORKING WITH CONGRESS, HAS CONTINUED PUSHING HIS EXTREME
PARTISAN POLICY THROUGH AN
UNPRECEDENTED LEVEL OF EXECUTIVE
AND REGULATORY OVERREACH.
WE FIND HIM IN CONGRESS. WE FOUGHT HIM IN CONGRESS AND IN
THE COURTS. WE ARE BEGINNING TO WIN.
WE ARE GOING TO WIN THIS FALL. OF COURSE, ANY DISCUSSION OF
PRESIDENT OBAMA'S FAILURES HAVE TO START WITH OBAMACARE. UNDER THIS FLAWED LAW, HEALTH
CARE HAS BECOME ANYTHING BUT
AFFORDABLE. INSURANCE PREMIUMS AND HEALTH CARE COSTS -- THEY'VE SKYROCKETED. ANOTHER ROUND OF DOUBLE-DIGIT RATE HIKES ARE SET TO HIT CONSUMERS THIS  NOVEMBER. OBAMACARE IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN A
PRESIDENT CARES MORE ABOUT SECURING A POLITICAL WIN THAN SETTING GOOD POLICY FOR OUR
COUNTRY. IN CONTRAST, SPEAKER PAUL RYAN'S
LEADERSHIP, HOUSE REPUBLICANS HAVE PUT FORWARD PATIENT
-CENTERED HEALTH CARE THAT WILL
BE AFFORDABLE FOR FAMILIES. WE ARE OFFERING A REAL
ALTERNATIVE AND SHOWING VOTERS THAT REPUBLICANS ARE THE PARTY
OF NEW AND GOOD IDEAS, WHILE DEMOCRATS ARE CLEARLY THE PARTY OF THE FAILED STATUS QUO, ESPECIALLY ON HEALTH CARE. DONALD TRUMP WILL BE OUR PARTNER
IN THIS EFFORT AND, TOGETHER, WE
WILL REPLACE OBAMACARE WITH REAL
HEALTH CARE REFORM THAT WORKS
FOR ALL AMERICANS. BUT, YOU KNOW WHAT? OBAMACARE IS JUST THE TIP OF THE
ICEBERG WHEN IT COMES TO THE
OBAMA ADMINISTRATION'S OVERREACH. AS MY FRIENDS FROM THE OREGON
DELEGATION KNOW, IN MY DISTRICT,
OVER HALF THE LAND BASES
CONTROLLED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, DECISIONS BY
UNELECTED BUREAUCRATS THOUSANDS
OF MILES AWAY IN WASHINGTON,
D.C., HAVE A LEVEL OF INFLUENCE
OVER THE PEOPLE THAT IS
UNIMAGINABLE TO MOST PARTS OF
OUR NATION. THESE ARE OUR PUBLIC LANDS AND
WE MUST PROVIDE BETTER
STEWARDSHIP OF THEM. HOUSE REPUBLICANS ARE LEADING THE FIGHT AGAINST THE OBAMA-CLINTON REGULATORY REGIME. AND WE KNOW THERE'S A BETTER SOLUTION. WASHINGTON NEEDS TO BE A BETTER
LISTENER. WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND FROM ALL PEOPLE, WITH ALL WALKS OF LIFE,
ALL REGIONS OF OUR COUNTRY, THAT
THE REAL SOLUTIONS START AT THE GRASS LEVEL.
HILLARY CLINTON HAS MADE CLEAR
THAT SHE WILL DOUBLE DOWN ON THE WORST OF THE OBAMA-ERA POLICIES AND, INDEED, GO EVEN FURTHER, ADVOCATING FOR THE MOST EXTREME
LEFT-WING DEMOCRAT PLATFORM
AMERICA HAS EVER SEEN. IT'S TIME TO MOVE OUR COUNTRY IN
A NEW DIRECTION, TO START
CREATING JOBS INSTEAD OF KILLING THEM, AND TO GROW OUR ECONOMY BY ENCOURAGING INNOVATION INSTEAD
OF STIFLING IT WITH OVERREGULATION. AS PRESIDENT RONALD REAGAN ONCE SAID, "THERE ARE NO GREAT LIMITS TO GROWTH, BECAUSE THERE ARE NO LIMITS OF HUMAN INTELLIGENCE, IMAGINATION, AND WONDER." SO I HOPE YOU WILL JOIN WITH US
IN BUILDING ON A REPUBLICAN HOUSE MAJORITY.
VISIT OUR WEBSITE AT NRCC.ORG TO LEARN MORE ABOUT OUR EFFORTS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR WHAT YOU
DO.
GOD BLESS YOU, AND GOD BLESS THE
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.
[APPLAUSE]
