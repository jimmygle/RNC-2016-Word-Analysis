<strong>Pam Bondi</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> NEW YORK, ARE YOU PLOWED.
-- PROUD. FLORIDA, I LOVE YOU. NOVEMBER 8 IS A DAY OF
RECKONING. FOR ALL THOSE WHO HAVE ABUSED
THEIR POWERS. THE DAY WHEN<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> WE THE PEOPLE WILL
TAKE BACK OUR GOVERNMENT. FROM WASHINGTON BUREAUCRATS PLAYING DR. WITH OUR HEALTH
CARE. THE PRESIDENT IS IN PLAIN FAST
AND LOOSE WITH OUR COUNTRY AND CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS AND
RUSSIAN ROULETTE WITH OUR
BORDERS. NOVEMBER 8 IS WHEN AMERICA FEELS
SAFE AGAIN.
[CHEERING] BECAUSE THAT IS WHEN AMERICA WI NS AGAIN.
[CHEERING] BECAUSE WINNING THIS ELECTION MEANS RECLAIMING SOMETHING TO WHICH I HAVE DEDICATED MY ENTIRE LIFE AND CAREER. THE RULE OF LAW.
[CHEERING] LAWS  THAT MAKE OUR
NEIGHBORHOODS SAFE. LAWS THAT MAKE OUR ECONOMY STRONG. LAWS THAT APPLIED EQUALLY TO
EVERYONE.
[CHEERING] AND LOUISIANA, NOW MORE THAN EVER, LAWS THAT BACK OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT. THEY HAVE OUR BACK, AND DONALD TRUMP WILL HAVE YOUR BACK.
[CHEERING] BUT TODAY, THESE LAWS ARE UNDER
SIEGE. UNDER SIEGE BY PRESIDENT DETERMINED TO IGNORE LAWS AND HE
DOES NOT LOCK -- LIKE AN BY A
FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE WHO
BELIEVES THE LAWS DO NOT APPLY TO HER.
>> BOO!
>> AND BY THE WAY, SHE DESERVES NO SECURITY CLEARANCE.
[CHEERING] HOW DO YOU BECOME PRESIDENT OF
THE UNITED STATES AND YOU HAVE
NO SECURITY CLEARANCE -- WHEN
YOU HAVE NO SECURITY CLEARANCE? THIS LAWLESSNESS MUST STOP RIGHT
HERE, RIGHT NOW. DONALD TRUMP WILL STOP IT.
[CHEERING] LOCK HER UP.
I LOVE THAT. STAY WITH ME. DONALD IS GOING TO ROLL BACK OBAMA'S UNCONSTITUTIONAL EXECUTIVE ORDERS, HANG ON, DONALD IS GOING TO ROLL BACK OBAMA'S UNCONSTITUTIONAL ORDERS, HE WILL ENFORCE OUR IMMIGRATION
LAWS TO KEEP US SAFE, WHILE ALLOWING ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS TO
BLESS THE STATION WITH THEIR -- THIS NATION WITH THEIR TALENTS AND DREAMS. AND CALIFORNIA, TEXAS, NEW MEXICO, ARIZONA, DONALD TRUMP
WILL TAKE CONTROL OF OUR
BORDERS.
[CHEERING] BECAUSE WE MUST STOP THE INFLUX OF COCAINE AND HEROINE COMING
INTO OUR COUNTRY, MY STATE AND
KILLING OUR KIDS. AND THEN THERE IS THIS HILLARY
LEAVES OUR ENEMIES, THIS IS UNREAL, HILLARY BELIEVES OUR ENEMIES TO SERVE OUR -- DESERVE
OUR RESPECT AND EMPATHY.
>> BOO!
>> DONALD TRUMP BELIEVES! TERRORISTS DESERVE TO DIE.
[CHEERING] HILLARY WILL STACK THE SUPREME
COURT WITH LIBERAL JUSTICES WHO
WILL ALLOW GOVERNMENT TO CONTINUE ITS RAMPAGE AGAINST OUR
INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS. WITH UTTER CONTEMPT FOR OUR SECOND AMENDMENT. I KNOW DONALD AND I'M PROUD TO
KNOW DONALD. HE WILL APPOINT CONSERVATIVE JUSTICES WHO WILL DEFEND RATHER THAN REWRITE OUR CONSTITUTION.
[CHEERING] I HAVE ONE QUESTION FOR ALL OF
YOU HERE TODAY, ARE YOU READY TO SEND ISIS A MESSAGE THAT WE ARE
REALLY COMING AFTER THEM?
[CHEERING] WHEN DONALD TRUMP AS PRESIDENT HE WILL.
[CHEERING] AMERICA, ON NOVEMBER 8, REMEMBER THIS, IF YOU BELIEVE IN LIMITED GOVERNMENT, IF YOU BELIEVE IN OUR HISTORIC CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS, IF YOU BELIEVE IN THE
RULE OF LAW, IF YOU BELIEVE IT
IS TIME FOR AMERICA TO START ACTING LIKE AMERICA AGAIN, THERE IS ONLY ONE CHOICE IN THIS ELECTION: DONALD TRUMP!
[CHEERING] AMERICA FOR TRUMP AND SO AM I. GOD BLESS AMERICA AND GOD BLESS
THE TRUMP FAMILY! THANK YOU.

<strong>Unidentified Speaker</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> FIRST ENTRY IS THE DREAM HAS
BACKING FROM NIGHT SKIES PART IN
THE LIGHT OF A MILLION STARS ON
QUIET, CLEAR NIGHTS.
IT IGNITED THE MINDS OF PEERLESS<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> AND DETERMINED INDIVIDUALS WHO
SUMMONED THE COURAGE TO BREAK
THE RULES OF GRAVITY. 47 YEARS AGO, JULY 20, 1969, A YOUNG MAN FROM OHIO TOOK ONE GIANT LEAP FOR MANKIND.
WE CELEBRATE THE MEMORY AND SELFLESS COURAGE OF NEIL ARMSTRONG AND THE APOLLO 11
TEAM. HE WOULD REMIND US OF ALL THOSE WHO CAME BEFORE HIM TO MAKE HIS JOURNEY INTO HISTORY POSSIBLE. LIKE HIS TWO YOUNG BROTHERS FROM
JUST DOWN THE ROAD IN DAYTON, ORVILLE AND WILBUR BUILT THE
FIRST SUCCESSFUL PLAYING IN THE
BACK OF THEIR BICYCLE SHOP. BEFORE WE KNEW IT, THE RACE FOR
SPACE WAS ON.
BY 1958, THE NATION COMMITTED TO WINNING AND NASA WAS BORN. THE SKIES WERE NO LONGER THE
LIMIT. AMERICA AIMED FOR THE MOON AND THE STARS. WHILE ALL THAT WAS HAPPENING,
ANOTHER YOUNG HERO FROM CAMBRIDGE, OHIO WAS WRITING HIS OWN CHAPTER. A DECORATED FIGHTER PILOT AND COMBAT VETERAN, JOHN GLENN BECAME THE FIRST AMERICAN TO
ORBIT THE EARTH ON FEBRUARY 20,
1962. SOON, BRAVE WOMEN EMERGED BEYOND BREAKING GLASS CEILINGS, THEY
BROKE DOWN BARRIERS AND THE
EARTH ATMOSPHERE. YOU WILL MEET ONE OF THEM IN A
MOMENT.
AT THE AGE OF 23, EILEEN COLLINS
BECAME THE FIRST FEMALE FLIGHT INSTRUCTOR IN THE HISTORY OF THE
UNITED STATES AIR FORCE.
SHE BECAME THE FIRST WOMAN TO
PILOT THE SPACE SHUTTLE.
LATER SHE BECAME THE FIRST TO
COMMAND A SPECIAL MISSION.
THEN, AFTER THE NATION GROUP THE
LOSS OF SPACE SHUTTLE MONDAY, SHE FEARLESSLY LET OUR FIRST COMMISSION -- MISSION BACK INTO SPACE AND SHE BROUGHT IT BACK
SAFELY AND THE WHOLE WORLD BREATHED A SIGH OF RELIEF. AMERICA'S ASTRONAUTS, STRIVING
TO SEE THEIR COUNTRY ACHIEVED GREATNESS INSPIRED BY THE STAR SKIES ON CLEAR NIGHTS AND
ACCOMPLISH MEN'S OF THOSE
PIONEERS WHO PRECEDED THEM.
WHAT IS IT ABOUT THIS GREAT COUNTRY WHERE SO MANY HAVE
RISKED SO MUCH AND TRAVELED SO
FAR INTO THE HEAVENS? THERE ARE MANY ANSWERS IN THE
EYES OF THESE BRAVE MEN AND
WOMEN, BUT THERE IS ONE WE ALL SHARE, THEY LOVE THEIR COUNTRY
SO DEEPLY THEY WERE WILLING TO RISK THEIR LIVES TO KEEP IT STRONG AND MAKE A GREAT.
-- MAKE IT GREAT. YOU LOOK TO THE HEAVENS TONIGHT,
TAKE A MINUTE TO THANK GOD FOR
EACH AND EVERY ONE OF THEM. AND STAND NEXT TO THE U.S. WILL
SOON RECLAIM ITS RIGHT PLACE AS
THE LEADER IN SPACE EXPIRATION
-- EXPLORATION BECAUSE IT WILL SUMMON THE COURAGE AND STRENGTH TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. WHEN FUTURE ASTRONAUTS LOOK UP
TO THE NIGHT SKY, THEY ONE OTHER
COUNTRIES WE CAN FOR THEM. GREATNESS ABOUNDS AND ONCE AGAIN, THE STARS ARE THE LIMITS.
