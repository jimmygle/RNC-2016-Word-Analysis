<p class='short_transcript'> >> CAN SUSTAIN THE NATION WHEN
WE FIND OURSELVES IN PERIL.
THIS IS SUCH A TIME. FROM 9/11 TO RUSSIAN AGGRESSION,
TO A BELLIGERENT CHINA, AND TO
THE EVIL<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> OF THE ISLAMIC STATE, WE FACE UNPARALLELED THREATS, BUT WE STAND HERE TONIGHT ON THE
SHOULDERS OF GIANTS AND LEGENDS WHO GAVE US THIS AMERICAN REPUBLIC THAT WHEN WE THINK OF THOSE WHO PIONEERED THIS COUNTRY
WITH COURAGE AND HONOR THROUGH A BLOODY REVOLUTION, AND THOSE WHO
GAVE THEIR LIVES FOR THE CAUSE
OF FREEDOM AROUND THE WORLD, TODAY, AT THIS CRUCIAL POINT IN OUR HISTORY, CAN WE SUMMON THE SPIRIT THAT FORGED OUR NATION
AND BOUND US TOGETHER UNDER PRINCIPLES OF LIBERTY AND
JUSTICE FOR ALL?
[CHEERING] USA. IT IS TIME FOR US, ONCE AGAIN TO
CHOOSE FREEDOM OVER TYRANNY.
[CHEERING] OVER THE LAST EIGHT YEARS, THE
U.S. HAS TRADED THE ROLE OF ACTIVE LEADERSHIP FOR THAT OF A
PASSIVE OBSERVER. AMERICANS HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT THE U.S. HAS ALWAYS BEEN A FORCE FOR GOOD AND THAT SINCE WE HAVE MADE MISTAKES, WE SHOULD FORFEIT
OUR LEADERSHIP OR GOD FOR BID, WE SHOULD LEAVE THEM BEHIND. THAT THINKING HAS ENDANGERED NOT
JUST THE U.S., BUT FREEDOM
ACROSS THE WORLD AND THOSE RESULTS ALL SQUARELY ON THE SHOULDERS OF OUR CURRENT ADMINISTRATION SUPPORTED BY
HILLARY CLINTON. HER LEADERSHIP WAS ABSENT AS U.S. MARINES WERE FORCED TO
MATCH THEIR WEAPONS WHILE BUREAUCRATS ABANDONED OUR EMBASSY AND IT WAS ABSENT AS OUR ENEMIES OVERRAN ANOTHER CONFLICT
AND KILLED FOUR OF OUR AMERICANS
AT BENGHAZI. LOCK HER UP.
>> LOCKER UP! LOCKER UP! -- LOCK HER UP!
>> THIS LEADERSHIP THINK OUR
ENEMIES AND ARE ON THEIR KNEES. IT IS TIME WE PUT SOME INTO
OFFICE WHO HOLDS THE SAME
CONVICTIONS THAT WE HOLD. THE SAME CONVICTIONS THAT MY
FELLOW WARRIORS AND I HOLD.
THE SAME CONVICTIONS THAT MY FRIENDS LED OR DIED FOR. AS SERVICE MEMBERS, WE LIVE BY
THESE CONVICTIONS. USA.
CAP FIRED UP.
[CHEERING] IMAGINE A COUNTRY WHERE OUR PRESIDENT SHARES THOSE CONVICTIONS AND APPLES THE HONOR
OF OUR MILITARY, AND PRESIDENT
WHO KNOWS OUR PAST AND DEFEND
OUR LIBERTY. WITH THAT LEADERSHIP, WE WILL GO OVER THE TOP AND INTO THE TEETH OF THIS 21ST CENTURY.
" AMERICA, WE WILL HAVE THAT LEADERSHIP.
[CHEERING] GOD BLESS AMERICA.
AND DONALD TRUMP AMERICA, THE ONLY TIME SERVICE MEMBERS WILL
GET ON THEIR KNEES WILL BE TO
THINK THEIR GOD THAT THEY ARE
AMERICANS.
[CHEERING] GOD BLESS YOU AND THANK YOU AND
GOD BLESS AMERICA!
