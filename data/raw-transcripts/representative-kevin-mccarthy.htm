<strong>Kevin McCarthy</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> THANK YOU. I AM PROUD TO BE A CONSERVATIVE FROM CALIFORNIA.
[APPLAUSE]
>> THAT WE HAVE LISTENED IN YOU
HAVE TOLD US "ENOUGH." ENOUGH OF WASHINGTON<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> BAILOUTS
AND HANDOUTS AND ENOUGH OF FEELING LESS SAFE AND SECURE IN
A MORE DANGEROUS WORLD WHERE THE
BAD GUYS ARE WINNING AND THE GOOD GUYS ARE LOSING.
BUT I HAVE GOOD NEWS. IN 112 DAYS, IT IS OVER.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] IN THIS ELECTION, THE STAKES
HAVE NEVER BEEN HIGHER. DO WE SETTLE FOR THE PATH WE ARE ON OR DO WE TAKE A BETTER WAY? NOW, REPUBLICANS BELIEVE
FAMILIES WHO WORK HARD SHOULD
GET AHEAD. REPUBLICANS BELIEVE IN AMERICA
THAT ISN'T DIVIDED BY RACE, RELIGION, GENDER. REPUBLICANS BELIEVE THAT AMERICA ONLY WORKS IF WE PUT YOUR INTERESTS ABOVE THE SPECIAL INTERESTS. THE LIES WE ARE TOLD ABOUT OBAMACARE, THE DESTRUCTION OF
JOBS AND ENTIRE INDUSTRIES, THE EMPOWERMENT OF A RAN -- IRAN AND THE RISE OF ISIS.
REPUBLICANS HAVE A BETTER WAY.
WE HAVE A PLAN TO FIX IT AND AND
OUR AGENDA, OUR ENEMIES WILL
FEAR US.
[APPLAUSE] OUR TAXES WILL BE FAIR. PEOPLE WILL BE ABLE TO AFFORD
THE HEALTH CARE THEY WANT. THE PEOPLE'S VOICE WILL BE
HEARD. GOVERNMENTS WILL HELP THOSE WHO TRULY NEED IT AND IT WILL ALLOW EVERYONE TO RISE. FOR THOSE WHO ARE LEFT BEHIND THE ECONOMIC FORCES OUT OF YOUR CONTROL, WE HEAR YOU. TO THOSE WHO ARE ATTACKED FOR
YOUR BELIEFS, WE HEAR YOU. TO A NATION THAT SEES CHAOS
SPREADING ACROSS AMERICA AND THE GLOBE, WE FEAR YOU. AND FOR OUR MEN AND WOMEN IN UNIFORM, WE HEAR YOU. NOW AS A MATTER OF PRINCIPLE,
YOU WILL HAVE THE VERY BEST
AMERICA HAS TO OFFER. THOSE WHO HAVE FOUGHT ON THE
FRONT LINES SHOULD NEVER HAVE TO WAIT IN LINE. THERE IS A BETTER WAY BUT THIS
REPUBLICAN AGENDA CAN ONLY BE
REALIZED IF WE DISRUPT THE
STATUS QUO AND LET'S ADMIT
HILLARY CLINTON IS THE DEFINITION OF STATUS QUO.
WE NEED A LEADER WHO SHAPES THE
FUTURE.
THE DEMOCRATS WON'T BRING THE
FUTURE BECAUSE THEY ARE STUCK IN
THE PAST.
WHEN INNOVATION HAVE BROUGHT MORE POWER TO THE PEOPLE, DEMOCRATS WANT MORE POWER FOR
WASHINGTON. WHEN INNOVATION ADVANCES
TECHNOLOGY, HILLARY CLINTON USES IT TO PUT AMERICAN SECRETS AT
RISK. THIS IS NOT THE PATH FOR OUR
COUNTRY. IT MEANS DIFFICULT TIMES, I REMEMBER THE WORDS OF RONALD REAGAN WHEN HE DESCRIBED AMERICA
AS THAT SHINING CITY UPON THE
HILL. ELECTING A REPUBLICAN CONGRESS, DONALD TRUMP, MIKE PENCE, WE CAN
BUILD A BETTER AMERICA AND MAKE THAT SHINING CITY ON THE HILL
RIGHT AGAIN. THANK YOU AND GOD BLESS AND GOD
BLESS AMERICA.
