DONE. THE PODIUM HAS BEEN ABANDONED. THERE IS NO ONE STANDING AT THE
PODIUM. SO, YOUR GUESS IS AS GOOD AS
MINE. I HAVE NO RIGHT TO OCCUPY THAT
PODIUM AND I DO NOT WANT TO
OCCUPY THE BOY. WHAT I WANT IS A ROLLCALL VOTE
WHICH IS OUR RIGHT AS DELEGATES. WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO SPEAK TO

ADOPTED. I DO NOT KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN BY
WHAT WOULD THAT PROVE, THIS IS
WHAT YOU DO IT CONVENTION SPIRIT
TO IMPROVE -- AT CONVENTIONS. TO IMPROVE THE RULES. I HAVE NEVER IN ALL MY LIFE -- NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS. THERE IS NO PRECEDENT FOR THIS

IN THE RULES OF THE REPUBLICAN
NATIONAL CONVENTION. WE ARE NOW IN UNCHARTED TERRITORY. SOMEBODY OWES US AN ISOLATION. I HAVE NEVER SEEN THE CHAIR ABANDONED LIKE THAT. THE EXIT THE STAGE ENTIRELY.
-- EXITED THE STAGE ENTIRELY. NORMALLY YOU WOULD PASS RAISE A
POINT OF ORDER OR MAKE A VOTE. THAT WILL BE DEALT WITH BY THE
CHAIR. WHEN THE CHAIR ABANDONED HIS POST AS HAPPENED MOMENTS AGO,
THERE IS NO ROLE FOR THAT.
-- RULE FOR THAT. IS COMPLETELY UNHEARD OF FOR THE
CHAIR TO WALK OFF THE POST. MAYBE THERE WAS A MEDICAL EMERGENCY, MAYBE HIS MOM CALLED WITH BAD NEWS FROM HOME, I DON'T
KNOW. BY THIS -- UNDER RULE 39

AND IT CONVENTION, YOU VOTE ON ADOPTING A SET OF RULES WHICH
WILL GOVERN THE CONVENTION.
THIS IS VERY NORMAL. IT IS NOT UNHEARD OF FOR SOMEBODY THAT I WILL CALL VOTE ON A VOTE THEY THINK IS IMPORTANT AND WE FOLLOW THE

PETITIONS, MY STATEMENT AND
OTHER STATES SUBMITTED PETITIONS.
I REALLY AND WE FOLLOW THE
