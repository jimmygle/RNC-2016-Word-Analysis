<strong>Michelle Van Etten</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> I WAS ONE ENTREPRENEUR AND
DREAMER. BY THE TIME I WAS SIX OR SOLD, I
KNEW IT. MY DREAM WAS TO BE A CIRCUS PERFORMER.
SO I DECIDED I WAS GOING TO HAVE<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> A CIRCUS AT MY HOUSE. I MADE TICKETS, I WENT DOOR-TO-DOOR AND SOLD THOSE
TICKETS. I TRUST MY BABY BROTHER LIKE A CLOWN. AND I EVEN TAUGHT MY DOG SOME
NEW TRICKS. I WAS READY FOR MY BIG DAY. AS MY GUEST ON TO ARRIVE, MY
PARENTS HAD NO IDEA I WAS GOING TO HAVE A CIRCUS. THEY APOLOGIZED TO MY GUESTS AND REFUNDED MY MONEY, I WAS SO UPSET. AFTERWARDS, MY DAD TOLD ME ANY DREAM YOU HAVE, HE CAN DO. AS LONG AS YOU ARE DOING THE
WORK IT TAKES TO GET THE JOB
DONE.
[CHEERING] AFTER YOU GO TO COLLEGE. I CAN'T WAIT, I WANT TO NOW. I DECIDED I WAS GOOD TO TAKE MY DAD'S ADVICE AND I RECRUITED THE NEIGHBORHOOD KID TO BE PART OF
MY CIRCUS AND WE CHARGED OUR PARENTS TO WATCH THE SHOW. I HAD MY CIRCUS FOR OVER A YEAR. MY DAD TOLD ME I MADE RATE CANDY
MONEY THAT YOU. FAST-FORWARD, GOING TO MY HIGH
SCHOOL REUNION, MY 20 YEAR, I
DECIDED TO SCOPE OUT THE COMPETITION AND WHAT I REALIZED,
THE GIRLS I WENT TO SCHOOL WITH, THEY WERE DRIVING BMWS AND LOOK
LIKE BARBIES. I WAS 30 POUNDS OVERWEIGHT, A STAY-AT-HOME MOM AND DRIVING A MINIVAN. I DECIDED AT THAT POINT I NEEDED A CHANGE AND I BEGAN TO DREAM AGAIN. FOOD I TOOK A LEAP OF FAITH AND DECIDED TO OPEN UP MY OWN
HOME BASED BUSINESS. WHEN I REALIZE, WHEN YOU GO
AFTER A DREAM, YOU ARE GOING TO
HAVE TO LEARN HOW TO FAIL FORWARD AND NEVER QUIT. I ALSO LEARNED THAT I HAD TO
LEVEL UP TO BECOME THE TYPE OF PERSON THAT I WANTED IN MY
BUSINESS. AFTER TWO YEARS, I WAS ABLE TO
RETIRE MY HUSBAND, AFTER 28 YEARS IN THE DOD. TODAY, MY HUSBAND STAYS AT HOME
WITH OUR CHILDREN AND HE HOMESCHOOLS THEM BECAUSE I WILL
NOT SUBJECT THEM TO COMMON CORE.
[CHEERING] I OWN A SMALL BUSINESS. IN FLORIDA. HOUSE OF STYLE. FLORIDA DOES ROCK! TODAY, I RUN A MULTIFACETED
BUSINESS. MULTIFACETED INTERNATIONAL
BUSINESS. AND I AM LIVING THE AMERICAN DREAM.
[CHEERING] BUT THAT DREAM IS IN JEOPARDY. MY FEAR, THE NEXT GENERATION, THE MILLENNIALS TO OVER 50% HAVE
AN ULTRA NUMERAL.
AND WHAT TO BE THEIR OWN BOSS
WILL NOT BE ABLE TO BECAUSE OF
EIGHT YEARS OF LIBERALS.
[CHEERING] THEY HAVE OVERTAXED US, OVERREGULATED US AND THEY ARE KILLING THE AMERICAN DREAM. SMALL BUSINESSES ARE THE
BACKBONE OF AMERICA, WE NEED
ENTREPRENEURS. DELETED -- WE LIVE IN THE LAND
OF OPPORTUNITY AND WE NEED TO
PROTECT THE AMERICAN DREAM ABOVE ALL ELSE.
[CHEERING] THE AMERICAN DREAM IS BEING DENIGRATED. BECAUSE OF WHAT IS GOING ON. AND WE NEED A CHANGE AND IF YOU
WANT TO CHANGE, AND IF YOU
BELIEVE THAT WE CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE, THEN WE NEED TO HAVE
A PRESIDENT WHO IS A BUSINESSMAN AND NOT A HILLARYCRAT. WHO BELIEVES THAT BUSINESS IS
THE BACKBONE OF AMERICA. IT WILL NOT RAISE -- WHO WILL NOT RAISE TAXES. IT WILL PROTECT OUR CHILDREN AND
AND COMMON CORE. WHO WILL REPEAL OBAMA CARE AND
ALLOW SMALL BUSINESSES TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE HEALTH CARE FOR
THEIR EMPLOYEES AGAIN, WHO WILL
FOSTER CREATIVITY AND INNOVATION, WHO WILL BRING BACK MANUFACTURING. WHO WILL TAKE CARE OF THE
AMERICAN PEOPLE AND MAKE AMERICA
GREAT AGAIN.
[CHEERING] THERE IS ONLY ONE MAN CAPABLE OF
THIS JUGGLING ACT, ONLY ONE MAN
WHO CAN HANDLE THE CIRCUS WE
HAVE INHERITED FOR THE PAST EIGHT YEARS AND SERVE AS THE ULTIMATE RINGMASTER, THERE IS
ONLY ONE MAN WHO CAN PROTECT THE AMERICAN FUTURE FOR MANY
GENERATIONS AND BATMAN IS DONALD
TRUMP -- THAT MAN IS DONALD TRUMP!
[CHEERING] THANK YOU.</span><span class='hidden-full-transcript-ellipses'>...</span></p><a href='#' class='hidden-full-transcript-link'><i class='icon-chevron-down'></i> <span class='link-show-full-text'>Show Full Text</span><i class='icon-chevron-up'></i> <span class='link-show-less-text'>Show Less Text</span></a>
