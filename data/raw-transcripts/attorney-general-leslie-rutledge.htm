<strong>Leslie Rutledge</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> GEN RUTLEDGE: GOOD EVENING. SOMETIMES HILLARY CLINTON SPEAKS
WITH A NEW YORK ACCENT.
SOMETIMES AN ARKANSAS ACCENT. BUT Y'ALL, THIS IS WHAT A REAL ARKANSAS<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> WOMAN SOUNDS LIKE. HILLARY MAY NOT KNOW WHERE SHE IS FROM, BUT ARKANSANS KNOW
EXACTLY WHO SHE IS. AKRKANSANS KNOW WHO I AM,
MARRIED TO A ROAD CROP FARMER. I AM A CHRISTIAN PRO-LIFE GUN
CARRYING CONSERVATIVE WOMAN.
[APPLAUSE] AND I AM THE FIRST FEMALE AND
FIRST REPUBLICAN ELECTED ATTORNEY GENERAL OF ARKANSAS.
[APPLAUSE] THE VERY SAME OFFICE BILL CLINTON HELD WHEN THOSE TWO
LAUNCHED THEIR CAREERS OF CORRUPTION. HILLARY SAYS WHEN THEY LEFT THE WHITE HOUSE, THEY WERE POOR. WHILE THEY MADE MILLIONS, SHE IS
STILL POOR IN ALL THE WAYS THAT REALLY COUNT. POOR JUDGMENT, POOR POLICY, AND POOR DECISIONS. HILLARY IS A LAWYER, BUT SHE
ACTUALLY THE LAW DOESN'T APPLY
TO HER. ABSOLUTELY NO GOOD COULD HAVE
COME IN FROM MERGING HER PUBLIC SERVICE WITH HER PRIVATE INTERESTS. MUCH LESS HER PRIVATE SERVER. WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT HER SCNADALS IS BAD. WHAT WE DON'T KNOW MAYBE WORSE. WHY DID BILLS SPEAKING FEES
SKYROCKET AS SOON AS SHE BECAME
SECRETARY OF STATE? WHY DID A DONOR TO THE CLINTON FOUNDATION RECEIVED FAVORABLE
TREATMENT FROM THE STATE DEPARTMENT? DECEPTION AND DISHONESTY ARE ALL
SECOND INTERVIEW HILLARY/
. AS MY DADDY LIKES TO SAY, HILLARY WILL LIGHT EVEN WHEN THE
TRUTH WOULD SERVE HER BETTER.
[APPLAUSE] I BROKE A GLASS CEILING. I KNOW THE IMPORTANCE OF DOING SO. BUT A HISTORICAL MILESTONE NEED
NOT COME AT THE EXPENSE OF
AMERICA.
[APPLAUSE] UNLIKE HILLARY, DONALD TRUMP KNOWS THAT WOMEN AND MEN ARE NOT
SINGLE ISSUE VOTERS. WE CARE ABOUT JOBS, THE ECONOMY,
AND NATIONAL SECURITY. I KNOW THIS RACE WILL SHAKE THE
SUPREME COURT FOR GENERATIONS. DO WE WANT TO DELETE ANTONIN SCALIA TO BE REPLACED BY A LIBERAL ACTIVIST JUDGE? DONALD TRUMP WILL NOMINATE CONSERVATIVE JUSTICES WHO WILL
UPHOLD THE CONSTITUTION, SUPPORT
THE RULE OF LAW, AND RAIN AND
OUT OF CONTROL FEDERAL BUREAUCRATS.
[APPLAUSE] FRANKLY, HILLARY NEEDS TO GO TO HER OWN HOUSE AND NOT THE WHITE
HOUSE. AND SHE CAN TAKE RUTH BADER
GINSBURG WITH HER.
[APPLAUSE] MY FELLOW AMERICANS, IT'S TIME TO UPDATE YOUR RESUMES. DONALD TRUMP IS GROWING JOBS. WITH A TRUMP PRESIDENCY, AMERICA
WILL BE CLOSED TO OVERREGULATION
AND OPEN FOR BUSINESS. GOD BLESS EACH AND EVERYONE OF YOU AND GOD BLESS AMERICA. THANK YOU.
