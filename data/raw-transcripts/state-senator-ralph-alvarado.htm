<strong>Ralph Alvarado M.D.</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> GOOD EVENING.
IT IS A GREAT NIGHT TO BE AN
AMERICAN. FROM THE GREAT COMMONWEALTH OF
KENTUCKY, THE HOME OF HORSES, BOURBON, COAL, BLUEGRASS AND THE<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> FINEST PEOPLE ON EARTH,
ALLOW ME TO EXPRESS MY SINCEREST
APPRECIATION AND GRATITUDE FOR THE PRIVILEGE TO ADDRESS THIS
ASSEMBLY.
I'M PROUD TO STAND WITH YOU
TONIGHT AS THE FIRST HISPANIC MEMBER EVER ELECTED TO THE
KENTUCKY GENERAL ASSEMBLY.
[CHEERING] THANK YOU. BUT THE ROAD HERE WAS NOT AN EASY ONE. IT IS A LONG STORY OF THREE
FAILED POLITICAL RUNS AND
ADVERSITY. WITH A LOT OF DETERMINATION AND
GRIT AND HARDWARE, I TRY AND AND
AND I'M STANDING BEFORE YOU
TONIGHT.
[CHEERING] EVERYTHING I AM, EVERYTHING I ACHIEVED I/O TO GOD AND MY
PARENTS. MY FATHER WAS A PROUD LEGAL
IMMIGRANT FROM COSTA RICA.
MY MOTHER FROM ARGENTINA. BEING THE SON OF IMMIGRANTS, I
SAW FIRSTHAND THEIR SACRIFICE TO
PROVIDE OUR FAMILY A BETTER LIFE.
I WATCH THEIR STRUGGLE IN
MASTERING A SECOND LANGUAGE AND
THEIR STRONG AND QUIET
COMMITMENT TO HARD WORK. WE DID NOT HAVE THE LUXURY TO
OTHER FAMILIES HAD, WHAT MY
PARENTS TO GIVE ME WAS FAMILY STRUCTURE, DISCIPLINE, SUPPORT,
HIGH PERSONAL EXPECTATIONS, LOVE
AND FAITH IN GOD.
THEY WERE HISPANIC, AMERICANS,
AND VERY PROUD OF BEING BOTH.
[CHEERING] THEY UNDERSTOOD THE VALUE OF PRESERVING OUR CULTURE AND LANGUAGE, BUT ALSO THE VALUE OF AN EDUCATION AND PRIDE AND LOVE
FOR THE COUNTRY. LIGHT MOST IMMIGRANTS, THEY UNDERSTOOD THAT THEIR SACRIFICE
WOULD NOT PROVIDE THEM WITH IMMEDIATE SUCCESS, BUT THE
REWARD WOULD BE IN THE
OPPORTUNITY AND SUCCESS OF THEIR
CHILDREN AND THEIR GRANDCHILDREN
.
THE STORY IS NOT UNIQUE TO MY
ACCOUNT. IT IS THE STORY OF MANY LEGAL
LATINO IMMIGRANTS WHO COME TO
AMERICA. IT IS IMPORTANT FOR US TO
UNDERSTAND THAT HISPANICS BELIEVE WHAT REPUBLICANS BELIEVE. TRADITIONAL FAMILY VALUES, CHURCH, FAITH IN GOD, THE
DIGNITY OF WORK AND THE
OPPORTUNITY FOR SELF-SUFFICIENCY
THAT COMES FROM A FREE SOCIETY AND LIMITED GOVERNMENT.
[CHEERING] THEY HAVE SIMPLE DREAMS THAT MIGHT SEEM MUNDANE TO THE AVERAGE AMERICAN, BUT SOUND FAMILIAR TO OUR FOUNDING FATHERS AND THEIR CORE PRINCIPLES. THE DREAM OF LIBERTY AND FREEDOM. SOME LEAVE CRIME AND ANARCHY FOR
THE DUMA SAFER COMMUNITIES. SOME FLEE HUNGER AND DESPAIR FOR
THE DREAM OF OPPORTUNITY, ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND ABUNDANCE.
ALL OF THEM LEAVE THEIR HOMELAND FOR THE DREAM OF AMERICA, A PLACE WHERE IF YOU WORK HARD,
STUDY HARD AND OBEY OUR LAWS, YOU CAN ACCOMPLISH ANYTHING.
[CHEERING] OVER THE PAST EIGHT YEARS, OUR
PRESIDENT AND HIS APPRENTICE HILLARY CLINTON HAVE TALKED
ABOUT THAT AMERICAN DREAM, THAT
THEY HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA HOW
TO PROTECT IT, FOSTER IT OR
EXPENDED.
-- EXPANDED.
TODAY WE HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO IS
NOT ONLY FAILED TO END RACIAL TENSION, HE HAS MADE US MORE
DIVIDED THAN EVER. TODAY, WE HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO IS ITCHING TO RESTRICT OUR
FUNDAMENTAL CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS SUCH AS RELIGIOUS
LIBERTY, THE RIGHT TO BEAR ARMS
AND FREE SPEECH. TODAY, WE HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO HAS REJECTED HONESTY AND
TRANSPARENCY, LYING TO THE
AMERICAN PEOPLE OVER AND OVER AGAIN ABOUT OBAMA CARE, THE
PROMISE OF IMMIGRATION REFORM,
FAST AND FURIOUS, IRS ENEMY LIST, FOR CONEY BANKRUPTCY, BENGHAZI, THE V.A. SCANDAL, IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL, THEY LIST GOES ON AND ON.
[CHEERING] AND WITH HILLARY CLINTON, THIS
EIGHT-YEAR NIGHTMARE WILL GET
FAR WORSE. AMERICANS FACE A VERY IMPORTANT
DECISION. DO WE WANT SOMEONE WHO IS BRUTALLY HONEST, PERHAPS TO A
FAULT? OR DO WE WANT SOME WHO IS BRUTALLY DISHONEST? IT IS NOT A DECISION THIS YEAR
ABOUT AMERICA MOVING LEFT OR RIGHT, IT IS A DECISION ABOUT MOVING AMERICA UP OR DOWN.
[CHEERING] AND BY PROTECTING THE AMERICAN DREAMS WE CAN MAKE AMERICA FIRST AGAIN.
THERE IS ONLY ONE CANDIDATE WILL
PROTECT IT FOR OUR CURRENT AND
FUTURE GENERATIONS AND THAT
CANDIDATE IS DONALD TRUMP.
[CHEERING] NEVERTHELESS IT FOR MY SPANISH SPEAKING LATINO FRIENDS, - NUESTROS
[SPANISH]
[CHEERING] IN A MESSAGE FOR ONE MORE
PERSON. HILLARY CLINTON. YOU HAVE TO BE HISPANIC COMMUNITY AND YOU DON'T DESERVE
OUR BOAT.
-- VOTE.
[CHEERING] GOD BLESS THIS CONVENTION.
GOD BLESS OUR COUNTRY.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
[CHEERING]
