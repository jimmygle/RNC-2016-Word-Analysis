<strong>Ted Cruz</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> SEN. CRUZ: THANK YOU. THANK YOU, AND GOD BLESS EACH
AND EVERY ONE OF YOU. HEIDI AND I ARE SO HONORED TO
JOIN YOU HERE IN CLEVELAND WHERE LEBRON JAMES<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> JUST LED AN
INCREDIBLE COMEBACK VICTORY. AND I AM CONVINCED, AMERICA IS GOING TO COME BACK, TOO. I WANT TO CONGRATULATE DONALD TRUMP ON WINNING THE NOMINATION LAST NIGHT.
[APPLAUSE] SEN. CRUZ: AND LIKE EACH OF YOU,
I WANT TO SEE THE PRINCIPLES OF
THAT OUR PARTY BELIEVES PREVAIL
IN  NOVEMBER.
[APPLAUSE] SEN. CRUZ: CONVENTIONS ARE TIMES OF EXCITEMENT, BUT GIVEN THE EVENTS OF THE LAST FEW WEEKS, I
HOPE YOU WILL ALLOW ME A MOMENT
TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT WHAT IS
REALLY AT STAKE. JUST TWO WEEKS AGO, A NINE-YEAR-OLD GIRL NAMED CAROLINE WAS HAVING A CAREFREE TEXAS SUMMER, SWIMMING IN THE POOL, PLAYING WITH FRIENDS,
DOING ALL OF THE THINGS A HAPPY
CHILD MIGHT DO. LIKE MOST CHILDREN, SHE RELIED
UPON THE LOVE THAT SHE RECEIVED FROM HER MOM, HEIDI, AND HER DAD, A POLICE SERGEANT NAMED
MICHAEL SMITH. THAT IS, UNTIL HE BECAME ONE OF
THE FIVE POLICE OFFICERS GUNNED DOWN IN DALLAS. THE DAY HER FATHER WAS MURDERED, CAROLINE GAVE HIM A HUG AND A
KISS AS HE LEFT FOR WORK. BUT AS THEY PARTED, HER DAD
ASKED BEFORE. WHAT IF THIS IS THE LAST TIME
YOU EVER KISS OR HUG ME? LATER, AS SHE THOUGHT OF HER FALLEN FATHER, AND THAT LAST HEARTBREAKING HUG, CAROLINE
BROKE DOWN IN TEARS. HOW COULD ANYTHING EVER BE OK
AGAIN? MICHAEL SMITH WAS A FORMER ARMY
RANGER WHO SPENT DECADES WITH
THE DALLAS POLICE DEPARTMENT. I HAVE NO IDEA WHO HE VOTED FOR
IN THE LAST ELECTION OR WHAT HE THOUGHT ABOUT THIS ONE. BUT HIS LIFE WAS A TESTAMENT TO DEVOTION.
[APPLAUSE] SEN. CRUZ: HE PROTECTED THE VERY
PROTESTERS WHO MOCKED HIM
BECAUSE HE LOVED HIS COUNTRY AND
HIS FELLOW MAN. HIS WORK GAVE NEW MEANING TO
THAT LINE FROM LITERATURE, TO
DIE OF LOVE IS TO LIVE BY IT.
[APPLAUSE] SEN. CRUZ: AS I THOUGHT ABOUT
WHAT I WANTED TO SAY TONIGHT, MICHAEL SMITH'S STORY WEIGHT ON
MY HEART, MAYBE THAT IS BECAUSE HIS DAUGHTER CAROLINE IS ABOUT
THE SAME AGE AS MY ELDEST DAUGHTER, AND HAPPENS TO SHARE
THE SAME NAME. MAY BE IT IS BECAUSE I SAW A
VIDEO OF THAT DEAR, SWEET CHILD
CHOKING BACK SOBS AS SHE
REMEMBERED HER DADDY'S LAST
QUESTION TO HER. MAYBE IT IS BECAUSE WE LIVE IN A
WORLD WHERE SO MANY OTHERS THAT
HAD THEIR LIVES DESTROYED BY EVIL IN PLACES LIKE ORLANDO AND PARIS AND NICE AND BATON ROUGE. MAYBE IT IS BECAUSE OF THE
SIMPLE QUESTION ITSELF, WHAT IF THIS, RIGHT NOW, IS OUR LAST TIME? OUR LAST MOMENT TO DO SOMETHING
FOR OUR FAMILIES AND OUR COUNTRY? DID WE LIVE UP TO THE VALUES WE
SAY WE BELIEVE? DID WE DO ALL WE REALLY COULD? THAT IS REALLY WHAT ELECTION SHOULD BE ABOUT. THAT IS WHY YOU AND MILLIONS LIKE YOU DEVOTED SO MUCH TIME AND SACRIFICE TO THIS CAMPAIGN. WE ARE FIGHTING NOT FOR ONE PARTICULAR CANDIDATE OR ONE CAMPAIGN, BUT BECAUSE EACH OF US
WANTS TO BE ABLE TO TELL OUR
KIDS AND GRANDKIDS OUR OWN CAROLINES, THAT WE DID OUR BEST
FOR THEIR FUTURE AND OUR
COUNTRY.
[APPLAUSE]
[CHANTING USA] SEN. CRUZ: AMERICA IS MORE THAN JUST A LAND MASS BETWEEN TWO OCEANS. AMERICA IS AN IDEA, A SIMPLE BUT
POWERFUL IDEA. FREEDOM MATTERS.
[APPLAUSE] SEN. CRUZ: FOR MUCH OF HUMAN
HISTORY, GOVERNMENT POWER HAS BEEN THE UNAVOIDABLE CONSTANT IN
LIFE. GOVERNMENT DECREES AND THE
PEOPLE OBEY. BUT NOT HERE. WE HAVE NO KING OR QUEEN, WE
HAVE NO DICTATOR, WE THE PEOPLE CONSTRAIN GOVERNMENT.
[APPLAUSE] SEN. CRUZ: OUR NATION IS
EXCEPTIONAL BECAUSE IT WAS BUILT
ON THE FIVE MOST BEAUTIFUL AND
POWERFUL WORDS IN THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE, I WANT TO BE FREE.
[APPLAUSE] SEN. CRUZ: NEVER HAS THAT MESSAGE BEEN MORE NEEDED THAN
TODAY. WE STAND HERE TONIGHT, A NATION DIVIDED. PARTISAN RANCOR, ANGER, AND EVEN HATRED ARE TEARING AMERICA
APART. AND CITIZENS ARE FURIOUS, RIGHTLY FURIOUS AT A POLITICAL ESTABLISHMENT THAT CYNICALLY
BREAKS ITS PROMISES AND THEN
IGNORES THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE.
[APPLAUSE] SEN. CRUZ: WE HAVE TO DO BETTER, WE OWE OUR FALLEN HEROES MORE THAN THAT.
[APPLAUSE] SEN. CRUZ: OF COURSE, OBAMA AND
CLINTON WILL ALSO TELL YOU THAT
THEY CARE ABOUT OUR CHILDREN'S
FUTURE. AND I WANT TO BELIEVE THEM. BUT THERE IS A PROFOUND DIFFERENCE IN OUR TWO PARTIES' VISION FOR THE FUTURE.
[APPLAUSE] SEN. CRUZ: THERE IS IS THE PARTY THAT THINKS ISIS IS A JV TEAM,
THAT RESPONSE TO THE DEATH OF
AMERICANS IN BENGHAZI BY ASKING,
WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE? AND THINKS IT IS POSSIBLE TO
MAKE A DEAL WITH IRAN WHICH
CELEBRATES ITS HOLIDAYS, DEATH TO AMERICA DAY, AND DEATH TO ISRAEL DAY.
[BOOING] SEN. CRUZ: MY FRIENDS, THIS IS
MADNESS.
PRESIDENT OBAMA IS A MAN WHO
DOES EVERYTHING BACKWARDS. HE WANTS TO CLOSE ONE-TIME OBEY
-- GUANTANAMO BAY AND OPEN UP
OUR BORDERS.
HE EXPORTS JOBS AND IMPORTS
TERRORISTS. ENOUGH IS ENOUGH. AND I AM HERE TO TELL YOU THERE
IS A BETTER VISION FOR OUR
FUTURE, A RETURN TO FREEDOM. ON EDUCATION, YOUR FREEDOM TO
CHOOSE YOUR CHILD'S EDUCATION,
EVEN IF YOU'RE NOT AS RICH AS
HILLARY CLINTON OR BARACK OBAMA.
[APPLAUSE] SEN. CRUZ: ON HEALTH CARE, YOUR
FREEDOM TO CHOOSE YOUR OWN DOCTOR WITHOUT OBAMACARE.
[APPLAUSE] SEN. CRUZ: ON TAXES, YOUR FREEDOM TO PROVIDE FOR YOUR
FAMILY WITHOUT THE IRS BEATING
DOWN YOUR DOOR.
[APPLAUSE] SEN. CRUZ: THE INTERNET, KEEP IT
FREE FROM TAXES, FREE FROM REGULATION, AND DO NOT GIVE IT
AWAY TO RUSSIA AND CHINA.
[APPLAUSE] SEN. CRUZ: FREEDOM MEANS FREE SPEECH, NOT POLITICALLY CORRECT SPACES.
[APPLAUSE] SEN. CRUZ: FREEDOM MEANS
RELIGIOUS FREEDOM, WHETHER YOUR
CHRISTIAN OR JEW, MUSLIM OR
ATHEIST.
[APPLAUSE] SEN. CRUZ: WHETHER YOU'RE GAY OR
STRAIGHT, THE BILL OF RIGHTS PROTECTS THE RIGHTS OF ALL OF US TO LIVE ACCORDING TO OUR CONSCIENCE. FREEDOM MEANS THE RIGHT TO KEEP
AND BEAR ARMS AND PROTECT YOUR
FAMILY. FREEDOM MEANS THAT EVERY HUMAN
LIFE IS PRECIOUS AND MUST BE PROTECTED.
[APPLAUSE] SEN. CRUZ: FREEDOM MEANS SUPREME COURT JUSTICES WHO DO NOT DICTATE ALL OF THE, BUT INSTEAD, FOLLOW THE CONSTITUTION.
-- THE DO NOT DICTATE POLICY,
BUT INSTEAD, FOLLOW THE
CONSTITUTION. AND FREEDOM MEANS RECOGNIZING
THAT OUR CONSTITUTION ALLOWS
STATES TO CHOOSE POLICIES THAT
REFLECT LOCAL VALUES. COLORADO MIGHT DECIDE SOMETHING
DIFFERENT THAN TEXAS. NEW YORK, DIFFERENT THAN IOWA. THAT IS THE WAY IT IS SUPPOSED
TO BE, DIVERSITY.
[APPLAUSE] SEN. CRUZ: IF NOT, WHAT IS THE
POINT OF HAVING STATES TO BEGIN
WITH?
[APPLAUSE]
[CHANTING USA] SEN. CRUZ: HILLARY CLINTON
BELIEVES GOVERNMENT SHOULD MAKE
VIRTUALLY EVERY CHOICE IN YOUR
LIFE.
[BOOING] SEN. CRUZ: EDUCATION, HEALTH
CARE, MARRIAGE, SPEECH, ALL
DICTATED OUT OF WASHINGTON. BUT SOMETHING POWERFUL IS HAPPENING. WE HAVE SEEN IT IN BOTH PARTIES. WE HAVE SEEN IT IN THE UNITED KINGDOM, UNPRECEDENTED BREXIT VOTE TO LEAVE THE EUROPEAN UNION.
[APPLAUSE] SEN. CRUZ: VOTERS ARE OVERWHELMINGLY REJECTING THE POLITICAL ESTABLISHMENT AND
OVERWHELMINGLY REJECTING THE
GOVERNMENT.
[APPLAUSE] SEN. CRUZ: THAT IS A PROFOUND
OF, AND IT IS ONE EARNED BY EACH
AND EVERY ONE OF YOU. PEOPLE ARE FED UP WITH POLITICIANS WHO DON'T LISTEN TO THEM, FED UP WITH THE CORRUPT
SYSTEM THAT BENEFITS THE ELITES
INSTEAD OF WORKING MEN AND
WOMEN.
[APPLAUSE] SEN. CRUZ: WE DESERVE AN IMMIGRATION SYSTEM THAT PUTS
AMERICA FIRST, AND YES, BUILDS A WALL TO KEEP AMERICA SAFE.
[APPLAUSE] SEN. CRUZ: THE GOVERNMENT THAT
STOPS ADMITTING ISIS TERRORISTS AS REFUGEES.
[APPLAUSE] SEN. CRUZ: WE DESERVE A TRADE
POLICIES THAT PUT THE INTERESTS OF AMERICAN FARMERS AND MANUFACTURING JOBS OVER THE GLOBAL INTERESTS FOR THE
LOBBYISTS.
[APPLAUSE] SEN. CRUZ: AND IF WE STAND
TOGETHER AND CHOOSE FREEDOM, OUR
FUTURE WILL BE BRIGHTER. FREEDOM WILL BRING BACK JOBS AND
RAISE WAGES. FREEDOM OF WILL LIFT PEOPLE OUT OF DEPENDENCY TO THE DIGNITY OF WORK.
[APPLAUSE] SEN. CRUZ: WE CAN DO THIS. 47 YEARS AGO, TO THIS DAY, AMERICA BUT THE VERY FIRST MAN
ON THE MOON.
[APPLAUSE] SEN. CRUZ: THAT WAS THE POWER OF FREEDOM. OUR PARTY, THE REPUBLICAN PARTY, WAS FOUNDED TO DEFEAT SLAVERY.
[APPLAUSE] SEN. CRUZ: ABRAHAM LINCOLN, THE FIRST REPUBLICAN PRESIDENT,
SIGNED THE EMANCIPATION PROCLAMATION.
[APPLAUSE] SEN. CRUZ: TOGETHER, WE PASSED THE CIVIL RIGHTS ACT, AND
TOGETHER, WE THOUGHT TO
ELIMINATE JIM CROW LAWS.
[APPLAUSE] SEN. CRUZ: THAT IS OUR COLLECTIVE LEGACY, ALTHOUGH THE MEDIA WILL NEVER SHARE IT WITH YOU. THOSE WERE FIGHTS FOR FREEDOM,
AND SO IS THIS. SERGEANT MICHAEL SMITH STOOD UP
TO PROTECT OUR FREEDOM, SO DO
THE SOLDIERS AND SAILORS AND
AIRMEN AND MARINES EVERY DAY, FIGHTING RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM.
[APPLAUSE]
[CHANTING USA] SEN. CRUZ: AND SO DID THE FAMILY
OF ALTON STERLING, WHO BRAVELY
CALLED TO END THE VIOLENCE.
[APPLAUSE] SEN. CRUZ: SO DID THE FAMILIES
OF THOSE MURDERED AT THE CHARLESTON EMMANUEL CHURCH OVER GAVE -- WHO FORGAVE THAT
HATEFUL, BIGOTED MURDERER.
[APPLAUSE]
SEN. CRUZ: AND SO CAN WE. WE DESERVE LEADERS WHO STAND FOR PRINCIPLES, THE UNITE US ALL BEHIND SHARED VALUES, WHO CAST
ASIDE ANGER FOR LOVE. THAT IS THE STANDARD WE SHOULD
EXPECT FROM EVERYBODY. AND TO THOSE LISTENING, PLEASE,
DO NOT STAY HOME IN NOVEMBER.
[APPLAUSE] SEN. CRUZ: IF YOU LOVE OUR
COUNTRY, AND LOVE YOUR CHILDREN
AS MUCH AS I KNOW THAT YOU DO,
STAND AND SPEAK AND VOTE YOUR
CONSCIENCE, VOTE FOR CANDIDATES UP AND DOWN THE TICKET WHO YOU TRUST TO DEFEND OUR FREEDOM AND
TO BE FAITHFUL TO THE
CONSTITUTION.
[APPLAUSE]
[CHANTING WE WANT FROM -- TRUMP] SEN. CRUZ: I APPRECIATE THE ENTHUSIASM OF THE NEW YORK
DELEGATION. AND I WILL TELL YOU, IT IS LOVE OF FREEDOM THAT HAS ALLOWED
MILLIONS TO ACHIEVE THEIR
DREAMS. LIKE MY MOM, THE FIRST AND HER
FAMILY TO GO TO COLLEGE, AND MY
DAD, WHO IS HERE TONIGHT, WHO
FLED PRISON AND TORTURE IN CUBA,
COMING TO TEXAS WITH JUST $100 SEWN INTO HIS UNDERWEAR. AND IT IS LOVE THAT I HOPE WILL BRING COMFORT TO A GRIEVING
NINE-YEAR-OLD GIRL IN DALLAS. AND GOD WILLING, PROPEL HER TO MOVE FORWARD AND A DREAM AND SOAR AND MAKE HER DADDY PROUD. WE MUST MAKE THE MOST OF OUR MOMENTS TO FIGHT FOR FREEDOM, TO
PROTECT OUR GOD-GIVEN RIGHTS, EVEN IF -- EVEN WITH THOSE WITH
WHOM WE DO NOT AGREE, SO THAT
WHEN WE ARE OLD AND GRAY, AND
WHEN OUR WORK IS DONE AND WE
GIVE THOSE WE LOVE ONE FINAL KISS GOODBYE, WE WILL BE ABLE TO SAY, FREEDOM MATTERS AND I WAS
PART OF SOMETHING BEAUTIFUL.
[APPLAUSE] SEN. CRUZ: THE CASE WE HAVE TO MAKE TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, THE
CASE EACH PERSON IN THIS ROOM
HAS TO MAKE TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, IS TO COMMIT TO EACH OF THEM THAT WE WILL DEFEND FREEDOM
AND BE FAITHFUL TO THE
CONSTITUTION.
[APPLAUSE] SEN. CRUZ: WE WILL UNITE THE
PARTY, WE WILL UNITE THE
COUNTRY, BY STANDING TOGETHER
FOR SHARED VALUES BY STANDING FOR LIBERTY. GOD BLESS EACH AND EVERY ONE OF YOU, AND GOD BLESS THE UNITED
STATES OF AMERICA.
