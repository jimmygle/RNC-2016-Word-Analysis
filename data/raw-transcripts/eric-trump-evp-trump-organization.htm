<strong>Eric Trump</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> WOW! WOW! GOOD EVENING, CLEVELAND.
[CHEERING] WOW! IT IS SUCH AN HONOR TO BE HERE
FOR A MAN I LOVE SO, SO, SO, SO
MUCH. THAT IS MY FATHER.
[CHEERING]<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> 13 MONTHS AGO, MY FATHER; DOWN
AND TOLD US THE TIME HAD COME. HE COULD NO LONGER SIT IDLY BY
AND WATCH OUR BELOVED COUNTRY, THE COUNTRY THAT HAD GIVEN OUR
FAMILY SO MUCH SUCCESS, SO MUCH OPPORTUNITY CRUMBLE BEFORE OUR
VERY EYES. HE CONFIRMED TO US THAT HE WAS PREPARED TO ANNOUNCE HIS CANDIDACY FOR PRESIDENT OF THE
EYES STATES.
-- UNITED STATES. TO A KNOWLEDGE THAT OURS WOULD
NOT BE THE PAST, THAT WE SHOULD PREPARE OURSELVES FOR WHAT WAS
TO COME. THAT WE WOULD QUICKLY LEARN TO OUR TRUE FRIENDS WERE. WITHOUT HESITATION, WE EACH COMMITTED WITH UNWAVERING
SUPPORT. THIS TIME, NONE OF US COULD HAVE
PREDICTED WHAT LAY AHEAD.
THE RECORDS HE WOULD BREAK, THE
STADIUMS HE WOULD FILL, THE
MOVEMENT HE WOULD START. TODAY, MY FATHER STANDS BEFORE YOU WITH THE MOST PRIMARY VOTES
OF ANY REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE IN
THE HISTORY OF OUR NATION.
[CHEERING] HE SHATTERED VOTER RECORD REGISTRATION ACROSS THE COUNTRY TO DEFY THE PREDICTIONS OF EVERY SINGLE POLITICAL PUNDIT AND TURNED TRADITION OF INTO
MUST-SEE TV.
[CHEERING] HE HAS INSPIRED MULTIPLE GENERATIONS INCLUDING MY OWN. MILLENNIALS LIKE MYSELF WHO HAVE
SO LITTLE FAITH IN OUR POLITICIANS THAT THEY NO LONGER
EVEN CONSIDER PUBLIC SERVICE TO
BE A NOBLE CAREER. A YEAR AGO MY FATHER WAS A
BUSINESSMAN. LIKE MANY AMERICANS, EASILY COULD NO LONGER STAND TO SEE
WHAT WAS HAPPENING TO OUR GREAT
COUNTRY. HE COULD NO LONGER STAND TO SEE
SPECIAL-INTEREST DOLLARS DICTATE AND COMPETENT FOREIGN POLICY THAT PUTS FOREIGN COUNTRIES BEFORE OUR VERY OWN. HE COULD NO LONGER TOLERATE AN INEPT ADMINISTRATION THAT CONSIDERS GIVING $150 BILLION TO IRAN AND RELEASING FIVE RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISTS A SUCCESSFUL NEGOTIATION. HE COULD NO LONGER BEAR WITNESS
TO OUR CONTINUED SECOND
AMENDMENT ATTACKS.
[CHEERING] HE DID NO LONGER STAND TO SEE
THE WORDS CHRISTMAS STRIPPED FROM PUBLIC USE OR THE PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE REMOVED FROM OUR
SCHOOLS IN AN EFFORT TO BE POLITICALLY CORRECT.
[CHEERING] SO MY FATHER MADE A COURAGEOUS
DECISION TO SET ASIDE A COMPANY TO WHICH HE HAS DEDICATED HIS ENTIRE LIFE, TO SET ASIDE A
GLOBAL BRAND THAT HE HAS MADE
SYNONYMOUS WITH SUCCESS, QUALITY, UNCOMPROMISING, JUST
THE BEST.
AT A TIME WHEN THE PEOPLE AT THE
PINNACLE OF THEIR CAREER LIKE MY
FATHER WOULD HAVE HELD BACK HER
LIFESTYLE THAT HAS TRULY BECOME
THE EPITOME OF THE AMERICAN DREAM, MY FATHER INSTEAD CHOSE
TO GIVE BEDROOM BACK TO THE
PEOPLE IT HAS ALLUDED FOR SO LONG.
[CHEERING] AS DAUNTING AS A JOURNEY OF
SEEING IT WOULD BE, FOR HIM IT
WAS THE EASIEST DECISION IN THE
WORLD. AFTER ALL, WHO BETTER TO IMPLEMENT COMMON SENSE IS MISSED APPROACHES TO THE COUNTRY? WHO BETTER TO APPLY PRACTICAL
SOLUTIONS TO THE IMPRACTICAL DECISION-MAKING OF AN ADMINISTRATION THAT HAS BRED A
$19 TRILLION DEBT? ONE WHICH GOES UP BY $32,000 A
SECOND AND OVER $2 BILLION A DAY? WHO BETTER TO IMPLEMENT COMMON SENSE TAX REDUCTION FOR ONE OF
THE HIGHEST TAXED NATIONS OF THE
WORLD ALLOWING OUR CITIZENS TO
KEEP MORE OF WHAT THEY EARN AS
OPPOSED TO HAVE IT SQUANDERED AWAY BY OUR INEFFICIENT GOVERNMENT. WHO BETTER TO NEGOTIATE THE
RETURN OF CALLOUS AMERICAN MANUFACTURERS? LIKE THE DISCO, FOUR, CARRIER,
BACK TO THE UNITED STATES WHEN
THEY BEGAN THAN A MAN WHO IS SINGLE-HANDEDLY EMPLOYED TENS AND TENS AND TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE ACROSS THE COUNTRY.
[CHEERING] IT IS TIME FOR A PRESIDENT WITH
COMMON SENSE. IT IS A TIME FOR A PRESIDENT WHO
UNDERSTANDS THE ART OF THE DEAL
AND APPRECIATE THE VALUE OF A
DOLLAR. OUR TAX DOLLARS. IT IS TIME FOR THE PRESIDENT WHO
IS ALWAYS BEEN THE WANT TO SIGN
THE FRONT OF THE CHECK, NOT THE BACK. THROUGHOUT MY FATHER'S CAREER,
HE HAS BEEN REPEATEDLY CALLED ON
BY GOVERNMENT TO STEP IN AND SAVE THE OVER BUDGET PUBLIC PROJECT. THE ICONIC OLD POST OFFICE IN
WASHINGTON DC TO NAME ONE. BACK IN 2000 -- A CITY IN NEW YORK HAD TO REFURBISH A SIMPLE I
CAN RAKE IN CENTRAL PARK. THE PROJECT DRAGGED ON FOR SIX YEARS AND BLEW OVER $13 MILLION.
$5 MILLION OVER AN ALREADY
INFLATED AT YOU. THAT IS WHAT MY FATHER WHO OVERLOOKED THE DISASTROUS
CONSTRUCTION SITE FROM HIS
OFFICE WINDOW EACH AND EVERY DAY
DECIDED HE HAD TO STEP IN. DISGUSTED BY GOVERNMENT INCOMPETENCE AND INEPTITUDE, HE INVESTED $2 MILLION IN HIS OWN
MONEY TO COMPLETE THE PROJECT. WHAT HAD TAKEN THE CITY OVER
HALF A DECADE TO BOTCH, MY
FATHER COMPLETED LESS THAN SIX MONTHS AHEAD OF SCHEDULE AND OVER A MILLION DOLLARS UNDER BUDGET.
[CHEERING] IT IS TIME FOR A PRESIDENT WHO
CAN MAKE AMERICA RATE AGAIN,
AHEAD OF BUDGET AND AHEAD OF SCHEDULE, TOO!
[CHEERING] MY FATHER HAS REVITALIZED
NEIGHBORHOODS, SHAPED SKYLIGHTS
ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND TURNED
DREAMS INTO REALITY. IT IS WHAT HE DOES. IT IS WHO HE IS. OPRAH WINFREY WAS FAMOUSLY ASKED
MY FATHER IF HE EVER ENVISIONED
RUNNING FOR PRESIDENCY OF THE AD
STATES, HIS ANSWER, ONLY IF THEY
GOT SO BAD THAT I HAD NO CHOICE. ONLY IF THEY GOT SO BAD THAT I
HAD NO CHOICE. BUT LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, AND
THAT THEY HAS COME. AS I TRAVEL THE WORLD WITH MY
DAD BUILDING THE GREATEST GOLF
COURSES AND HOTELS, I SEE THE
UNMISTAKABLE LOOK IN HIS EYE.
I SEE IN HIS ID AND DIGNITY OF
FRUSTRATION OF DOMESTIC INFRASTRUCTURE THAT IS COMPLETE DISARRAY AND A LONGER ON PAR WITH SO MANY OTHER DEVELOPED
NATIONS. I SEE IN HIS EYES THE SADNESS OF
INNOCENT LIVES LOST LIKE THOSE OF KATE STEINLE AND SO MANY
OTHERS CUT SHORT BY ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS IN CENTURY CITY'S,
VICTIMS OF A REVOLVING DOOR OF
GOVERNMENT INEPTITUDE AND
CORRUPTION THAT LEAVES INNOCENT
AMERICANS DEFENSELESS.
[CHEERING] I SEE IN HIS EYES THE HUMILIATION OF AN EDUCATION SYSTEM RANKED 30TH IN THE WORLD. I SEE NEARLY $400 BILLION TRADE IMBALANCE WITH CHINA.
THE SAFETY LIGHT ON TRADE
IMBALANCE WITH MEXICO AND IT CONTINUES TO -- THE DISTINGUISHED OF THE MIDDLE EAST
WHICH HAS COST OUR NATION'S
TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND
THOUSANDS OF LIVES. TODAY AS HE IN HIS EYES, A MAN
WHO TRULY LOVES HIS COUNTRY. WHO IS PROUD OF HIS COUNTRY AND WHO ONCE HIS COUNTRY TO BE GREAT
AGAIN.
[CHEERING] I WANT TO THANK MY FATHER OVER THERE FOR THE LIFE HE HAS
PROVIDED ME.
FOR THE LIFE THAT HE PROVIDED MY
FAMILY AND THE LIFE THAT HE HAS
PROVIDED ALL OF OUR EMPLOYEES OF
THE WORLD. I WOULD DO THINK MY FATHER FOR
THE LIFE HE HAS ENABLED ME TO
PROVIDE FOR MY FUTURE CHILDREN
WITH MY BEAUTIFUL WIFE AS WE
START THINKING ABOUT THAT
AMAZING CAPTAIN -- CHAPTER OF
OUR LIVES. TO THAT END, I OFTEN THINK ABOUT
THE LEGACY I WAS TO LEAVE MY CHILDREN AND TO MEET, THERE ARE
FEW THINGS I HOLD CLOSER TO MY HEART AND CHARITY. FOR ME, IT IS THE ESSENCE OF WHO WE ARE AS HUMAN BEINGS, IT IS
THE BAROMETER BY WHICH WE ARE TO BE MEASURED FOR OUR TIME HERE ON
EARTH. AS MY LUTHER KING JUNIOR ONE
SAID, LIFE'S MOST PERSISTENT AND URGENT QUESTION IS WHAT ARE YOU
DOING FOR OTHERS? WHEN I WAS 22 YEARS OLD, I
FOUNDED THE AIR COME FOUNDATION TO BENEFIT ST. JUDE'S RESEARCH HOSPITAL, AN INCREDIBLE ORGANIZATION.
[CHEERING] I RUN MY FOUNDATION BASED ON THE
PRINCIPLES MY FATHER TAUGHT ME, HONESTY, INTEGRITY, AND VALUES. I EXPECT OTHER CHARITIES TO BE
RUN BY THE SAME MORAL CODE, NOT
TO SERVE AS CONDUIT FOR PERSONAL ENRICHMENT, NOT BECOME A BEACON OF CORRUPTION AND SCANDAL.
[CHEERING] TO WHOM MUCH IS GIVEN, MUCH WILL BE REQUIRED.
THIS IS A VERY BELIEVE I'VE TOLD MY FATHER TO MAKE THIS GREAT SACRIFICE.
TO RUN FOR THE MOST POWERFUL,
YET UNFORGIVING OFFICE IN THE
WORLD. THERE IS NO GREATER CALLING,
THERE IS NO MORE SELFLESS AND
ACT. TO THE UNEMPLOYED VOTERS AT HOME, WONDERING HOW YOU WILL
MAKE YOUR NEXT MORTGAGE PAYMENT OR OTHER PAYMENT, MY FATHER IS
RUNNING FOR YOU.
[CHEERING] TO THE VETERAN TUNING INTO THE
SPEECH FROM HIS OR HER HOSPITAL
WHO HAS BEEN IGNORED AND DISRESPECTED I AND UNGRATEFUL SYSTEM, MY FATHER IS RUNNING FOR
YOU.
[CHEERING] DO THE SCHOOLTEACHER FORCED TO WALK THROUGH METAL DETECTORS
EACH AND EVERY DAY TO AN
UNDERFUNDED SCHOOL, MY FATHER IS
RUNNING FOR YOU.
[CHEERING] TO THE LABOR WATCH ME RIGHT NOW,
FORCED TO HAVE A JOB I -- OUT OF A JOB AND DOCUMENT AND WORKERS, MY WATER -- FATHER IS RUNNING
FOR YOU.
[CHEERING] TO THE OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY WORKERS DENIED A JOB BECAUSE OF RADICAL REGULATIONS FROM THE RADICAL EPA, MY FATHER IS RUNNING FOR YOU.
[CHEERING] THE SINGLE MOTHERS, FAMILIES WITH RUSSIA NEEDS CHILDREN'S, MIDDLE-CLASS FAMILIES WHO CAN NO
LONGER AFFORD MEDICAL BENEFITS, SUFFICIENT TO COVER THEIR EVERYDAY NEEDS, MY FATHER IS
RUNNING FOR YOU.
[CHEERING] THIS NOVEMBER, ASKING TO BE TRUE
TO YOURSELF AND BOTH FOR THE
CANDIDATE YOU KNOW IS RUNNING
FOR THE RIGHT REASON. BUT FOR THE CANDIDATE WHO IS
NEVER BEEN A POLITICIAN, BUT FOR THE CANDIDATE WHO IS NEVER RECEIVED A PAYCHECK FROM OUR GOVERNMENT.
[CHEERING] THANK YOU. BUT FOR THE CANDIDATE WHO CAN'T
BE BOUGHT, SOLD, PURCHASED, COLORS, INTIMIDATED, OR STEER
FROM THE PAST THAT IS RIGHT,
JUST, AND TRUE.
[CHEERING] AND QUITE FRANKLY, FRIENDS, BUT
FOR THE ONE CANDIDATE WHO DOES
NOT NEED THIS JOB.
[CHEERING] NEVER HAVE I BEEN MORE PROUD TO
BE A TRUMP. NEVER HAVE I BEEN MORE PROUD TO BE MY FATHER SON. I'M INCREDIBLY HONORED TO BE PART OF THIS JOURNEY ON WHICH HE HAS INVITED OUR FAMILY TO PLAY
SUCH AN INTEGRAL PART. DAD, ONCE AGAIN YOU HAVE TAUGHT US BY EXAMPLE, YOU ARE MY HERO,
YOU ARE MY BEST FRIEND, YOU ARE THE NEXT RESIDENT OF UNITED -- PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.
[CHEERING] GOD BLESS AMERICA.
