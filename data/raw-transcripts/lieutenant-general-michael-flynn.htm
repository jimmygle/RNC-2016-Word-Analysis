<strong>Michael T. Flynn</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU FILE -- FOLLOW AN ACT AGAIN NEXT FIRST
LADY OF THE UNITED STATES OF
AMERICA.
ANOTHER BIG ROUND OF APPLAUSE
FOR HER.
[CHEERING]<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> UNBELIEVABLE AND WHAT AN
EXCITING NIGHT. I'M HERE TONIGHT AS A DETERMINED AMERICAN WHO LOVES OUR COUNTRY. AND MY MESSAGE TO YOU IS VERY
CLEAR. WAKE UP AMERICA.
[CHEERING] THERE IS NO SUBSTITUTE FOR AMERICAN LEADERSHIP AND EXCEPTIONALISM. AMERICA SHOULD NOT FEAR OUR
ENEMIES. IN FACT, WE SHOULD CLEARLY
DEFINE OUR ENEMIES. FACE THEM HEAD ON. AND THEN DEFEAT THOSE THAT SEEK
TO THREATEN OUR COUNTRY. AND OUR WAY OF LIFE. YOU ARE DONE RIGHT.
THAT IS RIGHT. GOOD FOR YOU. TONIGHT, WE STAND TOGETHER AS PROUD PATRIOTS WHO DEEPLY LOVE OUR COUNTRY AND BELIEVE IN THE
PRINCIPLES OF FREEDOM, DEMOCRACY, AND LIBERTY.
[CHEERING] USA, YOU ARE DONE RIGHT. GET FIRED UP. THIS IS ABOUT THIS COUNTRY. THIS IS ABOUT THE FUTURE OF OUR
CHILDREN. WE KNOW THAT AMERICA, OUR NATION, IS THE GREATEST COUNTRY
IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD. BUT THEY NEVER BE A SUBSTITUTE
FOR AMERICA AND LET US SUSTAIN THE CONVICTION THAT OUR COUNTRY
HOLDS A UNIQUE PLACE AND ROLE IN AMERICAN HISTORY, AMERICAN EXCEPTIONALISM MUST NEVER FADE, BUT NOW, IT IS UP TO US AND YOU CANNOT SIT THIS ELECTION OUT. I STAND WITH YOU AS A CITIZEN, AND VETERAN, A PATRIOT, BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY, AS AN AMERICAN. TO TELL YOU THAT THE DESTRUCTIVE PATTERN OF PUTTING THE INTEREST
OF OTHER NATIONS AHEAD OF OUR
OWN WILL AND WENT DONALD TRUMP IS PRESIDENT. TRUMP, TRUMP, TRUMP. THERE YOU GO.
EXACTLY. FROM THIS DAY FORWARD, FROM THIS DAY FORWARD, WE MUST STAND TOUGHER AND A STRONGER TOGETHER
WITH AN UNRELENTING GOAL TO NOT DRY REDLINE AND THEN RETREAT. AND TO NEVER BE SATISFIED WITH RECKLESS RHETORIC FROM AN OBAMA CLONE LIKE HILLARY CLINTON. WE MUST DRAW FROM A RICH FOUNDATION OF OUR FOUNDING FATHERS FIGHT FOR DEMOCRACY AND
LEAD OUR FRIENDS AND ALLIES WITH
MORE DETERMINATION THAN EVER
BEFORE. WITH CONVICTION, WITH CONVICTION
IN OUR POLICE THAT PIERCES
THROUGH THE IDEOLOGY OF ANY
PEOPLE OR ANY NATION THAT ATTACKS AMERICA, AMERICA'S WAY OF LIFE AND ARE PROUD HERITAGE OF FEARLESSNESS AND COURAGE.
[CHEERING] TONIGHT, AMERICA STANDS AS ONE. WITH STRENGTH AND CONFIDENCE TO OVERCOME THE LAST EIGHT YEARS OF
THE OF MONO -- OBAMA-CLINTON
FAILURES. BUMBLING INDECISIVENESS. WILL FOR IGNORANCE AND TOTAL
INCOMPETENCE. HAS CHALLENGED THE VERY HEART AND SOUL OF EVERY AMERICAN AND FICKLE HANDEDLY FROG CONTINUED MAYHEM, MURDER AND DESTRUCTION. THE WORLD NEIGHBORHOODS AND
STREETS.
[CHEERING] ON THIS DAY, WE START THE BEGINNING OF A NEW AMERICAN CENTURY, A TIME THAT WE TURN OUR HEADS FORWARD WITH PERSISTENT
AND RELENTLESS VOCUS ON PROTECTING OUR COMMUNITIES, OUR FAMILIES AND OUR COUNTRY. WITH OUR FEET FIRMLY PLANTED ON THE GROUND AND BY HOLDING INDIVIDUALS ACCOUNTABLE FOR
THEIR ACTIONS MUTUALLY -- EQUALLY AND FAIRLY. OUR NEW AMERICAN CENTURY DOES NOT RISK ITS FUTURE ON POLITICAL CORRECTNESS AND SENSELESS
HYPERBOLE.
[CHEERING] EXACTLY.
[CHEERING] IT IS ABOUT THIS COUNTRY. THE TIME IS NOW. TO RECOGNIZE OUR OBLIGATION THAT
WE HAVE TO LEAD THE WORLD WITH
UNWAVERING INTEGRITY. RENEWED STRENGTH, UNAPOLOGETIC RESOLVE AND WITH DONALD TRUMP IN THE WHITE HOUSE, WE WILL MAKE
AMERICA GREAT AGAIN.
[CHEERING] AMERICA TRADITIONAL AND UNDISPUTED ROLE AS WORLD LEADER IS IN JEOPARDY. THE OBAMA-CLINTON DUO HAS FAILED OUR COUNTRY BY DEFYING AMERICA'S EXCEPTIONALISM AND BETRAYING OUR NATIONS HISTORY AND OUR FOUNDING FATHERS REVOLUTIONARIES. THAT ESTABLISHED AMERICA ON THE
PRINCIPLES OF FREEDOM AND DEMOCRACY. AMERICAN EXCEPTIONALISM WAS A CORE PRINCIPLE. THE UNITED STATES LED AND ONE OUR BATTLES UNDER THIS DOCTRINE,
WE LED THE ALLIES TO VICTORY IN
WORLD WAR II AGAINST NAZI GERMANY.
[CHEERING] GOD HELP US, THAT FIRED UP.
>> USA!
>> I LOVE IT. WE ARE THE FIRST COUNTRY TO PUT
A MAN ON THE MOON. WE ENDED THE COLD WAR. WE ENDED THE COLD WAR AND WE STOPPED COMMUNISM, WE STOPPED COMMUNISM'S QUEST FOR WORLD
DOMINATION.
[CHEERING] AS RONALD REAGAN SAID, AND I QUOTE, IF WE LOSE FREEDOM HERE, THERE IS NO PLACE TO ESCAPE TO. THIS IS THE LAST STAND ON EARTH.
[CHEERING] YOU GUYS ARE GREAT. A CENTERPIECE OF AMERICAN FOREIGN-POLICY WAS ONCE THE PROTECTION OF THE UNITED STATES AND ITS PEOPLE AND INTERESTS
AROUND THE WORLD. SADLY, UNDER CURRENT LEADERSHIP,
THAT IS NO LONGER THE CASE. THIS CANNOT STAND PERIOD.
[CHEERING] WE MUST RECOGNIZE THAT AMERICA HAS ENEMIES IN OUR HOMELAND AND
ABROAD. OUR MILITARY IS TO BE CAPABLE OF PROTECTING THE NATION BY FINDING AND CAPTURING OUR ENEMIES. THE PRESIDENT MUST HAVE TOOLS TO DEAL WITH ALL THREATS TO THIS COUNTRY AND MUST HAVE THE GUTS
TO PUT THEM INTO ACTION WHENEVER NECESSARY. NO BILL, NO BREAK.
[CHEERING] AND DONALD TRUMP IS THAT LEADER. AND I'M GOING TO SAY THAT AGAIN. DONALD TRUMP IS THAT LEADER.
[CHEERING] WE MUST REGAIN OUR ABILITY TO TRULY CRUSH OUR ENEMIES AND OUR SOLDIERS FROM OUR SOLDIERS DESERVE TO HEAR FROM THEIR LEADERS WITH CLARITY AND PRECISION, TOO OFTEN OUR TROOPS ARE DISTRACTED BY TRIVIAL MATTERS ABOUT WHAT WORDS TO USE, WHAT TERMINOLOGY IS PUTTING THE CORRECT AND WHAT AFTER DOORS OPEN UP. MY GOD, OR IS NOT ABOUT
BATHROOMS. IT IS NOT ABOUT POLITICAL CORRECTNESS OR WORDS THAT ARE
MEANINGLESS. WAR IS ABOUT WINNING. THERE IS NO SUBSTITUTE, THERE IS
NO SUCH THING AS A RUNNER-UP AND
THERE ARE NO CONSOLATION PRIZES. A COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF DOES NOT
DRAW RED LINES AND THEN RETREAT. AMERICA DOES NOT BACK DOWN FROM ANYONE OR ANYTHING. THAT IS EXACTLY RIGHT.
GET FIRED UP. IT IS ABOUT THIS COUNTRY. IT IS ABOUT OUR COUNTRY WE ARE
TIRED OF OBAMA'S EMPTY SPEECHES AND HIS MISGUIDED RHETORIC. THIS HAS CAUSED THE WORLD TO
HAVE NO RESPECT FOR AMERICA'S WORD NOR DOES IT APPEAR OUR
MIGHT. LET ME BE CLEAR, CAUGHT ON DISPLAYS OF ENTITY -- EMPATHY TOWARDS TERRORISTS IS NOT A STRATEGY FOR DEFEATING THESE MURDERERS AS OBAMA AND HILLARY CLINTON WOULD LIKE US TO BELIEVE
.
[CHEERING] AND RELEASING, LISTEN TO WHAT I
AM ABOUT TO SAY. RELEASING TERRORISTS WILL NOT END THIS WAR ON THE CONTRARY, IT
SIMPLY EMBOLDENS THE TERRORIST AND PROLONGS THE WAR, AND UNDER
BARACK OBAMA, WE HAVE NO STRATEGY TO PROTECT THE CITIZENS
BEAT UNDER HILLARY CLINTON, IT
WILL BE MORE OF THE SAME. I AM INFURIATED WHEN I SAY THAT OUR PRESIDENT BANS KURDISTAN OF
OUR ENEMIES. I'M CERTAIN THAT WE CANNOT WIN THIS WAR UNLESS WE ARE FREE TO
CALL OUR ENEMIES BY NAME RADICAL ISLAMIST AND FILLED TYRANTS.
-- FAILED TYRANTS.
[CHEERING] BECAUSE OF OBAMA'S ILL-ADVISED ACTIONS, THE WORLD HAS LOST
FAITH IN AMERICAN LEADERSHIP IN
THE THREATS ARE MOUNTING. RADICAL ISLAM MUST ASSESS SIZING
AROUND THE WORLD, A COMPLETE
LACK OF AMERICAN MILITARY RADISHES AND -- READINESS TO
FACE MULTIPLE FRONTS. UNTOLD CYBER THREATS. DEMORALIZED ALLIES AROUND THE
WORLD. A STRUGGLING UNITED STATES
ECONOMY UNABLE TO COMPETE WITH A
BURGEONING CHINESE ECONOMY. GROWING NUCLEAR CAPABILITY IS A
CHINA, RUSSIA AND NORTH KOREA
AND LOSS OF RESPECT AND
CONFIDENCE AROUND THE GLOBE WE HAD BECOME THE BEST ENEMIES AND
WORST FRIENDS.
I'M GOING TO SAY THAT AGAIN WE
HAVE BECOME THE BEST ENEMIES AND
THE WORST FRIENDS AND THAT HAS
TO CHANGE. THESE NEXT FOUR YEARS, THESE
NEXT FOUR YEARS WILL BE CONSUMED I THAT PERILS THAT WE NOW FACE. AND THE SO-CALLED RED LINES OF
-- OR RESET BUTTONS WERE UNDER FAIR LAWYERS.
-- BILL YEARS.
THE OBAMA-CLINTON FAILED POLICY
LIST GOES ON AND ON. WE NEED A COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF WHO
UNDERSTANDS THE CHALLENGES AND
IS WILLING TO DO WHATEVER IT
TAKES TO MEET THEM HEAD ON. OUR ADVERSARIES MUST NEVER AGAIN MOCK AMERICAN WILL POWER AND WE MUST NEVER GIVE THEM A REASON TO
DOUBT OUR RESULT TO WIN.
-- RESOLVE TO WIN.
[CHEERING] THE MOST DAMAGING EXAMPLE, THE
MOST DAMAGING EXAMPLE OF THE PRESIDENT'S FAILURE TO
UNDERSTAND THE CONSEQUENCES OF PUTTING POLITICAL EXPEDIENCY AHEAD OF NATIONAL SECURITY IS
THE EMERGENCE OF CRISIS.
-- ISIS. WE CANNOT CONTINUE DOWN THIS PATH.
MORE LIVES ARE AT STAKE. OUR VERY LIFE, OUR WAY OF LIFE
IS IN JEOPARDY. OUR VERY EXISTENCE IS
THREATENED. WHAT KEEPS ME UP AT NIGHT IS THE SOBERING REALIZATION THAT EVIL EXISTS, THE RADICALIZATION OF ISLAM AND ITS BARBARIC CAUSE
THAT USES MODERNITY TO INFLUENCE
POTENTIALLY MILLIONS OF PEOPLE
AROUND THE WORLD TO JOIN THEIR CAUSE, IT SHOULD KEEP US ALL UP AT NIGHT. WE MUST TAKE SERIOUSLY THE POSSIBILITY THAT THESE ENEMIES
HAVE WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION
AND INTEND TO USE THEM. THAT IS A VERY SERIOUS ISSUE. WE MUST UNDERSTAND AND DEFINE OUR ENEMIES IF WE INTEND TO GET BEAT THEM -- DEFEAT THEM. AMERICANS DESERVE NO LESS. BECAUSE OBAMA CHOSE TO CONCEAL,
BECAUSE OF OBAMA CHOSE TO
CONCEAL THE ACTIONS OF TERRORISTS LIKE OSAMA BIN LADEN
AND GROUPS LIKE ISIS AND THE ROW OF IRAN AND RADICAL ISLAM, AMERICANS ARE AT A LOSS TO FULLY UNDERSTAND THE ENORMOUS THREAT
THEY POSE AGAINST US. NOW IS THE TIME FOR A LEADER
THAT IS HONEST AND STRONG. A LEADER WHO WILL STAND UP FOR AMERICA AND MAKE ABSOLUTELY CLEAR THAT IF YOU CROSS HER PATH
, YOU WILL PAY THE PRICE.
[CHEERING] WE DO NOT NEED A WEEK, SPINELESS PRESIDENT WHO IS MORE CONCERNED ABOUT ISSUING APOLOGIES THERE
PROTECTING AMERICANS.
-- DAN PROTECTING -- THAN
PROTECTING AMERICANS.
WE DO NOT NEED A RECKLESS
PRESIDENT WHO BELIEVES SHE IS
ABOVE THE LAW.
[CHEERING]
>> LOCK HER UP! LOCK HER UP!
>> LOCK HER UP, THAT IS RIGHT. THAT'S RIGHT.
LOCK HER UP. I'M GOOD TO TELL YOU WHAT, IT IS UNBELIEVABLE -- GOING TO TELL
YOU, IT IS UNBELIEVABLE.
>> LOCK HER UP!
>> I USE #NEVERHILLARY. THAT'S WHAT I USE. I HAVE CALLED ON HILLARY CLINTON
, I HAVE CALLED ON HILLARY CLINTON TO DROP OUT OF THE RACE BECAUSE SHE PUT OUR NATION'S SECURITY AT EXTREMELY HIGH RISK
WITH HER CARELESS USE OF A
PRIVATE E-MAIL SERVER.
[CHEERING] LOCK HER UP. YOU GUYS ARE GOOD. DAMN RIGHT.
>> LOCK HER UP! LOCK HER UP!
>> AND YOU KNOW WHY? YOU KNOW WHY WE ARE SAYING THAT?
WE ARE SAYING THAT BECAUSE IF I,
A GUY WHO KNOWS HIS BUSINESS, IF
I DID A 10TH OF WHAT SHE DID, I
WOULD BE IN JAIL TODAY.
>> LOCK HER UP!
>> SO, CROOKED HILLARY CLINTON,
LEAVE THIS RACE NOW.
[CHEERING] SHE NEEDS TO GO. BEFORE I END, I WILL REPEAT MY BELIEF THAT AMERICAN
EXCEPTIONALISM IS VERY REAL. LET US NOT FEAR WHAT WE KNOW TO BE TRUE. LET US NOT FEAR WHAT WE KNOW TO BE TRUE. INSTEAD, WE SHOULD ALWAYS REMEMBER THAT OUR COUNTRY, OUR COUNTRY WAS BUILT UPON JUDEO-CHRISTIAN VALUES AND
PRINCIPLES. AND INSTEAD, LET US REMEMBER THE SACRIFICES OF THOSE WHO HAVE
GONE BEFORE US. AMERICA IS UNIQUE AMERICA IS THE
GREATEST COUNTRY IN THE HISTORY
OF THE WORLD. SO GET READY, AMERICA. GET READY. NOW IS THE TIME TO ELECT FRESH,
BOLD LEADERSHIP. TRUMP, TRUMP, TRUMP.
LET'S GO.
GET IT GOING.
[CHEERING] WE ARE JUST BEGINNING.
[CHEERING] I PROMISE YOU, I PROMISE YOU
THAT DONALD TRUMP KNOWS THAT THE
PRIMARY ROLE OF THE PRESIDENT IS
TO KEEP US SAFE. HE RECOGNIZES THE THREATS WE FACE AND IS NOT AFRAID TO CALL THEM WHAT THEY ARE.
DONALD TRUMP LEADERSHIP, DECISION-MAKING, PROBLEM-SOLVING ABILITIES WILL RESTORE AMERICA'S ROLE AS THE UNDENIABLE AND
UNQUESTIONED WORLD LEADER.
[CHEERING] HE WILL LEAD TO FROM THE FRONT,
NOT FROM BEHIND. HE WILL LEAD WITH COURAGE. NEVER VACILLATING WHEN FACING
OUR ENEMIES OUR COMPETITORS. AND HE KNOWS THAT THE ADVANTAGE, DONALD TRUMP KNOWS THAT THE
ADVANTAGE IN LIFE, BUSINESS, AND WARTIME GOES TO THE COMPETITOR THAT DOES NOT POINT AND DOES NOT
BROADCAST HIS GAME PLAN.
[CHEERING] DONALD TRUMP WILL EXECUTE THE
FUNDAMENTAL TENANT OF PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH AND THERE WILL BE NO APOLOGIES FOR OUR AMERICAN EXCEPTIONALISM OR LEADERSHIP
STANDING AROUND THE WORLD. ONCE AGAIN, WAKE UP AMERICA. YOU CANNOT SIT THIS ONE OUT. YOU CANNOT SIT THIS ELECTION
OUT. GET OUT OF YOUR HOUSES AND GET
OUT THERE AND VOTE. INSTEAD, LIKE DONALD TRUMP AS
THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED
STATES OF AMERICA. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND GOD BLESS AMERICA!
