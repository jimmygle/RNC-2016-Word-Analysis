<strong>Brock Mealer</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> CHRISTMAS EVE, 2007. MY PARENTS, MY YOUNGER BROTHER,
HIS GIRLFRIEND, WE WERE DRIVING TO CHURCH. A CAR RAN A STOP SIGN AND
CRASHED INTO US. MY FATHER,<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> MY HERO, AND HOLLIS
DIED THAT NIGHT. I ENTERED A .5 HOURS OF SURGERY. WHEN I AWOKE, THE SURGEON CAME INTO MY ROOM WITH MORE DEVASTATING NEWS, MY SPINAL CORD DAMAGE WAS ABOUT THE WORST TEAM EVER SEEN AND I WOULD
LIKELY NEVER WALK AGAIN.
EVEN A 1% CHANCE WAS OVERLY
OPTIMISTIC. BUT THE 1% WAS ONLY NEEDED.
THROUGH IT ALL, I HAVE FAITH IN
JESUS CHRIST.
[CHEERING] I BELIEVED IN MYSELF AND TRY TO MAKE THAT 1% A REALITY. TRUTHFULLY, GOD MADE THAT 1% A
REALITY. HIS WELL, NOT MINE.
[CHEERING] HE BLESSED ME WITH FOOTBALL COACHES, GAVE ME A FIGHTING
CHANCE. BLESSED -- HIS BLESSING AND THEY WILL NEED FROM THE OHIO STATE
UNIVERSITY!
[CHEERING] AND I WENT ON TO BE CHEERED BY
UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN FANS AS A
LEAD THE WOLVERINES ONTO THE
FIELD.
[CHEERING] HE BLESSED ME WITH MY BEAUTIFUL
WIFE. WE WALKED ON THE AISLE TOGETHER. HE GAVE ME WAS OF THE BLESSINGS.
THIS VERY MOMENT IS A TESTAMENT TO GOD WORK IN ALL THINGS FOR
THE GOOD.
-- WORKING ALL THINGS FOR THE
GOOD.
[CHEERING] GUESS WHO ELSE WAS TOLD HE HAD A
1% CHANCE? A COMPANY THAT ANALYZES POLLING DATA FOR CNN PREDICTED LAST YEAR
THAT DONALD TRUMP HAD A 1%
CHANCE OF WINNING THE REPUBLICAN NOMINATION FOR PRESIDENT.
[CHEERING] MR. TRUMP, WELCOME TO THE CLUB. I DEFIED THE ODDS BUT I CANNOT
DO IT ON MY OWN.
DONALD TRUMP CAN DO IT ALONE
EITHER. HE NEEDS OUR HELP AND SUPPORT. JUST AS MICHIGAN WAS WILLING TO ADOPT A BUCKEYE FOR A CAUSE
GREATER THAN OURSELVES, WE CAN
UNITE BEHIND DONALD TRUMP TO
MAKE AMERICA ONE AGAIN.
[CHEERING] NOW, I WANT TO TURN IT OVER TO IT FELL OHIO STATE GRADUATE WHO
REALLY KNOWS HOW TO UNITE A TEAM
, COACH BOBBY KNIGHT.
