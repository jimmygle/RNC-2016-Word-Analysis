<strong>Roger Wicker</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> SEN. WICKER: GOOD AFTERNOON. IT'S AN HONOR TO BE HERE AS RNC
CHAIRMAN AND IT'S ALSO AN HONOR
TO BE HERE AS A DELEGATE FROM
THE GREAT STATE OF MISSISSIPPI.
[APPLAUSE]<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> YOU KNOW, THERE IS A REASON THAT
"MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN" HAS RESONATED WITH SO MANY PEOPLE. IT'S DIFFICULT TO SEE GREATNESS
WHEN YOU ARE WORKING HARDER FOR LESS.
IT'S DIFFICULT TO SEE GREATNESS
WHEN WASHINGTON NEWS PICKING WINNERS AND LOSERS.
IT'S DIFFICULT TO SEE GREATNESS
WHEN YOU FEEL YOUR VOICE ISN'T BEING HEARD.
FOR THE PAST EIGHT YEARS, WE HAVE WITNESSED THE ECONOMY'S LETTER AND STALL -- ECONOMY SPUTTER AND STALL. WE'VE SEEN THE PRESIDENT IGNORE
THE CONSTITUTION AND WE WATCHED
INSTABILITY FESTER AROUND THE WORLD. AMERICANS DESERVE TO SEE
GREATNESS AGAIN BECAUSE WE LIVE
IN THE GREATEST NATION THE WORLD
HAS EVER KNOWN.
[APPLAUSE] OUR NOMINEE, DONALD TRUMP,
BELIEVES WE CAN DO BETTER, THAT
AMERICANS CAN DO BETTER. HILLARY CLINTON OFFERS FOUR MORE
YEARS OF THE SAME FAILED AND
TIRED POLICIES THAT VOTERS REJECTED WHEN REPUBLICANS WON
THE SENATE MAJORITY IN 2014. HILLARY CLINTON ALSO BRINGS WITH HER A DANGEROUS RECORD ON NATIONAL SECURITY AND A LIFETIME OF SCANDALS AND LIES.
WE KNOW WHAT DOESN'T WORK, AND
WE DON'T NEED TO REPEAT IT.
WE CAN'T AFFORD TO REPEAT IT. THE REPUBLICAN PARTY RECOGNIZES
THAT EARNING ABOUT COMES WITH
-- EARNING A VOTE COMES WITH A PROFOUND RESPONSIBILITY AND
TRUST.
WHEN WE DOVE YOU AND THE SENATE
MAJORITY, WE WENT TO WORK --
WHEN WE WON THE SENATE MAJORITY, WE WENT TO WORK.
IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF THIS
YEAR, 31 SENATE BILLS HAVE BEEN
SIGNED INTO LAW. THE LAST TIME THAT HAPPENED WAS
1990. AS CHAIRMAN OF THE NATIONAL REPUBLICAN SENATORIAL COMMITTEE,
I HAVE SPENT THE LAST YEAR AND A HALF WORKING WITH OUR GREAT TEAM
TO PRESERVE THE REPUBLICAN
MAJORITY IN THE SENATE.
WE ARE RUNNING THE STRONGEST, SHARPEST SENATE CAMPAIGNS IN HISTORY, FROM ENGAGEMENT ON
SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS, WHICH
THE DEMOCRATS ARE IGNORING, TO
OUR SOPHISTICATED GROUND GAME IN EVERY STATE, OUR CAMPAIGNS WILL
HAVE THE RESOURCES THEY NEED TO
WIN IN NOVEMBER. OUR MESSAGE TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE BETWEEN NOW AND ELECTION DAY IS SIMPLE.
WE ARE WORKING FOR YOU. WE HAVE A RECORD OF ACHIEVEMENT
TO SHOW FOR IT.
UNDER REPUBLICAN LEADERSHIP, WE HAVE KEPT STRONGER DEFENSE, SAFER HIGHWAYS, SAFER SKIES, AND
BETTER ENERGY POLICIES FOR A BETTER ECONOMY. BECAUSE OF SENATORS LIKE ROB
PORTMAN AND KELLY AYOTTE, WE HAVE ADDRESSED NATIONAL CRISES
LIKE OPIOID ADDICTION. BECAUSE OF SENATORS LIKE ROY BLUNT AND MARCO RUBIO, WE ARE
TAKING ACTION AGAINST SERIOUS PUBLIC HEALTH THREATS LIKE THE GOT -- LIKE ZIKA. BECAUSE OF SENATORS LIKE MARK KIRK AND JOHNNY ISAKSON, WE ARE
PROVIDING BETTER CARE AND
BENEFITS FROM OUR -- FOR OUR VETERANS.
BECAUSE OF SENATORS LIKE PAT
TOOMEY, WE ARE ENSURING WE HAVE
THE RIGHT POLICIES IN PLACE TO FIGHT CRIME. AND BECAUSE OF SENATORS LIKE RON
JOHNSON AND JOHN MCCAIN, WE ARE
PUSHING BACK AGAINST THE FAILED FOREIGN POLICY OF THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION. SENATE REPUBLICANS HAVE
RESPONDED TO INTERNATIONAL THREATS FROM ROGUE STATES LIKE NORTH KOREA TO INCREASINGLY
SOPHISTICATED CYBER ATTACKS.
WE HAVE WORKED TO PROTECT
VICTIMS OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING. WE HAVE ACTUALLY CUT DISCRETIONARY PENDING --
SPENDING, PUT TOGETHER A BUDGET THAT BALANCES IN 10 YEARS, AND
SUCCEEDED IN ACHIEVING LONG-TERM TAX RELIEF FOR THE MIDDLE CLASS. WE PASSED THE FIRST REPEAL OF OBAMACARE. OF COURSE, THE PRESIDENT VETOED THAT BILL, BUT WE KEPT A PROMISE
AND DESIGNED A BLUEPRINT TO SHOW HOW REPEALING AND REPLACING OBAMACARE CAN AND WILL BE DONE. WE DON'T ALWAYS FIND AGREEMENT
IN A DIVIDED GOVERNMENT, BUT WE
HAVE REFUSED TO SETTLE FOR
GRIDLOCK. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE DESERVE BETTER THAN THAT AND WE HAVE
MORE WORK TO DO. MY FELLOW AMERICANS, THE STAKES OF THIS ELECTION ARE HIGH. WHEN DONALD TRUMP IS ELECTED
PRESIDENT, HE WILL DETERMINE THE
FUTURE OF THE SUPREME COURT AND
HE WILL LEAD OUR TROOPS AS
COMMANDER IN CHIEF.
HE WILL SHEPHERD ECONOMIC POLICIES THAT DIRECTLY IMPACT AMERICAN JOBS AND LIVELIHOODS
AND FAMILIES. HE AND VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE WILL NEED A REPUBLICAN SENATE TO
GET THAT JOB DONE. REPUBLICAN SENATORS HAVE WHAT
OUR NATION NEEDS AT THIS CRITICAL MOMENT. WE HAVE WHAT PRESIDENT TRUMP
WILL NEED. AND WE WILL SUCCEED IN NOVEMBER.
[APPLAUSE] AND NOW, IT IS WITH GREAT PLEASURE THAT I INTRODUCE OUR NEXT SPEAKER. HE COMES TO US TODAY FROM DODGE
CITY, IN THE GREAT STATE OF KANSAS, SENATOR PAT ROBERTS,
ATTESTED, TRUSTED, AND TRUE
CONSERVATIVE, WHO BRINGS PRACTICAL MIDWESTERN VALUES TO WASHINGTON. AS A POWERFUL AND EFFECTIVE
LEADER, SENATOR PAT ROBERTS CHAIRED THE AGRICULTURAL
COMMITTEE. HE WORKS TO CUT RUNAWAY SPENDING
BY GOVERNMENT OVERREACH AND
PROTECT OUR FREEDOMS. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, PLEASE
JOIN ME IN GIVING A WARM REPUBLICAN WELCOME TO SENATOR PAT ROBERTS OF KANSAS!

<strong>Pat Roberts</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> SEN,.. ROBERTS: HELLO, KANSAS. I'M PAT ROBERTS. AND I'M PROUD TO REPRESENT THE
PEOPLE OF KANSAS IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE, AND I'M GLAD TO
BE IN OHIO,<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> A SPECIAL PLACE FOR MY FAMILY'S HISTORY. IT WAS HERE 160 YEARS AGO THAT MY GREAT-GRANDFATHER, JOHN
WESLEY ROBERTS, AND OHIO NEWSPAPER EDITORS STOOD ON THE BANKS OF THE OHIO RIVER AND LOOKED SOUTH TO A NATION, A
NATION IN TURMOIL. JOHN WESLEY HAD LITTLE PATIENCE
FOR THINGS AS THEY WERE. HE SHIPPED A FLATBED TO KANSAS, WHERE HE BECAME A FIGHTER FOR
ABOLITION AND FREEDOM WITHIN OUR NEWLY-BORN REPUBLICAN PARTY. HE WOULD KNOW FEAR. HE WOULD LIVE WITH VIOLENCE. BUT AS A FRONTIER EDITOR, HE
SPOKE TO THE TRUTH AND HEALTH
KANSAS -- AND HELPED KANSAS MAKE
A FREE STATE. JOHN WESLEY HAD A VISION OF WHAT
AMERICA SHOULD, COULD BE, WITH THE YOUNG NATION ON THE EDGE OF CHAOS.
HE HAD THE TEMERITY TO LOOK TO A BETTER FUTURE AND A FIGHT FOR
FREEDOM -- AND TO FIGHT FOR FREEDOM.
TODAY, WE, TOO, ARE LIVING IN A
TIME OF GREAT SELF-DOUBT.
WE ARE LIVING IN A TIME WITH
LEADERS WHO HAVE LITTLE PATIENCE
FOR THINGS JUST AS THEY ARE. HILLARY CLINTON AND THE
DEMOCRATS HAVE CHANGED OUR
GOVERNMENT.
THEY HAVE TAXED US. THEY HAVE REGULATED US. THEY HAVE DESTROYED OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. THEY HAVE STUNNED OUR ECONOMY AND KILLED NEW JOBS. THEY HAVE MADE OUR WORLD AND OUR COUNTRY LESS SAFE. AS THE SENIOR MARINE IN THE CONGRESS, I BELIEVE THAT HILLARY
CLINTON FAILED TO PROTECT
AMERICAN LIVES IN BENGHAZI.
[APPLAUSE] NOW, WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT
MAKE? WELL, TODAY, THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO SERVE OUR NATION IN HARM'S WAY DO NOT FEEL THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT HAS THEIR
BACK. HILLARY CLINTON HAS REPEATEDLY SIDESTEPPED THE TRUTH AND WILL
DO IT AGAIN. ARE WE REALLY READY TO ACCEPT A DIFFERENT STANDARD FOR THE ELITES THAN FOR THE REST OF US? BUT THAT DECISION WILL NO LONGER BE MADE BY A CONFUSED FBI OR THE ADMINISTRATION'S DEPARTMENT OF
JUSTICE. IT WILL BE UP TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. IT WILL BE UP TO US IN
NOVEMBER. IN KANSAS, AS MANY STATES THROUGHOUT AMERICA, OUR RURAL
WAY OF LIFE AND OUR FAMILY
VALUES ARE UNDER ATTACK BY AN OVERZEALOUS FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. NO ONE KNOWS THAT BETTER THAN
FARMERS AND RANCHERS AND
GROWERS. THE OBAMA-CLINTON ADMINISTRATION HAS MADE THEIR JOB NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE WITH REGULATION. THEY ACTUALLY FEEL RULED, NOT GOVERNED. WE NEED A CHAMPION FOR RURAL AND SMALL-TOWN AMERICA WHO WILL LIFT
THE YOKE OF REGULATION, AND WE HAVE ONE, VICE PRESIDENT MIKE
PENCE.
[APPLAUSE] AND I'M SO GLAD THAT OUR NEXT
PRESIDENT SHOWED GREAT JUDGMENT IN THIS ELECTION -- SELECTION. SO, TODAY, WE, TOO, ARE JUST LIKE MY GREAT-GRANDFATHER STANDING HERE IN OHIO, LOOKING
AT OUR NATION, FEARFUL ABOUT
WHAT WE SEE. FOR YEARS, THE DEMOCRATS PARTY'S PRIMARY OBJECTIVE GOAL -- TO
OBTAIN POWER -- HAS BEEN SOMETHING CALLED "IDENTITY POLITICS," DIVIDING THE AMERICAN
PEOPLE BY RACE, BY GENDER, BY
AGE, AND NOW EVEN SEX, LEADING
TO MORE DIVISIVENESS AND
FRIGHTENING LAWLESSNESS
TARGETING OUR NATION'S POLICE.
ENOUGH OF THE IDENTITY POLITICS.
WE ARE ALL AMERICANS. LET US EMBRACE THAT BASIC
PREMISE. LET'S MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN! WE IN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY NEED A LEADER WITH VISION WHO SEES A BETTER FUTURE. WE NEED A PRESIDENT WHO WILL
RESTORE OUR ECONOMY AND OUR SECURITY.
AND WE NEED A LEADER WHO WILL RESPECT THE CONSTITUTION OF THE
UNITED STATES. WE NEED SOMEONE WHO WILL GET THE JOB DONE.
WE NEED A BUILDER AND A DOER.
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WE NEED DONALD TRUMP AND WE NEED A
REPUBLICAN SENATE AND HOUSE TO
BACK HIM UP. IN ESSENCE, WE NEED YOUR HELP TO
TAKE OUR COUNTRY BACK, EACH AND
EVERY ONE OF YOU.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
[APPLAUSE]
