<strong>Jeff Sessions</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> JEFF SESSIONS: THANK YOU. THANK YOU, ALABAMA. SPEAKING FROM THIS PODIUM TODAY
IS A LONG WAY FROM THE RAFTERS SEAT MY WIFE AND I HAD IN MIAMI
IN 1972.<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> THIS YEAR ARE VOTERS SPOKE
CLEARLY ON TWO CRITICAL ISSUES IN OUR PRIMARY.
TRADE AND IMMIGRATION. THEY AFFIRMED DONALD TRUMP'S POSITION. THEY OPPOSED OBAMA ON TRADE. THEY DEMANDED A LAWFUL SYSTEM OF
IMMIGRATION THAT PROTECTS THEIR SAFETY AND THEIR FINANCIAL
WELL-BEING. AVERAGE AMERICANS HAVE BEEN THE FIRST TO KNOW THAT SOMETHING IS WRONG WITH THIS ECONOMY. OUR MIDDLE CLASS IS STEADILY DECLINING. AFRICAN-AMERICAN AND HISPANIC
COMMUNITIES HAVE BEEN HURT THE
MOST.
THE WASHINGTON ESTABLISHMENT AND
THE MEDIA AND BIG CORPORATIONS
HAVE BEEN IN DENIAL. FELLOW REPUBLICANS, WE MUST UNDERSTAND THAT THE INCOMES OF
MIDDLE-CLASS AMERICANS TODAY ARE
$4000 LESS PER YEAR THAN IN
1999. THIS IS AN ECONOMIC DISASTER. WE ARE ON THE WRONG TRACK. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE KNOW IT.
[APPLAUSE] HILLARY CLINTON HAS A PLAN FOR MORE OF THE SAME. MORE GOVERNMENT AND MORE TAXES
AND MORE REGULATIONS AND MORE AT ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION AND MORE
DEBT. SHE HAS BEEN THE CHAMPION OF
GLOBALIST TRADE AGREEMENTS. BUT THEY HAVE NOT WORKED FOR THE
AMERICAN PEOPLE. WHEN THOSE AGREEMENTS WERE
SIGNED PRESIDENT CLINTON AND OBAMA PROMISED ARE DANGEROUS TRADE DEFICITS WITH CHINA AND
KOREA WOULD BE REDUCED. THE DEFICIT WITH CHINA HAS INCREASED FIVEFOLD. THE DEFICIT WITH KOREA HAS MORE THAN DOUBLED IN LESS THAN FOUR
YEARS.
THESE ARE JOB KILLING NUMBERS.
THEY ARE NOW PUSHING A DISASTROUS OBAMA TRADE AGREEMENT
, THE TRANSPACIFIC PARTNERSHIP
AGREEMENT. THIS MUST NOT HAPPEN. THIS ELECTION HAS ALSO BEEN
ABOUT IMMIGRATION. FOR 30 YEARS ARE GOOD AND DECENT PEOPLE HAVE PLEADED WITH THEIR LEADERS FOR SOUND IMMIGRATION
POLICY. A POLICY THAT WOULD ADVANCE THE
NATIONAL INTEREST. OUR ELITES HAVE RESPONDED WITH DISDAIN AND TO AND SCORN. IS THERE ANYONE IN AMERICA THAT
IS NOT UNDERSTAND THAT WHEN WE BRING IN MORE WORKERS THAN WE HAD JOBS, THE JOB PROSPECTS AND WAGES FALL.
[APPLAUSE] TOP ECONOMISTS AND THE
CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE OF TOLD US JUST THAT.
IS IT TOO MUCH TO ASK THAT WE SLOW DOWN AND PROTECT OUR NATIONAL SECURITY AND JOBS? WE LAWFULLY

THEY ARE FOR THE MOST PART
WONDERFUL NEW ADDITIONS TO OUR
COUNTRY.
[CHEERING] AND ON TOP OF THAT, WE HAVE 700,000 GUESTWORKERS HERE WHO TAKE JOBS IN THE MAJORITY OF
THESE ARE NOT SEASONAL OR AGRICULTURE WORKERS, THEY ARE
ABOUT 350,000 PEOPLE WHO SUCCEED
IN CROSSING OUR BORDERS ILLEGALLY EACH YEAR AND ALMOST 500,000 MORE UNLAWFULLY OVERSTAY
THEIR VISAS. THESE ARE EXTREME NUMBERS. BUT THE ONLY SOLUTION FROM OBAMA
AND HILLARY CLINTON IS TO CAPITULATE TO THE LAWLESSNESS
AND GIVE AMNESTY AND CITIZENSHIP TO ALL. IT WILL NOT WORK.
>> BOO! UNDERSTAND THIS, FROM 2000-2014, WHILE OUR EXISTING POPULATION INCREASED BY A MILLION, THE NUMBER OF JOBS HELD BY AMERICANS ACTUALLY DECLINED. AMAZINGLY ALL THE NET JOB GROWTH AND THAT TIME WENT TO
IMMIGRANTS. COMBINE THAT WITH THE REALITY OF EFFICIENT BUSINESSES AND INCREASED AUTOMATION AND SLOW GROWTH, THE FACT IS WE JUST
DON'T HAVE ENOUGH JOBS BEING CREATED NOW FOR THE PEOPLE WHO
ARE HERE. DOES THIS HELP TO EXPLAIN WHY
OUR WAGES HAVE FALLEN AND BY WE
HAVE THE FALSE -- LOWEST
PERCENTAGE OF AMERICANS ACTUALLY
HOLDING A JOB IN 40 YEARS? OUR DUTY AS ELECTED OFFICIALS IS
TO GET OUR PEOPLE JOBS FIRST.
IT CANNOT BE OUR POLICY TO TAKE
JOBS FROM ACROSS -- A ROCKWELL GOVERNMENT SUPPORT HIM AS ARE
USE FOR THOSE UNEMPLOYED
AMERICANS. BAD TRADE DEALS.
EXCESS IMMIGRATION. THE LABOR MARKET, JOB PROSPECTS. IMPROPER VETTING PLACES OUR
NATION AT RISK OF TERRORISM. REMEMBER, THE PRESIDENT HAS THE CLEAR POWER TO SUSPEND IMMIGRATION TO PROTECT AMERICA. AMERICA WANTS HELP NOW.
[CHEERING] THIS ELECTION WILL MAKE IT
HAPPEN.
[CHEERING] THAT IS WHY WE NEED DONALD TRUMP
.
[CHEERING] DONALD TRUMP IS THE LEADER WHO
WILL BRING CHANGE.
[CHEERING] HE HAS THE STRENGTH, THE
COURAGE, AND THE WILL TO GET IT
DONE. HE IS ATTRACTING MORE AND MORE INDEPENDENTS AND DEMOCRATS IN
THE MOVEMENT. DONALD TRUMP WILL KILL OBAMA TRADE.
[CHEERING] DONALD TRUMP WILL BUILD THE
WALL.
[CHEERING] AND DONALD TRUMP WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN.
[CHEERING] THANK YOU. GOD BLESS.
