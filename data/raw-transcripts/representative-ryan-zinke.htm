<strong>Ryan Zinke</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> GOOD EVENING, CLEVELAND AND
THANK YOU FOR HOSTING. WHAT A NIGHT. MONTANA, YOU ARE IN THE HOUSE.
[CHEERING] I'M HONORED TO BE SHARING A STAGE SENATOR<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> ERNST AND JASON BEARDSLEY IN ALL THESE
DISTINGUISHED VETERANS. I ALSO PROBABLY REPRESENT THE
GREAT STATE OF MONTANA AND THE FIRST SEAL IN THE HOUSE OF
REPRESENTATIVES.
[CHEERING] BEFORE I WAS ELECTED TO
CONGRESS, I SPENT 23 YEARS AS A
NAVY SEAL. I WAS A COMMANDER OF SEAL TEAM
SIX.
[CHEERING] WHAT I'M MOST PROUD OF IS WHEN I
WAS GROWING UP, MY DAUGHTER WAS GROWING UP, I TOLD HER TO THINGS, DON'T JOIN THE NAVY AND
DON'T MARRY A NAVY SEAL. SHE IGNORED ME AND THE BOAT AND
I'M SO PROUD.
-- SHE DID BOTH AND I'M SO PROUD. HAVE YOU EVER HEARD A PLACE CALLED GITMO? I'M PERSONALLY ACQUAINTED WITH
MANY OF HIS INDIVIDUALS
EXPERIENCE IN THOSE
ACCOMMODATIONS. LET ME TELL YOU, THEY NEED TO
STAY THERE FOREVER.
[CHEERING] EVER HEAR OF CHRIS KYLE, ROB O'NEILL, GLENN DORNEY, MARCUS LUTRELL? I'VE HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF
WORKING WITH THESE NINE TEAMMATES IN AMERICA AND I'VE
MENTORED MANY MORE WHOSE NAMES YOU WILL NEVER KNOW. AS A SEAL, THERE OTHER FACTORS THAT ACCOMPLISHED SUCCESS. THE FIRST IS TEAMWORK. YOU NEED TO KNOW WITHOUT A DOUBT
THE GUY BEHIND YOU LITERALLY HAS
YOUR BACK. SECONDLY, TRAINING. WE ONLY TO EVERY TROOP AND HARM'S WAY TO MEASURE THE HAVE
THE RIGHT EQUIPMENT, THE RIGHT TRAINING AND THE RULES OF
ENGAGEMENT TO WIN DECISIVELY IN
THE FIELD OF BATTLE. THEY DESERVE NO LESS.
[CHEERING] LASTLY, EVERY SEAL, SOLDIER, RING, AIRMEN, THOSE NEVER TO
QUIT. WITHOUT TEAMWORK, TRAINING AND
NEVER QUITTING SUCCESSFUL
MISSIONS, LIKE THE ONES THAT
KILLED OSAMA BIN LADEN ARE
IMPOSSIBLE. WHEN WE DON'T DO THINGS RIGHT DANGEROUS SITUATIONS, THAT
THINGS HAPPEN. IN JANUARY, ARMY GREEN BERET
LOST HIS LIFE IN AFGHANISTAN
WHEN HIS UNIT CAME UNDER HEAVY
TALIBAN FIRE.
COMMANDERS ON THE GROUND, THEY
REQUESTED AIR SUPPORT. THEY RECEIVED NOTHING. THIS TRAGEDY REPRESENTS THE
WEAKNESS WE HAVE COME TO EXPECT FROM ARMCHAIR QUARTERBACKS LIKE BARACK OBAMA AND HILLARY
CLINTON. SENATOR ERNST HALEY DESCRIBED THE LEADERSHIP FAILURES. BARACK OBAMA AND HILLARY CLINTON ARE BOTH RESPONSIBLE FOR THESE FAILURES.
[CHEERING] PRESIDENT OBAMA ACTUALLY CLINTON, BEING POPULAR IS MORE
IMPORTANT THAN BEING A
COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF. PRESIDENT OBAMA AND HILLARY CLINTON ABANDONED IRAQ. PRESIDENT OBAMA AND HILLARY CLINTON DREW A REDLINE IN SYRIA
AND THEN REFUSED TO UPHOLD IT. PRESIDENT OBAMA AND HILLARY
CLINTON WATCHED PASSIVELY AS
CHINA AND RUSSIA FILLED THE INTERNATIONAL LEADERSHIP VACUUM THAT THEY CREATED. PRESIDENT OBAMA REACHED A DANGEROUS NUCLEAR ARMS AGREEMENT WITH IRAN, A COUNTRY WHOSE PEOPLE AND LEADERS TWEET DEATH
TO AMERICA. HILLARY CLINTON REMAINED LARGELY
SILENT. OUR WORLD KNOWS THIS PRESIDENT
IS WEAK. HIS ANOINTED SUCCESSOR, THE ARCHITECT OF BENGHAZI IS NO
BETTER. TOGETHER, BARACK OBAMA AND HILLARY CLINTON HAVE BROUGHT US ISIS AND BROUGHT DOWN BENGHAZI. I SHUDDER TO THINK HOW MANY TIMES OUR FLAG WILL FLY AT HALF STAFF.
HILLARY CLINTON IS IN THE OVAL
OFFICE. I'VE BEEN TO A LOT OF FUNERALS.
AND TOO MANY FUNERALS. THESE ARE INEVITABLE IN WAR. BUT THE LIVES OF SERGEANT MCCLINTOCK AND THE FOUR AMERICANS AND BENGHAZI COULD
HAVE BEEN SAVED WITH LEADERSHIP
IN THE WHITE HOUSE. DONALD J TRUMP IS NOT AFRAID TO
TALK ABOUT RADICAL ISLAMIC
TERRORISM.
[CHEERING] I CAN GUARANTEE YOU, IF WE GO TO WAR, WE WILL GO TO WAR TO WIN.
[CHEERING] WE NEED A COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF WHO
WILL SUPPORT OUR TROOPS RATHER THAN ABANDON THEM AND BENGHAZI. WE NEED A MENTOR TO DOUBLE PUT
OUR VETERANS CONFRONT OF THE LINE RATHER THAN LETTING THEM
DIE WHILE WAITING FOR HEALTH
CARE.
[CHEERING] IT WE NEED A COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF
THAT WILL STAND WITH ISRAEL
RATHER THAN WITH A READING OCTAVES -- IRENE ROCKETS THAT -- IRANIAN ROCKETS THAT FIRE AT
ISRAEL. IT IS TIME TO RALLY THE TROOPS. TIME TO RALLY AROUND OUR
CANDIDATE. HOW TO RALLY AROUND DONALD TRUMP
WILL MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN.
[CHEERING] THANK YOU, GOD BLESS AMERICA,
GOOD NIGHT AND GOD BLESS ALL OF OUR TROOPS.
MEN AND WOMEN. MONTANA, I LOVE YOU.
[CHEERING]
