<strong>Joni Ernst</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> DISTINGUISHED DELEGATES, REPUBLICANS, AND MILLIONS OF MY FELLOW AMERICANS WATCHING AROUND THE COUNTRY, ESPECIALLY THOSE IN IOWA, THANK YOU. IT IS AN<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> HONOR TO BE WITH YOU IN CLEVELAND. AND TO BE ON THE STAGE WITH FELLOW VETERANS, AMONG THEM, OR SPECIAL OPERATIONS AFTER SERGEANT JASON VEERED -- BEAR DSLEY. AND NAVY SEAL AND CONGRESSMAN
RYAN ZINKE E. I NEVER WOULD HAVE IMAGINED A
FARM GIRL LIKE ME FROM MONTGOMERY COUNTY HAVE THE
OPPORTUNITY TO SERVE AS THE
FIRST WOMAN ELECTED TO FEDERAL OFFICE FROM IOWA. HOWEVER, MY PARENTS ALWAYS SAID TO MY BROTHER AND SISTER AND ME,
IF WE WORKED HARD ANYTHING WAS
POSSIBLE. GROWING UP WE DID NOT HAVE MUCH. BUT WHAT WE DID NOT HAVE AN MONEY, MY PARENTS PARTICULARLY MY MOTHER MADE UP FOR WITH
TENACITY. SHE REALLY ENCOURAGED US, HE
NEVER HEAR HER SAY NO. INSTEAD, IF SOMETHING WAS CHALLENGING, SHE WOULD SAY JONI,
WE WILL FIGURE OUT A WAY. IF THIS IS WHAT YOU WANT, LET'S
MAKE IT HAPPEN. WE WILL FIGURE IT OUT TOGETHER. THAT IS A TRAIT I CARRY WITH ME TODAY AND IT IS SOMETHING I
TEACH MY OWN DAUGHTER. IN OUR HOUSEHOLD, AND IN THE
HOMES OF MANY OF THOSE IN THE MILITARY, INCLUDING THOSE AT HERE TONIGHT, GIVING UP, QUITTING OR EXCEPTING FAILURE ARE NOT OPTIONS.
[CHEERING] THAT RESILIENCE IS NOT UNIQUE TO
OUR HOUSE. THAT CAN DO ATTITUDE HAS SERVED
AS THE FOUNDATION OF OUR COUNTRY
FOR 200 AND 40 YEARS. IT CONTINUES TONIGHT HERE IN OHIO, IOWA AND ALL AROUND OUR GREAT NATION. IN BETWEEN MY FRESHMAN AND
SOPHOMORE YEARS OF COLLEGE I
WENT ON AND AGRICULTURAL EXCHANGE TO THE SOVIET UNION. AT NIGHT, THE UKRAINIANS DO NOT TALK ABOUT FARMING, RATHER THEY
WANTED TO KNOW WHAT IT WAS LIKE TO LIVE IN A COUNTRY WHERE THEY COULD EXPERIENCE FREEDOM. THEY WANTED TO KNOW, YES
BEAUTIFUL FREEDOM. THEY WANTED TO KNOW ABOUT OUR
COUNTRY, A PLACE WHERE ANYTHING WAS POSSIBLE.
WHEN I CAME HOME, I REALIZED IT WAS NOT ENOUGH TO SIMPLY ENJOY FREEDOM AND LIBERTY. I HAD TO DO MY PART TO PROTECT AND PRESERVE IT. SO I JOINED THE MILITARY WHICH
IS TREMENDOUSLY IMPORTANT INSTITUTION THAT THE FENCE THE FREEDOM THAT AMERICANS CHERISH.
[CHEERING] THANK YOU. I HAD THE GREAT PRIVILEGE OF
SERVING MY STATE AND MY COUNTRY
WELL WORKING ALONGSIDE SOME OF
OUR NATION'S FINEST SOLDIERS. FOR 14 MONTHS I SERVED AS A COMPANY COMMANDER DURING OPERATION IRAQI FREEDOM WHERE MY
UNIT WAS TASKED WITH RUNNING CONVOYS ARE QUITE IN SOUTHERN
IRAQ. LAST NOVEMBER AFTER MORE THAN 23
YEARS OF SERVICE, I RETIRED AS A LIEUTENANT COLONEL IN THE IOWA
ARMY NATIONAL GUARD.
[CHEERING] AS I TRAVEL ACROSS IOWA AND
AROUND OUR GREAT COUNTRY, I HEAR FROM FOLKS WHO ARE WORRIED
AMERICA IS NO LONGER LEADING, BUT RATHER FOLLOWING FROM BEHIND. THOSE CONCERNS ARE ECHOED BY OUR ALLIES AROUND THE WORLD. AND RIGHTFULLY SO. THE QUESTION I HEAR TIME AND TIME AGAIN IS, WHERE IS AMERICA'S LEADERSHIP? THERE IS A VOID IN THE WORLD, A
DEFICIT THAT CANNOT BE FILLED BY OTHERS. OUR COUNTRY IN THE WORLD OF
WHICH WE ARE A PART SIMPLY CANNOT AFFORD FOUR MORE YEARS OF THIS LACK OF LEADERSHIP UNDER HILLARY CLINTON.
[CHEERING] OUR ALLIES SEE US SHRINKING FROM OUR PLACE AS A LEADER IN THE WORLD AS WE HAVE FAILED TIME AND TIME AGAIN TO ADDRESS THREATS. THEY ARE LOOKING FOR AMERICAN LEADERS, LEADERS WERE WILLING TO
STAND UP AND SAY ENOUGH IS ENOUGH.
[CHEERING] UNFORTUNATELY, HILLARY CLINTON
CANNOT BE TRUSTED.
HER JUDGMENT AND CHARACTER ARE NOT SUITED TO BE SITTING IN THE MOST POWERFUL OFFICE IN THE WORLD.
SHE HAS ALREADY FAILED US TOO
MANY TIMES BEFORE. HILLARY CLINTON HAS FAILED TO STOP THE EXPANSION OF TERRORISM. HER POLICIES IN LIBYA, AFGHANISTAN, IRAQ AND SYRIA HAVE CREATED MORE SAFE HAVENS FOR TERRORISM. SHOCKINGLY, SHE CONTINUES TO
SUPPORT A POLICY THAT BRINGS CAPTURED TERRORISTS INTO OUR BACKYARD. ALL DISAPPEARED BELIEVE THAT IS UNACCEPTABLE.
UNACCEPTABLE. JOIN CLINTON HAS GET TO SUPPORT
OUR ALLIES -- HILLARY CLINTON
HAS FAILED TO SUPPORT OUR
ALLIES.
HER DECISION TO BACK THE IRAN CLEAR DEAL PUTS IMPERIL OUR
LONGTIME FRIENDS AND ALLIES IN
THE REGION, ESPECIALLY ISRAEL.
THEY HAVE CONTINUED TO THREATEN
AND DESTROY ISRAEL BOTH DIRECTLY AND INDIRECTLY THROUGH ITS TERRORIST PROXIES SUCH AS HEZBOLLAH. THERE ARE MANY TOP SPONSOR OF TERRORISM WHICH ENDANGERS NOT
JUST ISRAEL, BUT EUROPE AND THE
UNITED STATES.
[CHEERING] AND LOOK, JUST TAKE A LOOK,
FOLKS. THAT'S PATHETIC TRACK RECORD SHE
AND OBAMA HAVE IN THE WAR ON
ISIS. THIS ADMINISTRATION HAS CALLED THEM JUNIOR VARSITY ADVERSARIES, IGNORING SOME OF THE BEST ADVICE THEY WERE GIVEN. THEY REPRESENT A THREAT THAT IS
NOT LIMITED TO THE MIDDLE EAST AND IS SPREADING RAPIDLY. IN FACT, ACCORDING TO THE FBI, ISIS IS PRESENT IN ALL 50 STATES. THINK ABOUT IT FOR A MOMENT. TERRORISTS FROM ISIS ARE IN
EVERY ONE OF OUR 50 STATES. IT WILL USE WHATEVER WEAPONS THEY HAVE, GUNS, TRUCKS, KNIVES, POISONS AND BOMBS. TO KILL INNOCENT PEOPLE. UNDER THIS CURRENT ADMINISTRATION, ISIS CONTINUES TO SPREAD WHILE THE PRESIDENT FAILED TO PUT FORWARD A COMPREHENSIVE STRATEGY TO DEFEAT
AND DESTROY THEM. DONALD TRUMP WILL NOT HESITATE TO CALL RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM BY ITS NAME. AND HE WILL NOT HESITATE TO DESTROY THOSE THAT WISH TO HARM
OUR GREAT NATION. USA. GOD BLESS YOU. HILLARY CLINTON HAS FAILED TO PROTECT OUR NATIONAL SECURITY. SHE JEOPARDIZED OUR SAFETY BY DECIDING OUR LAWS DON'T APPLY TO
HER. SETTING UP HER OWN PRIVATE E-MAIL SERVER AND THE LINE. LYING TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ABOUT HOW IT WAS USED.
>> BOO!
[LAUGHTER]
>> OUR MEN AND WOMEN OF THE
ARMED SERVICES, LET ME SAY THIS CLEARLY, OUR MEN AND WOMEN OF
THE ARMED SERVICES DO NOT FAIL US. THEY CANNOT FAIL US. THE VETERANS HERE WITH ME DID
NOT TELL US.
-- FAIL US.
[CHEERING] THEY DID NOT FAIL US. THEY TOO ARE INDIVIDUALS OF THE HIGHEST INTEGRITY. OUR PRESIDENT CANNOT FAIL US
EITHER. HOW CAN WE ACCEPT HILLARY CLINTON WHEN SHE HAS BAILED THEM TALK A FAILED US AND CANNOT BE
TRUSTED. SHE HAS PROVEN TIME AND TIME AGAIN THAT SHE IS ENTIRELY UNFIT TO SERVE AS OUR NATION'S COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF.
[CHEERING] FOR TOO LONG, AMERICANS HAVE FELT ABANDONED AND THEY ARE WARNING -- THEY ARE WARNING
UNHEARD. DONALD TRUMP HAS HEARD THESE VOICES LOUD AND CLEAR. WE CANNOT AFFORD FOUR MORE YEARS
OF THE SAME FAILED POLICIES.
[CHEERING] IF THAT IS NOT ENOUGH, THE
VETERANS ADMINISTRATION HAS BEEN FAILING THOSE WHO HAVE SERVED ALONGSIDE THOSE OF US HERE ON
THE STAGE WITH SCANDAL AFTER SCANDAL AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL.
IN FEAR CARE, LONG WAIT TIMES, EXTRAORDINARILY -- EXTRAORDINARY INEFFICIENCY AND BUREAUCRACY
THAT HAS GONE WILD STILL CONTINUES. WE NEED A COMMANDER IN CHIEF WHO WILL STAND UP TO OUR ENEMIES, SUPPORT OUR ALLIES AND HAVE OUR VETERANS ACT.
-- VETERAN'S BACK.
[CHEERING] WE NEED A LEADER WHO WILL ENSURE
AMERICA REMAINS A STRONG, STABILIZING FORCE AROUND THE GLOBE AND WHO WILL KEEP US SAFE
HERE AT HOME. OUR COUNTRY ANOTHER FOUR YEARS AT THE -- LIKE THE EIGHT WE HAVE
JUST HAD.
IT IS TIME TO STAND UP AND FIGHT
FOR THE SECURITY FOR OUR
CHILDREN. OUR GRANDCHILDREN, AND
OURSELVES. WITH HILLARY CLINTON, IT IS ALWAYS ABOUT HER. IT SHOULD BE ABOUT YOU.
[CHEERING] DONALD TRUMP IS FOCUSED ON YOU.
[CHEERING] HE GAVE A VOICE TO A MOVEMENT OF MILLIONS OF AMERICANS WHO ARE TIRED OF POLITICS AS USUAL. I KNOW AS PRESIDENT, HE WILL WORK TIRELESSLY TO KEEP OUR
NATION SAFE. NOW IS THE TIME TO MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN.
[CHEERING] THANK YOU. THANK YOU. AND MAY GOD BLESS ALL OF YOU, THE WONDERFUL STATE OF I WANT -- IOWA, THE BRAVE MEN AND WOMEN IN UNIFORM, AND IS GREAT UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. GOD BLESS YOU.
! THANK YOU.

<strong>Jason Beardsley</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> CAN SUSTAIN THE NATION WHEN
WE FIND OURSELVES IN PERIL.
THIS IS SUCH A TIME. FROM 9/11 TO RUSSIAN AGGRESSION,
TO A BELLIGERENT CHINA, AND TO
THE EVIL<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> OF THE ISLAMIC STATE, WE FACE UNPARALLELED THREATS, BUT WE STAND HERE TONIGHT ON THE
SHOULDERS OF GIANTS AND LEGENDS WHO GAVE US THIS AMERICAN REPUBLIC THAT WHEN WE THINK OF THOSE WHO PIONEERED THIS COUNTRY
WITH COURAGE AND HONOR THROUGH A BLOODY REVOLUTION, AND THOSE WHO
GAVE THEIR LIVES FOR THE CAUSE
OF FREEDOM AROUND THE WORLD, TODAY, AT THIS CRUCIAL POINT IN OUR HISTORY, CAN WE SUMMON THE SPIRIT THAT FORGED OUR NATION
AND BOUND US TOGETHER UNDER PRINCIPLES OF LIBERTY AND
JUSTICE FOR ALL?
[CHEERING] USA. IT IS TIME FOR US, ONCE AGAIN TO
CHOOSE FREEDOM OVER TYRANNY.
[CHEERING] OVER THE LAST EIGHT YEARS, THE
U.S. HAS TRADED THE ROLE OF ACTIVE LEADERSHIP FOR THAT OF A
PASSIVE OBSERVER. AMERICANS HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT THE U.S. HAS ALWAYS BEEN A FORCE FOR GOOD AND THAT SINCE WE HAVE MADE MISTAKES, WE SHOULD FORFEIT
OUR LEADERSHIP OR GOD FOR BID, WE SHOULD LEAVE THEM BEHIND. THAT THINKING HAS ENDANGERED NOT
JUST THE U.S., BUT FREEDOM
ACROSS THE WORLD AND THOSE RESULTS ALL SQUARELY ON THE SHOULDERS OF OUR CURRENT ADMINISTRATION SUPPORTED BY
HILLARY CLINTON. HER LEADERSHIP WAS ABSENT AS U.S. MARINES WERE FORCED TO
MATCH THEIR WEAPONS WHILE BUREAUCRATS ABANDONED OUR EMBASSY AND IT WAS ABSENT AS OUR ENEMIES OVERRAN ANOTHER CONFLICT
AND KILLED FOUR OF OUR AMERICANS
AT BENGHAZI. LOCK HER UP.
>> LOCKER UP! LOCKER UP! -- LOCK HER UP!
>> THIS LEADERSHIP THINK OUR
ENEMIES AND ARE ON THEIR KNEES. IT IS TIME WE PUT SOME INTO
OFFICE WHO HOLDS THE SAME
CONVICTIONS THAT WE HOLD. THE SAME CONVICTIONS THAT MY
FELLOW WARRIORS AND I HOLD.
THE SAME CONVICTIONS THAT MY FRIENDS LED OR DIED FOR. AS SERVICE MEMBERS, WE LIVE BY
THESE CONVICTIONS. USA.
CAP FIRED UP.
[CHEERING] IMAGINE A COUNTRY WHERE OUR PRESIDENT SHARES THOSE CONVICTIONS AND APPLES THE HONOR
OF OUR MILITARY, AND PRESIDENT
WHO KNOWS OUR PAST AND DEFEND
OUR LIBERTY. WITH THAT LEADERSHIP, WE WILL GO OVER THE TOP AND INTO THE TEETH OF THIS 21ST CENTURY.
" AMERICA, WE WILL HAVE THAT LEADERSHIP.
[CHEERING] GOD BLESS AMERICA.
AND DONALD TRUMP AMERICA, THE ONLY TIME SERVICE MEMBERS WILL
GET ON THEIR KNEES WILL BE TO
THINK THEIR GOD THAT THEY ARE
AMERICANS.
[CHEERING] GOD BLESS YOU AND THANK YOU AND
GOD BLESS AMERICA!
