<strong>Unidentified Speaker</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> THANK YOU VERY MUCH. PASTOR MARK EARNS WAS BACK IN
THE GREEN ROOM WITH ME AND HE
WAS SO QUIET.
[LAUGHTER] HE WAS HUMBLE HE WAS IN PRAYER AND I PUT<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> MY HAND ON HIS HEAD
AND HIS SHOULDER AND HIS HEART AND I SAID, LOSING UP.
-- LOOSEN UP. AFTER HEARING HIM BACK THERE, I
BOUGHT MY GOOD FRIEND PEYTON MANNING AND IT GETS THE DEFENSE
AND IS YELLING OMAHA! TONIGHT, I'M YELLING HELP! I KNOW OVER HERE SOMEWHERE WE
HAVE SOME MINNESOTA VIKING FANS.
[CHEERING] WE HAVE SOME NEW YORK GIANT FAN
SOMEWHERE. WEEK?
-- DON'T WE?
[CHEERING] WE HAVE SOME GEORGIA BULLDOGS? GO DOGS!
[MIXED REACTION] AND HAVE SOMETHING FOR PACKERS
FANS.
I HAVE SOMETHING FOR YOU. A GREAT STORY. THE MOST REVERED COACHING LEGEND
IN THE HISTORY OF THE NATIONAL
FOOTBALL LEAGUE IS VINCENT LOMBARDI. HE WAS A TOUGH AS NAILS
AMERICAN, LOUDLY AND BOISTEROUS
AND HE TOOK THE PACKERS, A FORLORN TEAM IN THE 50'S AND THEY WERE BROKEN AND DID NOT WIN
AND HE MADE THEM INTO A WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP TEAM YEAR AFTER YEAR. BUT AS GREAT AS HE WAS, HE DID
NOT ALWAYS WIN.
THERE IS A VIDEO ON THAT IT'S
BEEN OUT THERE FOR YEARS, IT
TELLS A STORY OF LUMBAR TO -- LOMBARDI.
HE IS ON THE SIDELINES. HE PACES LAMBEAU FIELD SIDELINED LIKE A CAGED TIGER. THE PACKERS CANNOT DO ANYTHING RIGHT THIS DAY. AND VINCE LOMBARDI WAS GOING
CRAZY. HE SCREAMS AT HIS PLAYERS
RUNNING OFF THE FIELD AND HE SAYS, WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON OUT HERE? RIGHT NOW I LOOK AT AMERICA AND
I NEED TO ASK, WHAT THE HELL IS
GOING ON HERE?
[CHEERING] THE MOST ANEMIC RECOVERY IN
MODERN HISTORY. AND WASHINGTON IS BROKEN FOR
EVERYBODY. AT LEAST BROKEN FOR EVERYBODY
WHO DOES NOT MAKE THEIR LIVING
INSIDE THE BELTWAY. WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON HERE? WE ARE STUCK IN FRUSTRATION.
MIRED IN ANGER AND FEAR.
AS A QUARTERBACK, FOR 18 YEARS,
MY MISSION WAS SIMPLE, IT WAS TO
MAKE MY TEAMMATES BETTER. OF COURSE I MADE A FORTUNE PLAYING FOOTBALL.
IN 1951, MY FIRST YEAR I MADE
$12,500. I HAD AN OFF-SEASON JOB.
I BECAME A SMALL BUSINESS OWNER. AS A SMALL BUSINESS OWNER, I
FEEL CONNECTED TO THE MILLIONS
OF AMERICANS IN THIS VITAL
CENTER OF OUR ECONOMY. LET'S GET TO THE FACTS.
SMALL BUSINESS AMERICA IS THE
HEART AND SOUL OF THE
OPPORTUNITY. THE FACTS ARE THAT 40%, LISTEN TO THIS, HE PERCENT OF 530,000 START UPS EACH MONTH ARE STARTED BY AFRICAN-AMERICANS. HISPANICS OR ASIANS. ALMOST A THIRD OF SMALL BUSINESSES IN AMERICA STARTED BY IMMIGRANTS. AND NEARLY 40% BY WOMEN. BUT THE THING IS, SMALL
BUSINESSES HAVE BEEN SURVIVING NOT BECAUSE OF GOVERNMENT POLICIES, THAT IN SPITE OF THEM.
[CHEERING] A THESE PAST EIGHT YEARS.
HIGH TAXES, STAGNANT REGULATIONS, PRACTICALLY NO
ACCESS TO CREDIT. I ASK, WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON
HERE? IMAGINE WITH ME, WHAT COULD HAPPEN IN OUR NATION IF 27 MILLION JOB CREATING ENTERPRISES WERE SUDDENLY EMPOWERED AND SET FREE IN EVERY NEIGHBORHOOD TO
GROW AND BUILD AND CONTRIBUTE EVEN MORE? I BELIEVE IT ALL COMES DOWN TO LEADERSHIP. WHETHER IT IS BEEN SOME PARTY YEARS AGO ARE THE GREAT NICK
SABIN OF ALABAMA TODAY, I CAN
TELL YOU BY SIMPLE WORDS, WHAT
EVERY GREAT LEADER DOES, A
LEADER GETS STUFF DONE.
[CHEERING] I'VE KNOWN DONALD TRUMP FOR 48 YEARS AND LIKE THOSE OTHER LEADERS, I'VE KNOWN FOR SURE
THAT HE GETS STUFF DONE.
[CHEERING] HE IS A BUILDER. HE UNDERSTANDS THAT TEAMS WHEN,
INDIVIDUALS DO NOT. HE BUILDS GREAT TEAMS. DONALD TRUMP IS A PROVEN LEADER. A TEAM BUILDER. DONALD TRUMP KNOWS HOW TO GET
THE BEST OUT OF PEOPLE, HOW TO
BE A TEAMMATE. I'VE WATCHED HIM OVER THOSE 48
YEARS SUCCEED WILDLY.
I'VE WATCHED AND FAIL BECAUSE
ALL OF US FAIL.
I'VE WATCHED HIM GET BACK UP
BECAUSE HE NEVER QUITS. I TRULY BELIEVE THAT DONALD
TRUMP CAN PROVIDE THE LEADERSHIP THAT WILL HELP US ALL MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN.
[CHEERING] MAKE IT GREAT. MAKE IT GREAT FOR EVERYONE. LET'S GO. YOU PEOPLE OUT THERE, LET'S GO. AND WHEN THIS GAME -- EIN THIS
-- WIN THIS GAME TOGETHER.
LET'S GO MAKE AMERICA GREAT
AGAIN. THANK YOU AND GOOD NIGHT.
