<strong>Rick Perry</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> HELLO, CLEVELAND!
[CHEERING]
>> BACK IN 2000 AND SIX -- 2006,
MY WIFE ANITA AND I, WE HAD THIS
EXTRAORDINARY EXPERIENCE, THIS
GREAT PLEASURE OF TOURING<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> AND
NAVAL BASE IN SAN DIEGO.
-- A  NAVAL BASE IN SAN DIEGO. OUR GUIDE THAT DAY JUST HAPPENED TO BE THIS BIG OLD TOPIC OF WATER NAVY SEAL WHO WAS
RECOVERING FROM COMBAT RELATED
INJURIES. NOW, HE IS A TEXAS BOY.
[CHEERING] HE WAS PRETTY PLAINSPOKEN AND RESPECTFUL AND HIS LOVE FOR AMERICA CAME THROUGH LOUD AND CLEAR. AS WE DEPARTED THAT DAY, I TOLD HIM, IF YOU'RE EVER IN AUSTIN,
AND BY NCS.
-- SEE US. SOME PEOPLE MIGHT SAY THAT
MEETING WAS JUST BLIND CHANCE. OR A TWIST OF FATE. I WILL TELL YOU, IT WAS BY THE
GRACE OF GOD.
[CHEERING] HE AND I KEPT IN TOUCH. OVER THE COURSE OF THE MONTHS
THROUGH A TOUR HE HAD IN IRAQ
AND HIS RETURN TO TEXAS. DARNED IF YOU DID NOT SHOW UP ON
THE DOORSTEP OF THE GOVERNOR'S
MANSION UNANNOUNCED. WITH NOWHERE ELSE TO GO. WE WELCOMED HIM INTO OUR HOME. WE HELPED HIM GET THE CARE THAT
HE NEEDED. AND TODAY, HE'S LIKE A SECOND
SON. MANY OF YOU KNOW THE
BATTLES HE FOUGHT IN
AFGHANISTAN, BUT TOO FEW OF YOU
KNOW THE BATTLES HE AND
THOUSANDS OF VETERANS JUST LIKE HIM FACE WHEN THEY COME HOME.
[CHEERING] TONIGHT, OUR COMMITMENT IS THIS,
MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN
STARTS BY TAKING CARE OF OUR
VETERANS.
[CHEERING] THANK YOU.
[CHEERING] LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, PLEASE WELCOME AN AMERICAN HERO, THE LONE SURVIVOR, MARCUS LATRELL.
[CHEERING]
-- LUTRELL.
