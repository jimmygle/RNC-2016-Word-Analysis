<strong>Patricia A. Smith</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> MY NAME IS PATRICIA SMITH. MY SON SEAN WAS ONE OF FOUR
BRAVE AMERICANS KILLED DURING TO
TELL THE 12 -- THE 2000 VOTERS
ATTACK IN BENGHAZI.
HE WAS A<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> WONDERFUL SON AND
FATHER TO MY TWO AMAZING
GRANDCHILDREN. SAMANTHA AND NATHAN, NOW 10 AND 11. HE WAS PROUD TO SERVE HIS COUNTRY WITH THE UNITED STATES
FOREIGN SERVICE. THE LAST TIME I TALK TO SOME,
BUT THAT BEFORE THE ATTACK, HE
TOLD ME MOM, I'M GOING TO DIE. SECURITY HAD BEEN PULLED FROM
THE EMBASSY.
EXPLAIN.
-- HE EXPLAINED.
WHEN HE ASKED WHY, HE NEVER
RECEIVED A RESPONSE. NOBODY SEEMED TO CARE. THE VERY NEXT DAY, HE WAS MURDERED. MURDERED BY RADICAL ISLAMIC
TERRORISTS. TODAY THIS DAY -- TO THIS DAY
COME I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHY A
BITTER GUY LIKE SOME WAS SENT TO
BENGHAZI. WE LOST SEAN, BROTHER, FATHER, HUSBAND.
WE LOST FOR BRAVE AMERICANS WHO
MADE THE ULTIMATE SACRIFICE FOR
THE COUNTRY DAY SERVED AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE LOST THE TRUTH
FOR ALL OF THIS LOSS AND GRIEF,
FOR ALL THE CITIZENS OF THE
TRAGEDY IN BENGHAZI, IT HAS
BROUGHT A GUN -- UPON AMERICA, I
BY HILLARY CLINTON -- BLAME HILLARY CLINTON.
[CHEERING] I BLAME HILLARY CLINTON PERSONALLY FOR THE DEATH OF MY
SON. PERSONALLY. IN AN E-MAIL TO HER DAUGHTER
SHORTLY AFTER THE ATTACK, HILLARY CLINTON BLAMED IT ON TERRORISM, BUT WHEN I SAW HILLARY CLINTON, SHE LIED TO ME
AND THEN CALLED ME A LIAR.
>> BOO! WHEN I SAW HILLARY CLINTON AT SEAN'S COFFIN CEREMONY, SHE
LOOKED ME IN THE EYE AND TOLD ME
A VIDEO WAS RESPONSIBLE.
>> BOO!
>> SINCE THEN I HAVE REPEATEDLY
ASKED HILLARY CLINTON TO ASK
PLAINTIFF MAY THE REAL REASON WHY MY SON IS DEAD. I'M STILL WAITING. WHENEVER I CALLED THE STATE DEPARTMENT, NO ONE WOULD SPEAK TO ME BECAUSE THEY SAY I AM NOT
A MEMBER OF THE IMMEDIATE FAMILY.
>> BOO!
>> SEAN IS MY SON. HILLARY CLINTON IS A WOMAN, A
MOTHER, A GRANDMOTHER OF TWO. I AM A WOMAN, A MOTHER, AND A
MOTHER OF TWO. HOW COULD SHE DO THIS TO ME? HOW COULD SHE DO THIS TO ANY AMERICAN FAMILY? DONALD TRUMP IS EVERYTHING HILLARY CLINTON IS NOT.
[CHEERING] HE IS BLUNT, DIRECT, AND STRONG. HE SPEAKS HIS MIND AND HIS
HEART. AND WHEN IT COMES TO THE THREAT
POSED BY RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM, HE WILL NOT HESITATE
TO KILL THE TERRORIST WHO
THREATEN AMERICAN LIVES.
[CHEERING] HE WILL MAKE AMERICA STRONGER,
NOT WEAKER. THIS ENTIRE CAMPAIGN COMES DOWN
TO A SINGLE QUESTION, IS HILLARY CLINTON -- IT'S CLINTON CAN'T
GIVE US THE TRUTH, WHY SHOULD WE
GIVE HER THE PRESIDENCY?
[CHEERING] THAT IS RIGHT. HILLARY CLINTON FOR PRISON.
[CHEERING] SHE DESERVES TO BE IN STRIPES.</span><span class='hidden-full-transcript-ellipses'>...</span></p><a href='#' class='hidden-full-transcript-link'><i class='icon-chevron-down'></i> <span class='link-show-full-text'>Show Full Text</span><i class='icon-chevron-up'></i> <span class='link-show-less-text'>Show Less Text</span></a>
