<strong>David A. Clarke Jr.</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> THANK YOU.
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.
I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE SOMETHING
VERY CLEAR, BLUE LIVES MATTER IN
AMERICA.
[CHEERING]
>> USA. USA. USA.
>> I STAND BEFORE<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> YOU TONIGHT WITH A HEAVY HEART. AT THE LAW ENFORCEMENT COMMUNITY PREPARES TO BURY THREE OF BATON ROUGE'S LOUISIANA FINEST. THERE IS SOME GOOD NEWS. OUT OF BALTIMORE MARYLAND AS LIEUTENANT BRIAN RICE WAS
ACQUITTED ON ALL CHARGES.
[CHEERING] IN THE MALICIOUS PROSECUTION OF ACTIVIST STATE ATTORNEY MARILYN MOSBY.
>> BOO! I WOULD TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT
SOMETHING IMPORTANT. A CONCEPT THAT FIVE ON ABORTION
OFFICERS WERE MURDERED AND NINE
MORE WERE WOUNDED FOR EARLIER THIS MONTH. AND FOR THREE MORE MURDERED TWO DAYS AGO IN BATON ROUGE,
LOUISIANA. THAT IS THE IMPORTANT -- IMPORTANCE OF MAKING AMERICA
SAFER AGAIN.
[CHEERING] I BELIEVE THAT THIS NOBLE MISSION IS NOT JUST A
REQUIREMENT BUT A PRE-WHAT WAS IT FOR ACHIEVING THE CAMPAIGN GOAL OF MAKING AMERICA GREAT
AGAIN.
[CHEERING] WE SIMPLY CANNOT BE GREAT IF WE
DO NOT FEEL SAFE IN OUR HOME, OUR STREETS, OUR SCHOOLS.
I SEE THIS EVERY DAY AT STREET
LEVEL. MANY AMERICANS INCREASINGLY HAVE AN UNEASINESS ABOUT THE ABILITY
OF THEIR FAMILY TO LIVE SAFELY
IN THESE TROUBLING TIMES. THIS TRANSCENDS RACE, RELIGION, ETHNICITY, GENDER, AGE, AND
LIFESTYLE.
[CHEERING] IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE IT, A RECENT GALLUP POLL CONFIRMS IT. MORE THAN HALF OF ALL AMERICANS
NOW WORRY A GREAT DEAL ABOUT
CRIME AND VIOLENCE. CONSISTENTLY UP FROM A FEW YEARS AGO. AND FOR AFRICAN-AMERICANS, THAT NUMBER IS 70%. SADLY, TRY GROWING NUMBER OF
COMMUNITIES, THE SENSE OF SAFETY
THAT MANY OF US ONCE TOOK FOR
GRANTED HAS BEEN SHATTERED. AMERICANS DON'T ALWAYS FEEL SAFE
AND THAT IF THEY'RE WORKING IN A
BIG CITY, LIVING IN A SUBURB OR RURAL AREAS ALL AROUND THIS GREAT COUNTRY, I OFTEN TELL RESIDENTS OF MILWAUKEE IN THE CITY AND TOWN THAT VISIT, THAT
SAFETY IS A SHARED ENDEAVOR.
'S SIZE WITH A WILLING
ACCEPTANCE OF PEOPLE TO PLAY BY
SOCIETY'S RULES. A CODE, IF YOU WELL, THEY CODE
WHERE WE COLLECTIVELY AGREE UPON THAT INSURED STABILITY, FAIRNESS AND INSPECT.
-- RESPECT.
IT IS BUILT ON THE FOUNDATION OF
TRUST. AND THE PEOPLE WHO ADMINISTER AND ENFORCE SOCIETIES RULES AT ITS FOUNDATION IS A RULE OF LAW. THE [CHEERING]
--
[CHEERING] IN 1963, DARKENED -- DR. MARTIN LUTHER KING WROTE PASSIONATE ABOUT THE INTERRELATEDNESS OF
ALL COMMUNITIES AND ABOUT OUR INESCAPABLE NETWORK OF MUTUALITY TYING US TO A SINGLE GARMENT OF
DESTINY. HE SPOKE ABOUT THE BASIC REALITY
OF THE RULE OF LAW PROVIDED THAT
IT IS APPLIED EQUALLY TO BOTH THE WEALTHY AND THE IMPOVERISHED, BOTH MEN AND WOMEN, AND YES THE MAJORITY AND
MINORITY.
[CHEERING] WHAT WE WITNESSED IN FERGUSON
AND BALTIMORE AND BATON ROUGE
WAS A COLLAPSE OF THE SOCIAL
ORDER. SO MANY OF THE ACTIONS OF THE
OCCUPY MOVEMENT AND BLACK LIVES MATTER TRANSCEND PEOPLE PROTEST
AND VIOLATES THE CODE OF CONDUCT
WE RELY ON. I CALLED ANARCHY.
-- CALL IT ANARCHY.
[CHEERING] AMERICAN LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS UNDERSTAND THAT RACE IS
AND HAS BEEN A HEATED ISSUE IN OUR COUNTRY. MOST APPRECIATE THE VITAL NEED
FOR THOROUGHNESS AND TRANSPARENCY IN PURSUIT OF THE
GREATER GOOD IN THEIR THESE ARE TRUTHS THAT ARE SELF EVIDENT TO ME AND THAT I
PRACTICE. THEY ARE THE TRUTHS THE DONALD TRUMP UNDERSTANDS AND SUPPORTS.
[APPLAUSE] DONALD TRUMP IS THE STEADFAST
LEADER OUR NATION NEEDS. HE HAS SPOKEN PASSIONATELY TO ME OF HIS BELIEF IN OUR AMERICAN
SYSTEM OF JUSTICE. HE SPEAKS TO THE VALUES THAT ARE
AT THE FOUNDATION OF OUR SOCIAL
CONTRACT. THROUGHOUT HIS CAMPAIGN OVER MANY YEARS HE HAS CONSISTENTLY
AND CONSTANTLY RAISED HIS VOICE NOT ONLY IN DEFENSE OF THE POLICE OFFICER BUT OF THE NEED
FOR ALL PEOPLE TO FEEL THAT THEY
ARE BEING TREATED FAIRLY AND
RESPECTFULLY BY LAW ENFORCEMENT.
[APPLAUSE] DONALD TRUMP UNDERSTANDS THAT
WHAT CAN MAKE OUR NATION SAFE AGAIN IS A RECOMMITMENT TO A
SYSTEM OF JUSTICE IN WHICH NO GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL, NO PRIVATE CITIZEN, NO ELECTED OFFICIAL EVEN HILLARY CLINTON, AND NO
GROUP OF PEOPLE DESPITE THE
FERVOR WITH WHICH THEY PUT FORTH
IN THEIR GRIEVANCES. CAN BE ABOVE THE LAW.
IT CANNOT HAPPEN IN THE UNITED STATES.
[APPLAUSE] THE TRADITION OF THE PRIMACY OF
THE RULE OF LAW IN AMERICA IS
STRONG. IT IS IN OUR ACTIONS THAT WE
WILL MOVE FORWARD TOWARD MAKING
AMERICA SAFE AGAIN. GOD BLESS YOU AND MAY GOD
CONTINUE TO BLESS THESE UNITED
STATES OF AMERICA.
[APPLAUSE]
