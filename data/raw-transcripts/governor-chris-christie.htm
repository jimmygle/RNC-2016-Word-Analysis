<strong>Chris Christie</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> GOVERNOR CHRISTIE: GOOD EVENING. I AM HERE TONIGHT NOT ONLY AS
THE GOVERNOR OF NEW JERSEY, BUT
ALSO AS DONALD TRUMP'S FRIEND
FOR THE LAST 14 YEARS. WE<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> ARE ABOUT TO BE LED BY NOT
ONLY A STRONG LEADER BUT BY A CARING, GENUINE, AND DECENT PERSON.
I AM PROUD TO SAY THE VOICE OF
THE PEOPLE OF OUR NATIONS BEING
HEARD IN THIS HALL TONIGHT AND
THOSE VOICES WANT DONALD TRUMP
TO BE THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE
UNITED STATES.
[APPLAUSE] BUT EVERYBODY, THIS ELECTION IS
NOT JUST ABOUT DONALD TRUMP. IT IS ALSO ABOUT HIS DEMOCRATIC
OPPONENT, HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON.
[BOOING] IN THE PAST FEW WEEKS, WE HAVE
SEEN THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT
REFUSED TO PROSECUTE HER.
OVER THE LAST EIGHT YEARS, WE
HAVE SEEN THIS ADMINISTRATION REFUSED TO HOLD HER ACCOUNTABLE
FOR HER RISIBLE RECORD AS SECRETARY OF STATE SO LET'S DO
SOMETHING FUN TONIGHT.
AS A FORMER FEDERAL PROSECUTOR,
I WELCOME THE OPPORTUNITY TO HOLD HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON
ACCOUNTABLE FOR HER PERFORMANCE
AND HER CHARACTER.
[APPLAUSE] NOW -- 
[CHANTING] WE ARE GETTING THERE. GIVE ME A FEW MORE MINUTES, WE
WILL GET THERE. WE ARE GOING TO PRESENT THE FACTS TO YOU.
YOU TONIGHT SITTING AS A JURY OF HER PEERS IN THIS HALL AND IN
YOUR LIVING ROOMS AROUND OUR
NATION. SINCE THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT
REFUSES TO ALLOW YOU TO RENDER A
VERDICT, I WILL RESENT THE CASE
NOW ON THE FACTS AGAINST HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] NOW, SHE WAS AMERICA'S CHIEF DIPLOMAT SO LET'S LOOK AROUND
THE WORLD AT THE VIOLENCE AND
DANGER TODAY IN EVERY REGION THAT HAS BEEN INFECTED BY HER
FLAWED JUDGMENT. I AM GOING TO BE SPECIFIC SO YOU
CAN RENDER YOUR VERDICT TONIGHT
ON THE BASIS OF THE FACTS. LET'S GO TO NORTH AFRICA. SHE WAS THE CHIEF ENGINEER OF
THE DISASTER'S OVERTHROW IN
LIBYA. LIBYA TODAY AFTER HILLARY
CLINTON'S GRAND STRATEGY, THEIR ECONOMY IS IN RUINS, THERE IS
DEATH AND VIOLENCE IN THE STREETS, AND ISIS IS DOMINATING
THAT COUNTRY. HILLARY CLINTON AS A FAILURE FOR
RUINING LIBYA AND CREATING A
NEST FOR TERRORIST ACTIVITY,
ANSWER MAY NOW, IS SHE GUILTY OR NOT GUILTY? IN NIGERIA, HILLARY CLINTON AMAZINGLY FOUGHT FOR TWO YEARS TO KEEP AN AL QAEDA AFFILIATE
OFF OF THE TERRORIST WATCH LIST. WHAT HAPPENED BECAUSE OF THIS
RECKLESS ACTION BY THE CANDIDATE
WHO IS THE SELF-PROCLAIMED
CHAMPION OF WOMEN ALL AROUND THE WORLD, THESE AL QAEDA TERRORISTS ABDUCTED HUNDREDS OF INNOCENT YOUNG WOMEN TWO YEARS AGO. THESE SCHOOLGIRLS ARE STILL MISSING TODAY. AND WHAT WAS THE SOLUTION FROM THE OBAMA CLINTON TEAM? A HASH TAG CAMPAIGN. LET'S DECIDE -- HILLARY CLINTON AS AN APOLOGIST FOR NOW KATIE A
-- AN AL QAEDA AFFILIATE IN
NIGERIA RESULTING IN THE CAPTURE OF INNOCENT YOUNG WOMEN, IS SHE
GUILTY OR NOT GUILTY?
>> GUILTY. GOVERNOR CHRISTIE: SHE NEVER
FIGHTS FOR US. SHE DOESN'T GET THE REAL THREAT
THAT AMERICA FACES SO NOW LET'S
GO TO CHINA. HILLARY CLINTON PRAISE THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT FOR FINANCING BARACK OBAMA'S BLOATED STIMULUS
PLAN. SHE WAS SO DESPERATE FOR CHINESE CASH, SHE PROMISED TO BUY AMERICAN PROVISIONS IN EXCHANGE
FOR THE CASH TO FINANCE A HUGE EXPANSION OF FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SPENDING. HILLARY CLINTON PUTTING BIG
GOVERNMENT SPENDING FINANCED BY
THE CHINESE AHEAD OF GOOD PAYING
JOBS FOR MIDDLE-CLASS AMERICANS, IS SHE GUILTY OR NOT GUILTY?
>> GUILTY. GOVERNOR CHRISTIE: LET'S GO TO
SYRIA.
IMAGINE THIS -- SHE CALLED PRESIDENT ASSAD A REFORMER.
SHE CALLED ASSAD A DIFFERENT
KIND OF LEADER. THERE ARE NOW 400,000 DEAD.
THINK ABOUT THAT. 400,000 DEAD. AT THE HANDS OF THE MAN THAT HILLARY DEFENDED. SO WE MUST ASK THIS QUESTION,
HILLARY CLINTON AS AN AWFUL JUDGE OF THE CHARACTER OF A DICTATOR AND BUTCHER IN THE
MIDDLE EAST, IS SHE GUILTY OR
NOT GUILTY?
>> GUILTY. GOVERNOR CHRISTIE: NEXT IN IRAN,
SHE LAUNCHED NEGOTIATIONS THAT
BROUGHT ABOUT THE WORST NUCLEAR
DEAL IN HISTORY. LET ME BE CLEAR -- AMERICA AND THE WORLD ARE MEASURABLY LESS SAFE BECAUSE OF THE IRAN DEAL
HILLARY HELPED CUT. AFTER SHE LAUNCHED THOSE
NEGOTIATIONS, SHE BECAME THE
BIGGEST CHEERLEADER FOR THIS
AGREEMENT. IF A DEAL THAT WILL LEAD TO A NUCLEAR IRAN AND A MUCH MORE
DANGEROUS MIDDLE EAST. HILLARY CLINTON AS AN INEPT NEGOTIATOR OF THE WORST NUCLEAR
ARMS DEAL IN AMERICAN HISTORY, GUILTY OR NOT GUILTY?
>> GUILTY. GOVERNOR CHRISTIE: NEXT --
[CHANTING] THE INDICTMENT IS HARDLY
COMPLETE. NEXT, LET'S GO TO RUSSIA. SHE GAVE THEM THAT STUPID
SYMBOLIC RESET BUTTON.
YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK THAT SHOULD HAVE READ?
IT SHOULD HAVE READ DELETE.
SHE'S VERY GOOD AT THAT, BY THE
WAY.
[CHEERS] EDIT SHOULD HAVE READ DELETE BECAUSE SHE DELETED IN FOUR YEARS THE SAFETY AND SECURITY THAT TOOK US TO BUILD IN 40
YEARS. THE NEXT YEAR, SHE SAID OUR
GOAL, AMERICA'S GOAL WAS TO
STRENGTHEN RUSSIA. STRENGTHEN AN ADVERSARY LED BY A
DICTATOR WHO DREAMS OF FREE ASSEMBLING THE SOVIET EMPIRE.
WHAT AN EXTRAORDINARILY
DANGEROUS LACK OF JUDGMENT. ONCE AGAIN, WE NEED TO ASK AS A
FAILED STRATEGIST WHO HAS PERMIT
RUSSIA BACK INTO A MAJOR PLAYER
IN THE MIDDLE EAST, HILLARY
CLINTON GUILTY OR NOT GUILTY?
>> GUILTY. GOVERNOR CHRISTIE: NOW WE GO TO
CUBA. HILLARY CLINTON SUPPORTED
CONCESSIONS TO THE CASTRO BROTHERS AND GOT ALMOST NOTHING IN RETURN FOR ENDING THE
EMBARGO.
SHE SUPPORTED A DEAL THAT DIDN'T EVEN REQUIRE THIS MURDEROUS
REGIME TO RETURN A COP KILLER TO FACE JUSTICE. I KNOW ABOUT THIS PERSONALLY. HE MURDERED A NEW JERSEY STATE TROOPER IN COLD BLOOD, FLED TO CUBA, AND LIVES THERE UNDER
CUBAN PROTECTION TO THIS DAY. I WANT TO ASK YOU, HOW CAN SOMEONE LIVE WITH THEIR OWN CONSCIENCE WHEN YOU REWARD A
DOMESTIC TERRORIST WITH
CONTINUED SAFETY AND BETRAY THE FAMILY OF A FALLEN POLICE OFFICER WAITING FOR DECADES FOR
JUSTICE FOR HIS MURDER? HILLARY CLINTON AS A CAUSAL OR
OF THE BRUTAL CASTRO BROTHERS AND BETRAYER OF THE FAMILY OF
FOUR AND FALLEN STATE TROOPER OR
IN FOSTER AND HIS FAMILY, IS SHE
GUILTY OR NOT GUILTY?
>> GUILTY.
[CHANTING] GOVERNOR CHRISTIE: FINALLY HERE
AT HOME AND ONE OF THE FIRST
DECISIONS AS SECRETARY OF STATE,
SHE SAID OF A PRIVATE E-MAIL SERVER IN HER BASEMENT. THEN SHE LIED ABOUT IT OVER AND
OVER AGAIN.
SHE SAID THERE WAS NO MARKED
CLASSIFIED INFORMATION ON HER
SERVER. THE FBI DIRECTOR SAID THAT
UNTRUE. SHE SAID SHE DID NOT ANY
CLASSIFIED INFORMATION.
THE FBI DIRECTOR SAID THAT'S NOT
TRUE.
SHE SAID ALL WORK-RELATED E-MAILS WERE SENT BACK TO THE
STATE DEPARTMENT. SO, THE CHARGE OF PUTTING HERSELF AHEAD OF AMERICA, GUILTY
OR NOT GUILTY?
>> GUILTY.
[CHANTING] GOVERNOR CHRISTIE: WHAT IS YOUR
VERDICT, GUILTY OR NOT GUILTY?
>> GUILTY. GOVERNOR CHRISTIE: TIME AFTER TIME AFTER TIME, THE FACTS AND JUST THE FACTS LEAD YOU TO THE
SAME VERDICT AROUND THE WORLD AND HERE AT HOME. IN LIBYA AND NIGERIA, GUILTY. IN CHINA AND SYRIA --
>> GUILTY. GOVERNOR CHRISTIE: IN CUBA WITH BLACK GUILTY. AND LYING TO COVER IT ALL UP --
>> GUILTY. GOVERNOR CHRISTIE: MEANT TO
OBSCURE ALL THE FACTS AND LEAVE
YOU ABLE TO VOTE FOR HER.
WE CANNOT PROMOTE SOMEONE TO COMMANDER IN CHIEF WHO HAS MADE
THE WORLD A MORE VIOLENT AND
DANGEROUS PLACE WITH EVERY BAD JUDGMENT SHE HAS MADE. WE CANNOT MAKE THE CHIEF LAW
ENFORCEMENT OFFICER OF THE
UNITED STATES, SOMEONE WHO HAS
RAISED AMERICA'S EGRETS AND LIE
TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ABOUT IT
DAY AFTER DAY.
HERE IT IS, WE DIDN'T DISQUALIFY
HILLARY CLINTON, THE FACTS OF
HER LIFE AND CAREER DISQUALIFY
HER.
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] GOVERNOR CHRISTIE: EVERYBODY IN
THIS HALL OF GREECE -- AGREES. YOU ARE THE ONES WHO WILL DECIDE
THIS ELECTION. WE HAVE AN ALTERNATIVE. WE HAVE A MAN WHO IS UNAFRAID, A MAN WHO WANTS TO LEAD US, A MAN WHO UNDERSTANDS THE FRUSTRATION
AND ASPIRATIONS OF FELLOW CITIZENS, A MAN WHO JUDGES PEOPLE ON THEIR PERFORMANCE
REGARDLESS OF YOUR GENDER, RACE,
RELIGIOUS BACKGROUND. I IMPLORE YOU, WE DO NOT NEED TO SETTLE FOR LESS IN THIS ELECTION.
WE CANNOT REWARD INCOMPETENCE AND DECEIT. WE NEED TO DEMAND MORE THAN WHAT
HILLARY CLINTON OFFERS FOR AMERICA BECAUSE WE KNOW WHAT
FOUR YEARS OF HILLARY CLINTON WILL BRING.
ALL THE FAILURES OF THE OBAMA YEARS BUT WITH LESS CHARM AND MORE LIES.
[APPLAUSE] IT IS OUR OBLIGATION TO STOP
HILLARY CLINTON NOW AND NEVER
LET HER GET WITHIN 10 MILES OF
THE WHITE HOUSE AGAIN.
[APPLAUSE] IT IS TIME TO COME TOGETHER AND MAKE SURE DONALD TRUMP IS THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED
STATES. I AM PROUD TO BE PART OF THIS TEAM. LET'S GO GET THEM.
GOOD NIGHT.
