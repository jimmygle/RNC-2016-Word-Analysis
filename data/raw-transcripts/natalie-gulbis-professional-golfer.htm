<strong>Natalie Gulbis</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> NATALIE: THANK YOU. I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO
TALK ABOUT A MAN THAT I GREATLY
ADMIRE, SOMEONE GRACIOUS, GENEROUS AND INSPIRING. I MUST BEGIN BY<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> SAYING VISIT
GREAT DEAL OF IRONY THAT I'M SPEAKING TO YOU BECAUSE WHEN I
EARNED MY REPORT CARD 16 YEARS AGO, I WAS TOLD THERE WERE ONLY TWO THINGS YOU DON'T TALK ABOUT IN PUBLIC, FAITH AND POLITICS. TONIGHT I AM PREPARED TO VIOLATE
BOTH OF THOSE ADMONITIONS.
[APPLAUSE] AS I STAND BEFORE YOU AT THE
REPUBLICAN NATIONAL CONVENTION AS A CHRISTIAN WOMAN.
[APPLAUSE] I BELIEVE THAT GOD'S TIMING IS
PERFECT AND HE PUTS PEOPLE IN
OUR LIVES TO HELP MAKE US A
POSITIVE IMPACT ON THOSE AROUND
US. AND TO HELP US ACHIEVE OUR
GOALS. ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE FOR ME IS
DONALD TRUMP. THE FIRST TIME I PLAYED GOLF
WITH HIM IN 2005, I SHARED 2 THINGS I TOLD COUNTLESS CEOS
BEFORE HIM. ONE, I HAD A DREAM TO OPEN UP MY
OWN BOYS AND GIRLS CLUB.
AND TWO, I WAS DEEPLY FRUSTRATED
ABOUT BEING TREATED DIFFERENTLY
AS A WOMAN. OVERLOOKED AND UNDER PATENT
BUSINESS. THESE WORDS PREVIOUSLY FELL ON DEAF, WELL-INTENTIONED EARS.
THAT'S A WAS DIFFERENT. THEY FINALLY FELL ON YEARS THAT
CARED ENOUGH TO TAKE ACTION. I AM PROUD TO TELL YOU THAT WITH DONALD'S HELP, I OPENED UP THE
NATALIE GOLEMAN BOYS AND GIRLS CLUB.
[APPLAUSE] AND IN RESPONSE TO MY FRUSTRATIONS ABOUT BEING TREATED
UNFAIRLY AS A WOMAN, HE ADAMANTLY REJECTED THE NOTION
AND OFFERED ME A SIMPLE IDEA
THAT CHANGED MY LIFE FOREVER.
NEVER FEAR CHALLENGING THE
STATUS QUO. HE ENCOURAGED ME TO THINK ABOUT
MYSELF IS A FEMALE ATHLETE, BUT
AS A BUSINESS PERSON. IN EVERYTHING THAT YOU DO, BE FEARLESS, HE REMINDED ME. AS AN ATHLETE, FEARLESSNESS CAME NATURALLY TO ME.
BUT AS A BUSINESSWOMAN, I FACED CHALLENGES THAT WERE NOT ALWAYS ON A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD. EVEN TODAY I FACED CHALLENGES"
MEANS A CONSISTENT VOICE,
ENCOURAGING ME TO STAND UP TO GENDER INJUSTICES AND CELINE AND
TO ANY PROFESSIONAL CHALLENGE
THAT COMES MY WAY.
-- AND TO LEAN IN TO ANY
PROFESSIONAL CHALLENGE THAT
COMES MY WAY. I HOPE YOU TAKE THESE PRINCIPLES OF FEARLESSNESS AND THAT THEY CAN HAVE A SIMILAR IMPACT IN YOU
R LIFE. RONALD REAGAN SAID STATUS QUO IS LATIN FOR THE MESS WE ARE IN. WHILE I BELIEVE THIS IS THE GREATEST TIME TO BE A WOMAN IN THE GREATEST COUNTRY IN THE
HISTORY OF THE WORLD, I HAVE NO DELUSIONS THAT THERE ISN'T A
MESS TO CLEAN UP. WE DESPERATELY NEED SOMEONE TO
CLEAN UP THAT MESS. THAT PERSON IS DONALD TRUMP.
[APPLAUSE] AND IT'S HISTORY OF FEARLESSNESS THAT IS AN INDICATOR OF CHANGE,
THEN DONALD TRUMP IS THE PERSON
TO BRING THAT TO AMERICA. THANK YOU.
[APPLAUSE]
