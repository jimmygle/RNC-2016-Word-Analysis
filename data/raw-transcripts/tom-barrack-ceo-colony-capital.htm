<strong>TOM</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> TOM: THIS IS A WOW. 
I FEEL LIKE THE ANCHOVY ON IVNAK A'S CESAR SALAD. I KNOW YOU'RE SALIVATING. BEFORE I START, I HAVE TO TELL YOU A FUNNY STORY.
FOR<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> SURE I WAS A LITTLE BIT NERVOUS.
I HAVE A GREAT UNCLE IN BEIRUT WHO IS AN UNBELIEVABLE INTERNATIONAL LAWYER AND ORA TORTOR. 
YOU'VE GOT TO HELP -- ORATOR. I SAID YOU'VE GOT TO HELP ME. I'M A LITTLE BIT NERVOUS. SO CAN YOU GIVE ME SOME ADVICE. HE SAID, WHY WOULD THEY HAVE YOU?
[LAUGHTER] I SAID THAT'S NOT EXACTLY WHAT I NEED. 
I NEED TO BE PUMPED UP. I'M NERVOUS. I NEED SOME CONFIDENCE. DON'T DO THIS TO ME. OK. OK. 
GIVE ME TWO MINUTES, LET ME THINK.
I'VE GOT IT.
I'VE GOT IT.
YOU'RE JUST LIKE A DECEASED AT  
AN IRISH WAKE.
I SAID YOU MEAN, I'M THAT GOOD? HE SAID NO, YOU NEED TO GET THINGS STARTED BUT NOBODY 
EXPECTS YOU TO SAY VERY MUCH. 
SO WITH THAT, I WANT TO START.
AND I'M HERE BECAUSE DONALD 
TRUMP IS ONE OF MY CLOSEST  
FRIENDS FOR 40 YEARS. 
AND I'M THE SON OF A VERY HUMBLE LEBANESE GROCER FROM CULVER CITY, CALIFORNIA. 
WHERE'S CALIFORNIA? 
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] 
YES. AND I'M HERE BECAUSE OF THE AMAZING MAGIC ELIXER THAT 
HAPPENED BETWEEN THE D.N.A. OF A
THOUSAND CIVILIZATION FROM THE  
LAVAT AND THE BEAUTY TAPPED 
WONDER AND THE OPPORTUNITY OF AMERICA THAT PUTS ALL OF US HERE IN THIS RAP CHURE OF THE  
AMERICAN DREAM FOR ME TO BE HERE TONIGHT TO TALK ABOUT MY FRIEND, MY PARTNER AND THE FUTURE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, DONALD TRUMP. 
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] SO WHAT I'M GOING TO DO IS  
SOMETHING DIFFERENT.
YOU'RE GOING TO HATE ME FOR IT BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT GOING TO HEAR ONE NEGATIVE THING OUT OF MY  
MOUTH. I HAVE NOTHING NEGATIVE THING TO
SAY ABOUT HILLARY.
I HAVE ONLY AMAZING THINGS TO 
TELL YOU ABOUT DONALD.
[APPLAUSE]
BECAUSE THIS MAN IS GOOD ENOUGH.
HE'S TOUGH ENOUGH.
HE'S SMART ENOUGH AND HE'S WELL VERSED ENOUGH TO DO IT ON HIS OWN MERITS. 
WE DON'T NEED TO GO ANY PLACE ELSE. 
SO WHAT I WANT TO DO IS SPEND A 
LITTLE TIME TALKING TO YOU ABOUT THE MESSENGER, THE MAN. WITHOUT HIS ARMOR, WITHOUT HIS  
WEAPONRY, WALKING DOWN THE TUNNEL INTO THE ARENA, WHO IS 
HE? 
WHAT IS HE MADE OUT OF? 
SO IF WE START AN EASY PLACE TO 
FIND HIM IS IN HIS CHILDREN.
AND YOU'VE ALL HAD THE GREAT  
OPPORTUNITY TO SEE HIS KIDS OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS.
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT?
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] 
AND THE LITMUS TEST IS IN THE 
CHILDREN. MY MOTHER USED TO SAY, YOU LEARN
HOW TO BE A MAN BY WATCHING YOUR FATHER. 
YOU WATCH THIS MAN, YOU GET IT. 
THOSE OF US WHO ARE MARRIED OR HAVE A PARTNER UNDERSTAND THAT  
THE BEST REFLECTIONS OF US IS OUR WIVES.
IN MY CASE FOR SURE, IT'S 
ROCHELLE. AND IN DONALD'S CASE IS MELANIA. AND MELANIA, I WANT TO TELL YOU 
ON BEHALF OF THE 10,000 PEOPLE  
AND THE 50 MILLION PEOPLE WHO 
ARE WATCHING YOU ARE A TIMELESS 
TRIBUTE TO BEAUTY, GRACE AND  
ELEGANCE UNDER PRESSURE. YOU'RE AMAZING. YOU'RE AWESOME. SO I'M GOING TO USE WORDS THAT  
YOU PROBABLY HAVEN'T HEARD ABOUT
DONALD. I STARTED MY RELATIONSHIP WITH  
HIM IN A FUNNY WAY. I HAD THE FORTUNE OF WORKING FOR A MAN NAMED BOB BASS IN FORT  
WORTH, TEXAS. 
IN THE 1980'S WE BOUGHT A HOTEL 
COMPANY AND THE HOTEL COMPANY HAPPENED TO OWN THE HOTEL THAT  
WAS RIGHT BEHIND DONALD'S WINDOW IN HIS OFFICE. SO YOU KNOW DONALD WELL ENOUGH BY NOW TO KNOW THAT HE NEEDED THAT HOTEL. AND I WAS A YOUNG PUP. HE WAS A BIG GUY IN NEW YORK. HE WANTED TO BUY THE HOTEL. LONG STORY SHORT WE ENDED UP  
HAVING 30 LAWYERS, 50 ACCOUNTANTS.
I'M SCARED TO DEATH BECAUSE MY  
BOSS WAS GOING TO FIND OUT THAT I WAS SELLING TO TRUMP WHO WOULD
END UP GETTING A MUCH BETTER DEAL. 
THIS IS WHAT STARTED MY FRIENDSHIP. 
DID SOMETHING I HAD NEVER SEEN  
BEFORE AND THAT I HAVE USED CONSECUTIVELY AFTER THAT. 
HE SAID, LOOK, I WANT TO DO 
THIS. I DON'T KNOW WHAT I SHOULD KNOW.
SO I WILL PAY YOUR BOSS THE PRICE THAT HE WANTS AND I'LL  
CLOSE IT IN ONE WEEK ON ONE CONDITION. YOU, TOM BARRICK, TELL ME 
EVERYTHING THAT I SHOULD KNOW 
THAT I DON'T KNOW.
LOOK, I JUST TOLD YOU, I DON'T KNOW THAT. NO CONTRACT.
YOU AND I SHAKE HANDS RIGHT 
HERE. NO LAWYERS, NO CONTRACT.
YOU JUST TELL ME THE THINGS THAT
I SHOULD KNOW AND HOW TO FIX IT.
AND I'LL DO THIS DEAL.
HE PLAYED ME LINE A STEINWAY PIANO.
I FIXED EVERYTHING IN THE HOTEL.
A WOMAN, 83 YEARS OLD.
HE HAD ME BUY HER A PIANO, DO THE CARPET. 
IT WAS ONE OF THE MOST AMAZING  
THINGS I HAD EVER SEEN. 
HE WAS INCREDIBLE.
BUT HE PRACTICES AN UNBELIEVABLE SET OF DISCIPLINES. 
SO EVERYBODY SAYS, OK, THE MAN IS RICH.
HE'S A CELEBRITY. HE'S POWERFUL.
BUT WHAT IS HE GOING TO DO? 
HOW DOES HE DO IT?
AND HE HAS RELENTLESS HABITS, 
RELENTLESS BEAUTIFUL HABITS. HE SHOWS UP ON TIME. HE BELIEVES THAT PUNKS WALLITY  
IS THE COURTESY OF KINGS. HE DOESN'T CONFUSE EFFORTS WITH RESULTS.
HE BEFRIENDS THE BEWILDERED.
HE PUSHES EVERYBODY AROUND HIM  
INCLUDING YOU THROUGH COMFORT 
BARRIERS THAT THEY NEVER THOUGHT THAT THEY COULD EVER, EVER  
SHATTER. AND HE DOES ALL THIS WITH THE DISCIPLINE OF -- OF AN ANIMAL IN THE JUNGLE. HIS MOTTO IS THAT A LION WAKES UP EVERY MORNING AND KNOWS ONE THING THAT IT HAS RUN FASTER THAN THE FASTEST GAZELLE AND A GAZELLE WAKES UP AND SHE KNOWS  
THAT SHE NEEDS TO RUN FASTER THAN THE FASTEST LION. WHETHER YOU'RE A GAZELLE OR A LION, YOU GET THE HELL GOING. AND THAT IS -- THAT IS DONALD. BUT I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU TWO LITTLE VIGNETTES THAT REALLY  
STUCK IN MY MIND. IT'S NOT FINANCIAL. IT'S NOT HOW RICH HE IS. IT'S NOT HOW A GOOD DEAL GUY HE 
IS. 
I'M TELLING YOU, AFTER 35 YEARS 
BEING WITH A MAN THROUGH THE  
VALLEYS AND UP THE MOUNTAINS, HE
REALLY IS BETTER THAN THE BUILDING YOU SEE, JUST AS AN ADMINISTRATOR, AS AN EXECUTIVE, 
AS A GUY WHO CAN ACTUALLY TAKE  
CARE OF THE PEOPLE THAT WORK ON 
HIM AND BUILD TEAMS.
BUT IT WAS 1989.
I KNOW MANY OF YOU ESPECIALLY 
YOU GIRLS WERE NOT ALIVE THEN.
AND IT WAS A TYSON FIGHT. AND THIS TIME DONALD WAS BIG IN 
ATLANTIC CITY.
HE CALLED ME UP.
HE SAID LET'S GO TO THE TYSON 
FIGHT.
I SAID I HAVE ONE OF THE LITTLE 
SONS WITH ME. 
HE SAID, NO PROBLEM.
I'LL BRING DONNIE IN TYPICAL  
TRUMP STYLE WE JUMP ON THE TRUMP
HELICOPTER. WE FLY INTO ATLANTIC CITY AND 
IT'S A ZOO. THOUSANDS OF PAPARAZZI, 
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE EVERYWHERE. 
WHISK TO HIS LIMB OVEMENT GO TO THE FRONT OF THE CONVENTION CENTER AND THERE'S 10,000 CAMERAS.
HE SAID LET'S GO TO THE BACK OF 
THE CONVENTION CENTER.
WE GO TO THE BACK OF THE  
CONVENTION CENTER.
WE START WALKING IN AND PEOPLE  
ARE HARASSING HIM LIKE MAD. THE SIDE OF THE DOOR THERE'S A LITTLE NONDISSCRIPT MAN. HE SAID MR. TRUMP, MR. TRUMP. 
DONALD STOPS. 
HE WALKS OVER TO THE DOOR.
HE SAID LOUIE. HE SAID MR. TRUMP, THANK YOU FOR WHAT YOU'VE DONE TO MY EMPLOYEES AND FOR ME. I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT MY  
CRITICAL ILL SON THINKS YOU'RE THE BEST IN WORLD.
MEANWHILE EVERYTHING IS GOING ON. 
AND DONALD IS FOCUSED EYE TO EYE
WITH THIS MAN WHO AT THAT MOMENT
THOUGHT HE WAS THE ONLY STAR IN DONALD'S UNIVERSE. HE SAID LOUIE, I'M NOT THE  
GREATEST MAN IN THE WORLD.
YOU ARE. WE TAKE THE KIDS. 
WE ROLL IN. 
IT'S FIVE MINUTES TO THE FIGHT. 
I THINK IT WAS TYSON-HOLMES. ONE OF TYSON'S LONGEST FIGHTS.
WE GET TO THE FLOOR AND HE'S FIDGETTY. 
I'VE GOT THE BOYS. I SAID WHAT'S WRONG? GIVE ME YOUR PROGRAM. I GAVE HIM THE PROGRAM. HE WRITES SOMETHING ON IT.
HE BRINGS ONE OF THE SECURITY GUARDS OVER AND SENDS IT BACK TO
THE DOORMAN. I SAID WHAT WAS THAT? HE SAID I JUST WROTE A NOTE.</span><span class='hidden-full-transcript-ellipses'>...</span></p><a href='#' class='hidden-full-transcript-link'><i class='icon-chevron-down'></i> <span class='link-show-full-text'>Show Full Text</span><i class='icon-chevron-up'></i> <span class='link-show-less-text'>Show Less Text</span></a>

<strong>Unidentified Speaker</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> I SAID WHAT DID THE NOTE SAY. IT WAS TO HIS SON AND SAID I  
CAME HERE TONIGHT TO SEE TWO CHAMPIONS, MIKE TYSON AND YOUR DAD. TRUE STORY. 
[APPLAUSE]<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> NOW, WHAT KIND OF MAN IN THE MIDDLE OF HIS CELEBRITYSHIP HAS 
THE PRESENCE TO FOCUS ON THE LITTLEST GUY IN THE SHOP? AND THAT IS DONALD TRUMP. 
10 YEARS LATER -- 
[APPLAUSE] 10 YEARS LATER, ONE OF THE GREATEST MEN IN DONALD'S LIFE 
PASSED AWAY, FRED TRUMP.
AND THE FUNERAL WAS BEING HELD  
THE NIGHT BEFORE AT THE FRANK 
CAMPBELL FUNERAL HALL, 82ND AND MADISON.
DONALD SAID, I CAN'T STAND IT.
I'M GOING TO GO OVER EARLY. 
WHILE DON'T YOU GO OVER EARLY 
WITH ME.
I SAID FINE.
WE'RE SITTING AS KIND OF, YOU KNOW, TWO MIDDLE AGED GUYS THAT 
GO THROUGH THAT DEBATE WHEN YOUR
FATHER LEAVES. WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN RELEVANCY AND MORTALITY?
RIGHT? THAT LOSS WHERE YOU'RE  
QUESTIONING WHAT'S IMPORTANT AND WHAT'S NOT IMPORTANT AND IT'S NOT ABOUT MONEY AND IT'S NOT  
ABOUT POWER AND IT'S NOT ABOUT  
STUFF.
AND ALL OF THE AGONY THAT YOU 
HAVE WITH YOUR FATHER AT THAT INSTANT JUST EVAPORATES AND 
YOU'RE SITTING THERE WITH SOMETHING. SO HE SAT THERE MUSING. 
I SAID HOW DO YOU FEEL. 
HE SAID, I'M THANKFUL THAT I HAVE MY MOM'S STRENGTH AND MY MOM'S SENSITIVITY.
AND ALL I WANT TO DO IS LEAVE 
THE LEGACY OF THE TRUMP NAME  
THAT THEY BUILT A LITTLE BIT  
BETTER THAN I FOUND IT. HE'S DONE IT. 
[APPLAUSE] SO LOOK.
WE'RE AT A TIPPING POINT. 
THE WORLD IS IN MASS JUST 
NECKLESS OF GLOBALISM THAT WE TALKED ABOUT HAS CRUMBLED AND SHATTER INTO A THOUSAND CHARDS. 
IT NEEDS A JEWELER TO TAKE EACH OF THOSE JEWELS ONE BY ONE STARTING AMERICA, ITS OWN DIAMOND AND POLISH IT. THEN SLOWLY FIND SEAMLESS 
STRENGTH AND PEW THEM ALL BACK  
TOGETHER. SO WHAT WE LOOK AT IS THE NECKLACE OF PROSPERITY AND  
TOLERANCE AARON THE WORLD.
-- AROUND THE WORLD.
WE'VE BEEN ON AN ADVENTURE AND  
PEOPLE SAY, WOW, DONALD TRUMP,  
IT'S LIKE A MISHNER TAIL FROM 
BUSINESSMAN, TO CELEBRITY, TO FATHER TO POTENTIALLY PRESIDENT 
OF THE UNITED STATES, AND I SAY 
TO YOU, IT IS A TALE. BUT IT IS A TAIL. IT'S TO MAKE ONCE UPON A TIME,  
ONCE UPON THIS TIME.
THANK YOU.
