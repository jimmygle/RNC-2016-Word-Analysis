<strong>Unidentified Speaker</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> MY NAME IS LISA SHIN AND I
DEEPLY HUMBLED AND HONORED TO
SPEAK TO YOU AS A NATIONAL
DELEGATE FROM THE GREAT STATE OF NEW MEXICO.
[CHEERING] I AM A<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> CHRISTIAN, A WIFE, AND A
MOTHER. HAVE BEEN IN PRIVATE PRACTICE AS AN OPTOMETRIST FOR THE PAST 19 YEARS. I AM A KOREAN AMERICAN. I AM VERY PROUD TO BE A
SUPPORTER OF THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, DONALD J TRUMP.
[CHEERING] OVER 40 YEARS AGO, MY PARENTS LEFT SOUTH KOREA TO COME TO AMERICA. THEY KNEW THAT AMERICA WAS AN EXCEPTIONAL AND GENEROUS COUNTRY
WERE IMMIGRANTS COULD BECOME AMERICAN CITIZENS.
[CHEERING] PARTICIPATE IN AMERICAN DEMOCRACY AND LIVE THE AMERICAN DREAM.
[CHEERING] THEY KNEW AMERICA WAS THE LAND
OF OPPORTUNITY AND FREEDOM WHERE
IMMIGRANTS COULD SUCCEED AND
PROSPER. SO THEY SWORE AN OATH TO SUPPORT AND DEFEND THE CONSTITUTION.
[CHEERING] MY PARENTS ENDURED COUNTLESS HARDSHIPS AND MADE TREMENDOUS SACRIFICES TO PURSUE THE DREA AND THEY NEVER IMAGINED THAT ONE
DAY THEIR DAUGHTER WOULD BE
SPEAKING TO YOU TODAY. THIS IS THE BEAUTY OF THE AMERICAN DREAM.
[CHEERING] TO DO AND BE THE UNIMAGINABLE.
[CHEERING] HILLARY CLINTON IS A DIRECT THREAT TO THE AMERICAN DREAM.
[CHEERING] HER PROPOSALS WOULD BE UTTERLY
DEVASTATING TO OUR ECONOMY. HER DANGEROUS IDEOLOGY UNDERMINES OUR DEMOCRACY AND FREEDOM. SHE REPRESENTS EVERYTHING THAT
IS WRONG WITH THE SYSTEM.
[CHEERING] THE DECEIT, CORRUPTION, CRONYISM
AND A TOTAL LACK OF
ACCOUNTABILITY.
[CHEERING] WITH EXTREME CARELESSNESS SHE
HAS COMPROMISED OUR NATIONAL SECURITY AND OUR SAFETY.
[CHEERING] WITH CONTEMPT, SHE HAS FLOUTED THE RULE OF LAW THAT WE RELY ON FOR JUSTICE AND ORDER AND PEACE. SHE IS OVERWHELMINGLY LOST THE
TRUST OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. SHE IS NOT QUALIFIED TO BE OUR NEXT PRESIDENT.
SHE IS UNFIT TO BE THE
COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF OF THE BRAVE MEN AND WOMEN WHO SACRIFICED SO
MUCH TO FIGHT FOR OUR COUNTRY.
[CHEERING] THERE IS ONLY ONE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE WILL PRESERVE THE AMERICAN DREAM THAT OUR PARENTS
AND GRANDPARENTS ENVISIONED FOR
US. THERE IS ONLY ONE CANDIDATE WHO
WILL ENSURE A MORE PROSPEROUS AND SAFE AND SECURE FUTURE FOR
OUR CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN. THERE IS ONLY ONE CANDIDATE WHO WILL DEFEND THE CORE PRINCIPLES THAT THIS GREAT COUNTRY WAS
FOUNDED UPON. THERE'S ONLY ONE CANDIDATE WHO
WILL PROTECT, STAND WITH, AND FIGHT FOR WE, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE.
[CHEERING] THERE IS ONLY ONE CLEAR CHOICE FOR AMERICA AND THAT CHOICES
DONALD J TRUMP.
[CHEERING] THANK YOU.
