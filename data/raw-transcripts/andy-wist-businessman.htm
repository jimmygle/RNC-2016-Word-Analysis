<strong>Andrew Wist</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> THANK YOU. IT'S GREAT TO BE HERE. IT HAS BEEN FUN WATCHING THE
MEDIA SPECULATE ABOUT ME.
WHO IS ANDY WIST? SOMEONE SAYS I WAS THAT MEN. I SAID THAT<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> WAS ADAM WEST. SOME OF THESE REPORTERS NEED TO
GET A LIFE. DO YOU WANT TO KNOW WHO ENDED WIST -- ANDY WIST IS? I AM PROOF THAT THE AMERICAN
DREAM IS REAL. I STARTED A BUSINESS IN MY
MOTHER'S BACKYARD WHEN I WAS 21
YEARS OLD. STANDARD WATERPROOFING. WE RESTORE BUILDING EXTERIORS.
TODAY WE HAVE A HUNDRED 40
EMPLOYEES. NOT AS GOOD AS MR. TRUMP'S COMPANY, BUT STILL PRETTY GOOD
RIGHT?
[APPLAUSE] I AM ALSO THE TRUSTEE OF THE
LOCAL 522. LIKE DONALD TRUMP AND MIKE PENCE, I BELIEVE THAT WORKING
MEN AND WOMEN STILL MATTER IN
THIS COUNTRY. WE HAVE TO LOOK OUT FOR THEM.
[APPLAUSE] AFTER EIGHT YEARS OF PRESIDENT OBAMA, I DON'T SEE THE AMERICAN DREAM LIKE I DID WHEN I WAS
STARTING OUT. ALL I SEE IS TOO MANY PEOPLE OUT OF WORK, TOO MANY JOBS SHIFT OVERSEAS, AND TOO MANY COEFFICIENTS THAT DO NOT CARE -- POLITICIANS THAT DO NOT CARE. GOOGLE FIX IT? HILLARY CLINTON?
-- WHO WILL FIX IT? HILLARY
CLINTON? HER ONLY A COMPLIMENT IS BEATING THE RAP EVERY TIME SHE BEATS -- BREAKS THE LAW.
[APPLAUSE] DONALD TRUMP IS A BUILDER. HE IS A LEADER THAT WILL BRING US TOGETHER. HE WILL MAKE AMERICA WORK AGAIN SO THAT WE CAN BELIEVE AGAIN. I AM NOT A BIG IMPORTANT PERSON. I AM JUST A REGULAR GUY. I LOVE MY COUNTRY AND HAVE LIVED A GREAT LIFE. I'M NOT GOING TO BE AROUND
FOREVER AND NEITHER WILL YOU. THIS NOVEMBER WE GET TO DECIDE WHAT KIND OF WORLD WE LIVE
BEHIND. WHEN I AM GONE I WANT MY
CHILDREN AND YOUR CHILDREN AND OUR GRANDCHILDREN TO BE ABLE TO
LIVE THE AMERICAN DREAM LIKE I
HAVE. AND THE ONLY WAY WE KEEP THE
AMERICAN DREAM ALIVE IS BY ELECTING DONALD TRUMP PRESIDENT. THANK YOU. GOD BLESS DONALD TRUMP AND GOD
BLESS AMERICA.
