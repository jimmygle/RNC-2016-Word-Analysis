<p class='short_transcript'> DANA WHITE: WHAT'S UP, G.O.P.?
MY NAME IS DANA WHITE.
I'M THE PRESIDENT OF THE  
ULTIMATE FIGHTING CHAMPIONSHIP. 
THANK YOU. I'M SURE MOST OF YOU ARE<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'>  
WONDERING, WHAT ARE YOU

I AM NOT A POLITICIAN, I AM A
FIGHT PROMOTER. BUT I AM HONORED TO BE HERE
TONIGHT. I WANTED TO SHOW UP AND TELL YOU
ABOUT MY FRIEND, DONALD TRUMP. THE DONALD TRUMP THAT I KNOW. IN 2001, MY PARTNERS AND I BOUGHT UFC. IT WAS CONSIDERED A BLOODSPORT. THE STATE ATHLETIC COMMISSION DID NOT SUPPORT US. ARENAS REFUSED TO HOST OUR
EVENTS. NOBODY TOOK US SERIOUSLY, NOBODY. EXCEPT DONALD TRUMP.
[APPLAUSE] DONALD WAS THE FIRST GUY THAT
RECOGNIZED THE POTENTIAL THAT WE
SAW IN THE UFC AND ENCOURAGED US
TO BUILD OUR BUSINESS. THE HOSTED OUR FIRST 2 EVENTS AT HIS VENUE, DON'T WITH US PERSONALLY, GOT IN THE TRENCHES,
AND MADE A DEAL THAT WORKED FOR EVERYONE.
ON TOP OF THAT, HE SHOWED UP FOR THE FIGHT ON SATURDAY NIGHT AND SAT IN THE FRONT ROW. YEAH. HE IS THAT GUY THAT SHOWS
UP. DONALD CHAMPIONED THE UFC BEFORE
IT WAS POPULAR, BEFORE IT GREW
INTO A SUCCESSFUL BUSINESS. AND I WILL ALWAYS BE GRATEFUL, SO GRATEFUL TO HIM FOR STANDING WITH US IN THOSE EARLY DAYS. TONIGHT I STAND WITH DONALD
TRUMP.
[APPLAUSE] LET ME TELL YOU THREE THINGS
THAT I RESPECT ABOUT THIS MAN. FIRST, DONALD HAD GREAT BUSINESS
INSTINCTS. HE SUPPORTS BUSINESSES OF ALL
SIZES. HE WILL MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR
THEM TO GROW AND SUCCEED, WHICH
IS THE BACKBONE OF A STRONG
ECONOMY. SECOND, DONALD IS A HARD WORKER.
HE WILL WORK WITH PEOPLE. HE WILL PUT IN THE TIME TO GET
THINGS DONE. THIRD, FOR OVER 15 YEARS, DONALD
TRUMP HAS BEEN A LOYAL AND SUPPORTIVE FRIEND. I KNOW THAT IF I NEEDED DONALD,
HE WOULD BE THERE FOR ME JUST
LIKE YOU WAS WHEN I FIRST MET HIM.
THESE ONE OF THOSE GUYS THAT SOMETIMES HE WILL CALL ME AND
SAY, GOOD LUCK WITH THE FIGHT
TONIGHT, I WILL BE WATCHING. AND HE ALWAYS REACHES OUT TO ME WHEN SOMETHING HAS HAPPENED IN MY CAREER. BACK IN 2011 WE SIGNED A HUGE NETWORK TV DEAL WITH FOX. THEY DID A BIG RIGHT UP IN THE
NEW YORK TIMES.
DONALD WROTE ON THE FRONT OF THE PAPER "CONGRATULATIONS DANA, I
ALWAYS KNEW YOU WERE GOING TO DO
IT." ODONALD HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH MY BUSINESS.
HIS INTEREST IN MY BUSINESS IS
PERSONAL. IN MY OPINION, YOU CAN TELL A
PERSON'S TRUE CHARACTER WHEN
THEY ARE HAPPY FOR SOMEONE ELSE'S SUCCESS.
[APPLAUSE] I THINK THAT SENSE OF LOYALTY AND COMMITMENT WILL TRANSLATE
INTO HOW HE WILL RUN THIS
COUNTRY. LET'S BE HONEST, WE NEED SOMEONE WHO BELIEVES, IS PROUD OF, AND
WILL FIGHT FOR THIS COUNTRY.
[APPLAUSE] I HAVE BEEN IN THE FIGHT
BUSINESS MY WHOLE LIFE. I KNOW FIGHTERS. LADIES AND ROMAN, DONALD TRUMP
IS A FIGHTER, AND I KNOW HE WILL
FIGHT FOR THIS COUNTRY.
[APPLAUSE] THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
HAVE A GREAT.
-- A GREAT EVENING.</span><span class='hidden-full-transcript-ellipses'>...</span></p><a href='#' class='hidden-full-transcript-link'><i class='icon-chevron-down'></i> <span class='link-show-full-text'>Show Full Text</span><i class='icon-chevron-up'></i> <span class='link-show-less-text'>Show Less Text</span></a>
