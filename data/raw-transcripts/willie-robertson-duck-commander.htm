<strong>Willie Robertson</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> WHEW! Y'ALL FIRED UP? THANK YOU SO MUCH.
I'M SO HONORED TO BE HERE.
AS SOME OF YOU KNOW, WE AND
EVERY EPISODE OF DR. DENNIS AND WITH A -- DUCK DYNASTY<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> WITH A
FAMILY PRAYER AT THE DINNER
TABLE. I KNOW WE JUST SAID ONE THAT I'M
GOING TO THROW ONE MORE UP WITH
THE WAY THINGS ARE GOING IN THIS
COUNTRY. FATHER, WE ARE SOMETHING FOR HIM
WAS TO BE IN THIS COUNTRY. WHILE THE, WE WANT TO PRAY THAT
YOU KEEP US SAFE. I MINDFUL OF MY BROTHERS AND
SISTERS IN LOUISIANA. BE WITH US IN THE PAINT. WE LOVE YOU AND JESUS. AMEN.
>> AMEN!
>> I'VE ALWAYS SAID THAT ME AND
MR. TRUMP HAVE THREE THINGS IN
COMMON. WERE BOTH SUCCESSFUL BUSINESSMAN. ALTHOUGH I FLEW COMMERCIAL HERE
SO I'M GUESSING HE DID NOT.
[LAUGHTER] WE BOTH HAVE HAD HIT TELEVISION SHOWS. AND WE BOTH HAVE INTELLIGENT
WIVES WERE MUCH BETTER THAN/ -- MUCH BETTER LOOKING THAN WE ARE. ARE YOU CHEERING BECAUSE WERE UGLY? IT HAS BEEN A ROUGH YEAR FOR THE NEEDY EXPERTS.
-- MEDIA EXPERT.
IT MUST BE HUMBLING TO BE SO
WRONG ABOUT SO MUCH FOR SO LONG.
[LAUGHTER] BUT I HAVE A THEORY ABOUT HOW THEY MISSED THE TRUMP TRAIN. THEY DON'T HANG OUT WITH REGULAR
FOLKS LIKE US.
WHO LIKE TO HUNT AND FISH AND PRAY AND ACTUALLY WORK FOR A LIVING.
[CHEERING] HECK, I DON'T EVEN THINK BEEN A
HOW TO TALK TO PEOPLE FROM
MIDDLE AMERICA. WHEN I TELL THEM I'M FROM
LOUISIANA, THEY START TALKING
REAL SLOW AND REAL LOUD.
[LAUGHTER] LET ME TELL YOU WHY I HAVE BEEN
ON THE TRUMP TRAIN FROM THE BEGINNING, WHEN YOU ARE FROM THE
SOUTH AND TO GROW UP WITH REDNECKS, THERE ARE SOME OCCASIONAL DISAGREEMENTS. SOMETIMES THOSE DISAGREEMENTS TURNED INTO FISTICUFFS. BUT ANY TIME I WAS EVER IN A BAD SPOT, I ALWAYS KNEW MY BROTHERS
WOULD HAVE MY BACK. AND TODAY, AND A LOT OF WAYS,
AMERICA IS IN A BAD SPOT. AND WE NEED A PRESIDENT WHO WILL
HAVE OUR BACK.
[CHEERING] I CAN PROMISE YOU THIS, NO
MATTER WHO YOU ARE, DONALD TRUMP WILL HAVE YOUR BACK. IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A JOB OR TRYING TO GROW A BUSINESS, DONALD TRUMP WILL HAVE YOUR BACK.
[CHEERING] IF YOU ARE A SERVICEMEN FIGHTING
OVERSEAS OR A COP WHO IS RISKING
THEIR LIFE TO HELP US STAY SAFE
AT HOME, DONALD TRUMP WILL HAVE
YOUR BACK.
[CHEERING] IF YOU'RE AN AVERAGE AMERICAN
WHO FEELS LIKE YOU HAVE BEEN FORGOTTEN, NEGLECTED BY FAR WAY LEADERS, THAT THE DECK IS
STACKED AGAINST YOU AND YOU
CAN'T WIN, DONALD TRUMP WILL
HAVE YOUR BACK.
[CHEERING] NOW HE MAY NOT ALWAYS TELL YOU
WHAT YOU WANT TO HEAR. YOU MAY NOT ALWAYS AGREE. AND IT MAY NOT ALWAYS BE POLITICALLY CORRECT. BUT WHEN YOUR FATHER IS BILL
ROBINSON, I'M USED TO THAT. I WILL SAY THIS, DONALD TRUMP WILL ALWAYS HAVE, HE WILL ALWAYS
TELL YOU THE TRUTH AS HE SEES
IT. AND THAT IS WHY WE CAN TRUST HIM
TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN AS
OUR NEXT PRESIDENT. THANK YOU AND GOD BLESS YOU!
