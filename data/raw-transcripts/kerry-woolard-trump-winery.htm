<p class='short_transcript'> >> GOOD EVENING.
IT'S SUCH AN HONOR TO BE HERE TO
SPEAK TO YOU ABOUT OUR NEXT
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. DONALD TRUMP IS A MAN OF VISION.
HE ISN'T<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> A WIDE-EYED DREAMER BUT SOMEONE WHO SEES THINGS OTHERS DON'T AND TURNS THAT VISION INTO REALITY, MAKING LIFE BETTER FOR PEOPLE AND COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE NATION.
I HAVE EXPERIENCED THIS FIRSTHAND AT THE TRUMP WINERY AND HOTEL. WHEN DONALD TRUMP PURCHASED THE WINERY IN 2011, IT WAS IN RECEIVERSHIP. HE WENT TO WORK BUILDING THE HOTEL, REPLANTING THE VINES, AND
MAKING IT A WORLD-CLASS DESTINATION AND THE LARGEST
VINEYARD IN VIRGINIA.
[APPLAUSE] TODAY, WE EMPLOY MORE THAN 100 PEOPLE AND SUPPORT COUNTLESS OTHER ENTREPRENEURS, CONTRACTORS, SUPPLIERS IN THE REGION. WE GENERATE MILLIONS IN REVENUE AND TAXES WITH A $50 MILLION ECONOMIC IMPACT THAT FURTHER SUSTAINS AND STRENGTHENS THE
COMMUNITY IN WHICH OUR EMPLOYEES AND I WAS -- LIVE. NEARLY 100% SALES GROWTH IN JUST
FIVE YEARS. I HAVEN'T JUST SEEN THIS HAPPEN, I'VE HELPED MAKE IT HAPPEN AND I
CAN TELL YOU, IT WOULD NOT HAVE
HAPPENED WITHOUT DONALD TRUMP AND HIS FAMILY.
[APPLAUSE] LET ME BE CLEAR -- THIS WAS NOT
EASY AND IT WAS NOT INEVITABLE. IT TOOK A TEAM OF HARD-WORKING, DEDICATED EMPLOYEES, BUT IT
TAKES MORE THAN HARD WORK ALONE. OUR SUCCESS WOULD NOT HAVE COME WITHOUT THE LEADERSHIP AND THE
VISION OF THE TRUMPS. WHAT YOU DON'T SEE IS WHEN DONALD TRUMP LISTENS. HE AND HIS SON LISTEN
ATTENTIVELY AND ASK QUESTIONS
THAT LEAD TO ENGAGED DECISIONS BASED ON THE EXPERT KNOWLEDGE OF
THOSE WHO HAVE EARNED THEIR
TRUST. THAT TRUST IS REWARDED NOT JUST
WITH COMPENSATION BUT AUTHORITY AND RESOURCES.THE TRUMPS HAVE GIVEN A GIFT TO THOSE WHO KNOW THEM, AND APPROACH AND
OUTLOOK TO LIFE AND THAT WILL
ALWAYS GUIDE ME. BECAUSE OF THEM, I THINK BIGGER
AND IN WAYS I DIDN'T THINK WERE EVEN POSSIBLE. DONALD TRUMP HAS TOLD ME A
PERSON'S OWN WORK ETHIC AND
DRIVE ARE THE ONLY LIMITATIONS TO SUCCESS.
[APPLAUSE]
[APPLAUSE] I NOW KNOW THIS TO BE TRUE. IT ISN'T JUST A PLATITUDE. AT TRUMP WHINING ARRAY, IT IS REAL AND IT IS RARE. IT IS ACCOMPANIED BY RESPECT FOR
MY ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND THE OPPORTUNITY TO GROW PROFESSIONALLY. THAT IS A DIRECT RESULT OF TRUMPS LEADERSHIP, LEADERSHIP WE NEED MORE TODAY, MORE THAN EVER
IN OUR COUNTRY. THANK YOU.
[APPLAUSE]
(music)
>> PLEASE WELCOME DONALD TRUMP JUNIOR.
