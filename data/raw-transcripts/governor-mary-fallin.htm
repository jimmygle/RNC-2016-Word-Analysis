<strong>Unidentified Speaker</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> OKLAHOMA LOVES NEW YORK, TOO! THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT, AMERICA. ARE YOU READY FOR CHANGE? ME TOO! I GREW UP IN A SMALL TOWN IN
OKLAHOMA. IT WAS ONE OF<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> THOSE ALL-AMERICAN
TOWNS WHERE EVERYONE WATCHES
HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL ON FRIDAY
NIGHT AND NEIGHBORS TAKE CARE OF NEIGHBORS.
WE UNDERSTOOD POVERTY. BUT IT WAS NOT A DESTINY THAT WAS INEVITABLE, WE WERE
OPTIMISTIC ABOUT OUR FUTURE AND
WE KNEW WE COULD SUCCEED WITH HARD WORK, A GOOD EDUCATION AND
FAITH IN GOD.
[CHEERING] THERE WEREN'T VERY MANY OPPORTUNITIES ARE YOUNG WOMEN,
BUT WE DID HAVE A RATE ROLE MODEL, A WOMAN THERE, MY MOM.
-- MAYOR, MY MOM.
[CHEERING] SHE TAUGHT ME THAT IF I WORKED HARD, I COULD BE ANYTHING. AND I TOOK THAT LESSON TO HEART
AND EVENTUALLY BECAME THE FIRST FEMALE GOVERNOR OF THE STATE OF OKLAHOMA.
[CHEERING] IN MY COMMUNITY, THERE WAS A SENSE OF OPTIMISM AND DETERMINATION THAT OUR COMMUNITY AND OUR COUNTRY COULD BE BETTER. FOR EVERYONE. IT EVEN AT A TIME WHEN THE
SHADOW OF INSTITUTIONAL
DISCRIMINATION FELL OVER MUCH OF OUR COUNTRY, THERE WAS NO SHORTAGE OF AFRICAN-AMERICAN HEROES, BLACK OKLAHOMANS LIGHT CIVIL RIGHTS LEADER CLAY LOOPER
IT WAS SUCCESSFULLY INTEGRATING
SCHOOLS ACROSS THE STATE AND
WINNING THE FIGHT FOR RESPECT
AND OPPORTUNITY.
[CHEERING] WHEN I LOOK BACK ON MY
CHILDHOOD, MY AMERICA, I DON'T SEE A PERFECT PLACE, BUT WE WERE UNITED BY A SIMPLE BELIEF THAT
NO MATTER WHO YOU WERE OR WHERE YOU CAME FROM, BETTER DAYS WERE
AHEAD FOR AMERICA.
[CHEERING] TODAY, I'M AFRAID WE ARE LOSING THAT SENSE OF UNITY AND
OPTIMISM. NOT JUST IN TOWNS LIKE TECUMSEH,
BUT ACROSS THIS LAND. OUR COUNTRY IS DIVIDED. OUR PEOPLE ARE AFRAID. AND OUR SPIRITS ARE NEARLY
BROKEN. BUT WE CAN'T LOSE THAT HOPELESSNESS AND HAVE IT BECOME
THE NEW NORMAL. IN AMERICA, WE WILL NOT.
[CHEERING] I BELIEVE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE LONGING FOR THE AMERICAN DREAM WHERE THEY CAN GET A FAIR
SHAKE IN LIFE AND AN OPPORTUNITY TO SUCCEED. WE MUST MAKE AMERICA ONE AGAIN
AND RESTORE THE STRENGTH OF OUR NATION.
[CHEERING] AND IT IS NO SECRET, DONALD TRUMP IS BOLD, TENACIOUS, COURAGEOUS AND EVEN AN OUTSPOKEN LEADER.
[CHEERING] AND HE KNOWS HOW TO CREATE JOBS
AND SUCCESSFUL BUSINESSES. HE HAS BOLD IDEAS AND HE SPEAKS TRUTH TO POWER. HE IS A MAN WHO WILL GET THIS COUNTRY ON THE RIGHT TRACK, WHO BELIEVES IN PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH AND WILL PROTECT
AMERICA AGAINST RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISTS WHO STREAK -- SEE TO
DESTROY OUR NATION.
[CHEERING] OUR COUNTRY HAS UNITED TIME AND TIME AGAIN ON OUR CORE VALUES. READ HIM, INDIVIDUAL LIBERTY AND
JUSTICE FOR ALL PEOPLE. THE PRINCIPLES WHICH MADE OUR COUNTRY GREAT AND WHICH IT WAS
FOUNDED UPON. DONALD TRUMP UNAPOLOGETICALLY
STANDS FOR THOSE VALUES.
[CHEERING] WE ARE ONE IN OUR BELIEF THAT
AMERICA MUST ADDRESS THE NATIONAL DEBT, NOT BY INCREASING
TAXES, BUT BY INCREASING OPPORTUNITIES.
[CHEERING] WE ARE ONE IN OUR BELIEF THAT WE
MUST PROTECT OUR BORDERS AND
PROMOTE FAIR TRADE THAT PUTS
AMERICAN WORKERS FIRST.
[CHEERING] AND WE ARE ONE IN OUR BELIEF
THAT WE MUST STAND WITH OUR
ALLIES LIKE ISRAEL, A BEACON OF
FREEDOM AND DEMOCRACY IN THE
MIDDLE EAST.
[CHEERING] AND WE ARE ONE IN OUR BELIEF
THAT WE MUST RESPECT OUR
MILITARY, VETERANS, AND LAW ENFORCEMENT WHO SACRIFICE KEEPS US SAFE AND FREE.
[CHEERING] AND WE ARE ONE IN OUR BELIEF THAT EVERY LIFE IS PRECIOUS REGARDLESS OF RACE AND FAITH AND
INCLUDING THE LIVES OF UNBORN
CHILDREN.
[CHEERING] AS A PARTY, WE DON'T AGREE 100% ON EVERYTHING, THAT IS OK.
WE DON'T HAVE TO. AS RONALD REAGAN ONCE SAID, THE
PERSON WHO AGREES TO DO 80% OF
-- AGREES WITH YOU 80% OF THE
TIME AS A FRIEND AND ALLY. BY EVERY AMERICAN WHO BELIEVES
IN THESE PRINCIPLES AND LONGS FOR AN END TO DIVISION AND WANTS TO MAKE AMERICA ONE AGAIN TO JOIN US IN ELECTING DONALD TRUMP AS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.
[CHEERING] THANK YOU AND MAY GOD BLESS YOU
ALL.
GOD BLESS AMERICA!
