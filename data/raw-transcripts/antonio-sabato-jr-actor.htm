<strong>Antonio Sabato Jr.</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> GOOD EVENING. I MONITORED TO BE HERE. THIS NOVEMBER WE'RE GOING TO
WIN.
[CHEERING] I KNOW I'M NOT YOUR TYPICAL
CONVENTION SPEAKER. YOU MIGHT BE WONDERING<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> WHY I
CHOSE TO SPEAK.
THE TRUTH IS, I NEVER CONSIDER
MYSELF VERY POLITICAL OR SPOKEN
OUT POLITICALLY BEFORE. MY BELIEF IN THIS COUNTRY, MY
FAITH IN JESUS CHRIST HAVE COMPELLED ME TO SPEAK NOW.
THAT IS RIGHT.
[CHEERING] I'M CONCERNED ABOUT OUR COUNTRY'S FUTURE.
I'M CONCERNED ABOUT MY
CHILDREN'S FUTURE AND I BELIEVE
WHEN HE DONALD TRUMP -- WE NEED DONALD TRUMP WHO SHARES MY BELIEFS, MY FAITH, TO GET OUR
COUNTRY BACK ON TRACK. IN THE PAST EIGHT YEARS, FAILED POLICIES HAVE CAUSED OUR COUNTRY
TO DETERIORATE. ALL RIGHTS HAVE BEEN THREATENED. WE ARE WEAKER BUT EVERY MEASURE.
WE ARE ON THE WRONG PATH. IT IS CLEAR TO SOMEONE WHO IS
NOT EVEN BORN HERE, I CAME TO THE UNITED STATES FROM ROME, ITALY IN 1985.
[CHEERING] I FOLLOW ALL THE RULES AND FINALLY BECAME A NATURALIZED CITIZEN IN 1996.
[CHEERING] THAT'S RIGHT. OTHERS, WHO WANT TO COME TO THE
U.S. TO LIVE AND WORK SHOULD FOLLOW THE SAME RULES.
[CHEERING] THAT'S RIGHT. WE ARE A NATION OF LAWS FOR A
REASON.
THERE SHOULD BE NO SHORTCUTS FOR
THOSE WHO DON'T WANT TO PAY OR
WAIT. MY MOTHER WAS BORN IN COMMUNIST
BROCK, SKIP IT -- PRAGUE, AND MET MY DEBT OF ITALY.
I KNOW A SOCIALISM LOOKS LIKE
AND I DON'T WANT THAT FOR MY
CHILDREN. NOT AT ALL. THAT IS THE PAST.
-- PATH.
THAT IS THE PATH WE ARE HEADED
DOWN WITH THE LEADER WE HAVE IN THE CANDIDATE HE ENDORSES. BARACK OBAMA AND HILLARY CLINTON PROMOTE DIVISION.
DON'T BE FULL.
-- FULL TO. DONALD TRUMP IS FOR UNITY.
-- FOOLED. DONALD TRUMP IS FOR UNITY.
[CHEERING] DONALD TRUMP LEAVES IN -- BELIEVES IN ONE AMERICA WITH
LIBERTY AND JUSTICE FOR ALL. HAVING SECURE BORDERS, PROTECTING THE CITIZENS, NONE OF THIS IS HATEFUL. THIS IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF
THE GOVERNMENT.
[CHEERING] THAT'S RIGHT. IT IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO. DONALD TRUMP WILL GET IT DONE
AND PUT US BACK ON THE RIGHT TRACK.
PEOPLE KNOW THIS AND THAT IS WHY THEY HAVE VOTED AS THEY HAD. WE CAN NO LONGER AFFORD TO BE
SILENT.
OUR COUNTRY NEEDS DONALD TRUMP TO MAKE IS GREAT AGAIN.
[CHEERING] GOD BLESS YOU AND GOD BLESS THE
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA!
