<strong>Bill Schuette</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> GOOD AFTERNOON. I'M YOUR ON-DUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL THE GREAT STATE OF
MICHIGAN. LET ME TELL YOU A STORY ABOUT MY STATE IN A CITY CALLED FLINT,
WHERE<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> THE WATER WAS POISONED
FROM LEAD. I VISITED A PASTOR THERE AND INSIDE HIS CHURCH WERE STACKS
AND STACKS OF WHAT WHITE BECAUSE
HIS CONGREGATION COULD NOT DRINK
FROM THE TAP OR USE THEIR
SHOWER. PREGNANT MOTHERS AND MOTHERS WITH NEWBORNS STILL SHOULD NOT
RAISE OR DRINK THE WATER.
AND THAT IS NOT RIGHT, BUT I
WILL MAKE IT RIGHT BECAUSE IN
MICHIGAN, THE SYSTEM IS NOT RIGGED.
IN MICHIGAN, WE HAVE ONE SYSTEM OF JUSTICE THAT MEANS THE RULES
APPLY TO ALL, NO MATTER WHO YOU
ARE. THE FAMILIES OF WENT HAVE NOT
RECEIVED JUSTICE, BUT I CAN PROMISE THAT JUSTICE IS COMING TO FLINT.
[APPLAUSE] I'M ALSO CHAIRMAN OF THE
REPUBLICAN ATTORNEYS GENERAL ASSOCIATION. 27 WOMEN AND MEN DEDICATED TO DEFENDING THE CONSTITUTION AND UPHOLDING THE RULE OF LAW. WE WORK SIDE BY THOSE ON THE
FRONT LINES OF THE LAW, WHICH LEADS ME TO ANOTHER STORY ABOUT
MICHIGAN. JUST DAYS AGO, TO COURT OFFICERS
WERE KILLED IN THE LINE OF DUTY.
THESE BRAVE MEN DIED JUST FIVE
DAYS AFTER POLICE OFFICERS WERE
SLAIN IN DALLAS. RONALD REAGAN CALLED AMERICA A
SPECIAL LAND, SITUATED BETWEEN TWO GREAT OCEANS, INHABITED BY PEOPLE WHAT THEY LOVE OF
FREEDOM, FAITH AND PEACE. SCRIPTURE SAID BLESSED ARE THE
PEACEMAKERS, BUT THE TRUTH IS, WE ARE ALL CALLED TO BE
PEACEMAKERS AND PEACE STARTS WITH US, WHEREVER WE MAY LIVE, FROM DETROIT TO DALLAS, FROM
MARIAN TO BATON ROUGE AND WE CAN
START BY HONORING THE
PEACEMAKERS AMONG US. LET'S THAN THEN RECOGNIZE THE
BRAVE MEN AND WOMEN WHO SERVE
AND PROTECT. LET'S STAND WITH THE POLICE AND SHERIFFS DEPUTIES WHO UNDERSTAND
COURAGE AND HONOR. LET'S STAND WITH THE YOUNG MOTHER IN A CITY WHOSE CHILDREN
HUNGER FOR THIRST AND LET'S STAND WITH THE PARENTS WHOSE ONE DESIRE IS THAT THEIR CHILDREN
CAN GO TO SCHOOL SAFELY AND
LEARN TO READ AND FIND THE PATH TO THE SHINING CITY ON THE HILL. WHEN WE STAND WITH THEM, WHEN WE STAND WITH EACH OTHER, WE STAND
WITH THE VERY BEST AMERICA HAS
TO OFFER IN THIS LAND OF FREEDOM, A AND PEACE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU.
