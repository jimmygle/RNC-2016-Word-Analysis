<strong>Ray Valdes</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> GOOD AFTERNOON. IT'S AN HONOR FOR ME TO ADDRESS YOU, REPRESENTING ALL REPUBLICAN COUNTY A LOOK AT OFFICIALS
ACROSS AMERICA. ON BEHALF OF THE NATIONAL<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> CONFERENCE OF REPUBLICAN COUNTY OFFICIALS, WE BELIEVE THE MOST
EFFECTIVE GOVERNMENT IS THE ONE
CLOSEST TO THE PEOPLE, COUNTY
ELECTED OFFICERS. IN MY MID-FLORIDA COUNTY,
REPUBLICAN VOTER REGISTRATION HAS NEVER ACHIEVED A MAJORITY IN
100 YEARS, YET ALL OF OUR COUNTY
ALIKE IT OFFICERS ARE
REPUBLICAN. WHY IS THAT?
BECAUSE WE ATTRACT THE INDEPENDENT VOTERS AND THOSE IN
THE CONSERVATIVE DEMOCRATIC FAMILY VALUES GROUP HELP US WIN
GENERAL ELECTIONS. VOTERS KNOW LOCAL OFFICIALS CARRY OUT THEIR RESPONSIBILITY WITH EFFICIENCY AND WITHIN OUR
FINANCIAL RESOURCES. EACH OF US UNDERSTAND THE THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO MUST BE TREATED
WITH DIGNITY AND THEIR OPINION MUST BE HEARD AND RESPECTED. WHAT WE DO IN FLORIDA IS DUPLICATED BY OTHER TOWN D
OFFICIALS ACROSS THE COUNTRY. WE TREAT OUR PEOPLE WITH RESPECT, WE ARE RECEPTIVE TO NEW IDEAS, YET WITHOUT COMPROMISE OF
OUR CORE PRINCIPLES AND MORAL
VALUES. LET US AS DELEGATES CONFIRM IN
OUR PLATFORM THAT WE ARE THE
ONLY POLITICAL PARTY OF THE
PEOPLE AND FOR THE PEOPLE.
IN NOVEMBER, BUT WHAT YOU KNOW
IS THE RIGHT CHOICE FOR OUR
COUNTIES AND COUNTRY. VOTE REPUBLICAN.

<strong>Unidentified Speaker</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> IT'S NOT ABOUT US AS ELECTED
OFFICIALS, IT'S ABOUT THE PEOPLE
WE REPRESENT. YES, GOVERNMENT NEEDS TO GET OUT
OF THE WAY, LET US BE
SUCCESSFUL, LET<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> US HIRE MORE
PEOPLE AND GIVE MORE OPPORTUNITIES TO THOSE AND JOBS
TO THOSE WHO NEED THEM. WE ARE WORKING EXTREMELY HARD TO MAKE NEW MEXICO MORE COMPETITIVE. WE HAVE UNDERSTOOD NEW MEXICO
HAS NOT BEEN COMPETITIVE FOR MANY YEARS AND WE'RE WORKING HARD AT REDUCING OUR TAXES FOR
THE FAMILIES AND SMALL
BUSINESSES IN NEW MEXICO. WE HAVE EMBRACED OUR ENERGY RICH
STATE IN A VERY RESPONSIBLE WAY.
BECAUSE OF THAT, WE ARE SEEING
WE ARE RETURNING -- WE ARE TURNING THE CORNER, YET THERE IS A LOT OF WORK TO BE DONE. WE ARE DOING IT IN NEW MEXICO
NOW WHERE WE ARE REFORMING THINGS AND CHANGING THINGS AND
BRINGING PEOPLE INTO THE PROCESS
