<strong>Linda Lingle</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> A LOW HOT TO THE GREAT STATE OF HAWAII AND A SPECIAL ALOHA TO
THE DELEGATION FROM ILLINOIS, MY
HOME STATE FOR THE PAST YEAR. THE LAST EIGHT YEARS HAVE<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> BEEN A
WAKE-UP CALL TO AMERICAN JEWS.
MORE FEEL AS I DO, THAT THERE IS
SOMETHING WRONG WITH AMERICA'S LEADERSHIP TODAY. A NEW DIRECTION IS NEEDED,
PARTICULARLY ON THE MANY ISSUES
IMPORTANT TO JEWISH AMERICANS. AT HOME, WE ARE APPROACHING $20
TRILLION IN DEBT. MORE ADULTS THAN EVER ARE WORKING AND PUBLIC EDUCATION IN
OUR CITIES IS IN TATTERS. THE SOCIAL COMPACT AT THE
FOUNDATION OF OUR DEMOCRACY IS BEING SHREDDED. THESE ARE THE DIRECT RESULT OF
FAILED POLICIES. TODAY, OUR COUNTRY IS MORE
DIVIDED THAN EVER AND OUR NATIONAL SECURITY IS THREATENED. DEMOCRATS REFUSE TO EVEN CALL SOURCES OF SO MUCH OF THIS VIOLENCE BY ITS NAME OR TO ACKNOWLEDGE ITS CAUSE. WHEN IT COMES TO ENGAGING WITH A WORLD, AMERICA SHOULD DEFEND OUR
NATIONAL INTERESTS AND OUR ALLIES FIRST. CLINTON AND OBAMA HAVE TREATED OUR ALLIES AS STRANGERS,
INSULTED THEIR LEADERS, AND
IGNORED THEIR ADVICE AND INTERESTS. LET'S COMPARE THE POSITIONS OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY ON ISRAEL.
ON ONE ISSUE AFTER ANOTHER, FROM BOYCOTT, DAVIS MEANT SANCTIONS
TO THE IRAN NUCLEAR AGREEMENT,
TO THE VERY LEGITIMACY OF
ISRAEL, THEY ARE DIVIDED. WITH THOSE WHO DON'T CARE FOR ISRAEL GETTING STRONGER IN THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY. YOU WILL FIND NO SUCH DIVISION
IN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY'S
LEADERSHIP.
[APPLAUSE] WITH UNANIMITY, WE PASSED A PLATFORM SUPPORTING A UNITED JERUSALEM, CONDEMNING EBF AND
CALLING IT WHAT IT IS,
ANTI-SEMITISM.
[APPLAUSE] WE REINFORCED OUR CONSISTENT OPPOSITION TO THE IRAN NUCLEAR AGREEMENT. ALONG WITH MANY OTHER POLICIES
OF THIS ADMINISTRATION, THAT
AGREEMENT IS PROPPING UP THE WORLD LEADING STATE SPONSOR OF TERRORISM, INCLUDING PROXIES LIKE HEZBOLLAH WITH 150,000 ROCKETS POINTED AT ISRAEL, POISED TO STRIKE. IF THIS WORRIES YOU, YOU ARE NOT
ALONE. YOU ARE PART OF A MOVEMENT.
THIS INCLUDES AMERICAN JEWS WHO IN FIVE OF THE LAST SIX
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS HAVE SUPPORTED THE REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE IN
INCREASING NUMBERS.
[APPLAUSE] THE SUPPORT FOR REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES BY
JEWISH AMERICANS HAVE TRIPLED OVER THE PAST 35 YEARS -- PAST 25 YEARS. REPUBLICAN LEADERSHIP IN THE
HOUSE, THE SENATE, AND ACROSS THE COUNTRY HAS EARNED IT YOUR TRUST ON THE ISSUES OF
IMPORTANCE TO ALL OF US. JOIN US AS WE WORK TOGETHER WITH
OUR PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE,
DONALD TRUMP AND VICE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE MIKE PENCE TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT
AGAIN.
