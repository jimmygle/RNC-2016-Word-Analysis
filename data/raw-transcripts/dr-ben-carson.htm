<strong>Ben Carson Sr., M.D.</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> DR. CARSON: THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU, EVERYONE. THANK YOU.
[APPLAUSE] DR. CARSON: THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH.
THANK YOU.
[APPLAUSE] DR. CARSON:<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT. DON'T EAT UP MY TIME.
THANK YOU.
[LAUGHTER] DR. CARSON: I WANT TO THANK YOU
ALL FOR THAT VERY WARM WELCOME. I HAVE TO START OUT BY SAYING ONE VERY IMPORTANT THING. I AM NOT POLITICALLY CORRECT.
[CHEERING] DR. CARSON: I HATE POLITICAL CORRECTNESS BECAUSE IT IS
ANTITHETICAL TO THE FOUNDING
PRINCIPLES OF THIS COUNTRY AND THE SECULAR PROGRESSIVES USE IT TO MAKE PEOPLE SIT DOWN AND SHUT UP WHILE THEY CHANGE EVERYTHING.
IT IS TIME FOR US TO STAND UP
AND SHOUT OUT ABOUT WHAT WE
BELIEVE IN.
[CHEERING]
[APPLAUSE] DR. CARSON: YOU KNOW, I DEVOTED MY CAREER TO STUDYING AND OPERATING ON THE HUMAN BRAIN.
THIS REMARKABLE ORGAN TO FIND OUR HUMANITY.
IT GIVES US THE ABILITY TO NOT
ONLY FEEL AND OBSERVE, BUT TO
REASON.
WHEN WE ELECT A PRESIDENT, WE
NEED TO USE THAT POWER OF REASONING TO LOOK AT THEIR
HISTORY, THEIR CHARACTER, WHAT
KIND OF PEOPLE THEY REALLY ARE.
IT MAKES ALL THE DIFFERENCE IN
THE WORLD FOR US.
IT IS GOING TO BE SO CRITICAL RIGHT NOW. WE MUST RESIST THE TEMPTATION TO
TAKE THE EASY WAY OUT. ENTER PASSIVELY ACCEPT WHAT IS
FED TO US BY THE POLITICALLY
ELITE AND THE MEDIA. THEY DO NOT KNOW WHAT THEY ARE
TALKING ABOUT, BUT THEY HAVE AN
AGENDA.
[APPLAUSE] DR. CARSON: WE MUST ALSO BE WARY
OF THE NARRATIVE THAT IS BEING ADVANCED BY SOME IN OUR OWN PARTY, THE NOTION THAT A HILLARY CLINTON ADMINISTRATION WOULD NOT
BE THAT BAD.
THE EFFECTS WOULD ONLY BE
TEMPORARY.
[THE -- [BOOING] DR. CARSON: THEY ARE NOT USING
THEIR GOD-GIVEN BRAIN TO THINK
ABOUT WHAT THEY ARE SAYING.
IT WILL NOT BE FOUR YEARS OR EIGHT YEARS. SHE WILL BE APPOINTING PEOPLE
WHO WILL HAVE AN EFFECT ON US FOR GENERATIONS, AND AMERICA MAY
NEVER RECOVER FROM THAT.
THAT IS WHAT WE HAVE TO BE
THINKING ABOUT.
[APPLAUSE] DR. CARSON: YOU KNOW, INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH, WE HAVE TO
START THINKING ABOUT WHAT WOULD HILLARY CLINTON DO IF SHE WAS,
IN FACT, THE PRESIDENT.
SHE WOULD APPOINT SUPREME COURT JUSTICES, SHE WOULD APPOINT FEDERAL JUDGES, AND THAT WOULD HAVE A DELETERIOUS EFFECT FOR
GENERATIONS TO COME.
SHE WOULD CONTINUE WITH A SYSTEM THAT DENIGRATES THE EDUCATION OF
OUR YOUNG PEOPLE, PUTS THEM IN A PLACE WHERE THEY ARE NEVER GOING
TO BE ABLE TO GET A JOB, WHERE
THEY ARE ALWAYS GOING TO BE DEPENDENT AND WHERE THEY CAN THEREFORE BE CALLED DEBATED FOR
THEIR VOTES.
THIS IS NOT WHAT AMERICA IS ALL
ABOUT. THIS KIND OF DECEPTION. THIS IS WHAT WE, THE PEOPLE,
HAVE THE NECESSARY OBLIGATION TO
FIGHT.
[APPLAUSE]
[CHEERING] DR. CARSON: NOW, ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I HAVE LEARNED ABOUT HILLARY CLINTON IS THAT ONE OF
HER HEROES, HER MENTORS, WAS SALMA LINSKY.
[BOOING] DR. CARSON: HER SENIOR THESIS
WAS ABOUT SOME LINSKY. THIS WAS SOMEONE SHE GREATLY
ADMIRED AND THAT AFFECTED ALL OF HER PHILOSOPHY SUBSEQUENTLY. INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH, LET ME
TELL YOU SOMETHING ABOUT HIM. HE WROTE A BOOK CALLED "RULES FOR RADICALS ON THE DEDICATION PAGE, IT'D KNOWLEDGE IS LUCIFER, THE ORIGINAL RADICAL WHO GAINED HIS OWN KINGDOM.
THINK ABOUT THAT. THIS IS A NATION WHERE OUR
FOUNDING DOCUMENT, THE THAT
VERSION OF INDEPENDENCE, TOPS
ABOUT CERTAIN INALIENABLE RIGHTS THAT COME FROM OUR CREATOR. THIS IS A NATION WHERE OUR
PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE SAYS WE ARE
ONE NATION UNDER GOD. THIS IS A NATION -- 
[APPLAUSE] DR. CARSON: THIS IS A NATION
WERE EVERY COIN IN OUR POCKET
AND EVERY BILL AND OUR WALLETS
AS "IN GOD WE TRUST." SO, ARE WE WILLING TO ELECT
SOMEONE AS PRESIDENT WHO HAS, AS THEIR ROLE MODEL, SOMEBODY WHO ACKNOWLEDGES LUCIFER? THINK ABOUT THAT.
[BOOING] DR. CARSON: THE SECULAR PROGRESSIVE AGENDA IS
ANTITHETICAL TO THE PRINCIPLES
OF THE FOUNDING OF THIS NATION. IF WE CONTINUE TO ALLOW THEM TO TAKE GOD OUT OF OUR LIVES, GOD
WILL REMOVE HIMSELF FROM US. WE WILL NOT BE BLESSED AND OUR NATION WILL GO DOWN THE TUBES. WE WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT. WE DO NOT WANT THAT TO HAPPEN. NOW, DONALD TRUMP, HE UNDERSTANDS THIS VERY WELL. HE UNDERSTANDS THAT THE
BLESSINGS OF THIS NATION COME
WITH THE RESPONSIBILITY TO ENSURE THAT THEY ARE AVAILABLE
TO ALL, NOT JUST THE PRIVILEGED
FEW. THIS IS EXEMPLIFIED BY HIS WILLINGNESS TO TAKE ON THE ESTABLISHMENT AGAINST ALL ODDS. IT IS EVIDENT IN HIS PASSION FOR
THE AMERICAN WORKER, IT IS FOUND IN HIS DESIRE TO PUT HIS
CONSIDERABLE SKILLS TO WORK ON
BEHALF OF AMERICAN INTERESTS,
NOT HIS SELF INTERESTS.
I AM PROUD TO SUPPORT DONALD TRUMP. HE IS AN EXTERMINATOR BUSINESSMAN, THE RIGHT LEADER
FOR A TIME SUCH AS THIS.
[CHEERING]
[APPLAUSE] DR. CARSON: BUT YOU KNOW WHAT? IT IS NOT ABOUT DONALD TRUMP. IT IS NOT ABOUT ME.
IT IS ABOUT WE THE PEOPLE. THOMAS JEFFERSON SAID THAT WE
WOULD REACH THIS POINT BECAUSE
WE THE PEOPLE WOULD NOT BE PAYING ATTENTION, AND IT WOULD
ALLOW THE GOVERNMENT TO GROW TO EXPAND, AND TO ASSESS THE SIZE,
AND TO TRY TO RULE US.
-- TO METASTICIZE, AND TO TRY
TO RULE US.
WE WOULD RISE UP AND TAKE CONTROL OF OUR NATION AND I SAY, NOW IS THE TIME FOR US TO RISE
AND TAKE AMERICA BACK.
