<strong>Darryl Glenn</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> DARRELL: GIVE GOD THE GLORY.
[APPLAUSE] GOOD EVENING. I AM AN UNAPOLOGETIC CHRISTIAN CONSTITUTIONALIST CONSERVATIVE.
[APPLAUSE] I AM YOUR REPUBLICAN NOMINEE<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> FOR THE SENATE IN THE NUMBER ONE
BATTLEGROUND STATE IN THIS COUNTRY, AND THAT IS COLORADO. IT IS MY PRIVILEGE TO STAND HERE AND SUPPORT OUR NEXT PRESIDENT, DONALD TRUMP. I AM OFTEN ASKED WHY ARE YOUR REPUBLICAN? IT'S BECAUSE THE DEMOCRAT PARTY
IS THE PARTY OF HANDOUTS. AFTER MORE THAN SEVEN YEARS THE ONLY THING WE HAVE LEFT IN OUR
POCKETS IS CHANGE. THIS PRESIDENT RAN TO BE
COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF. HIS RHETORIC HIS RHETORIC HAS
MADE HIM THE DIVIDER IN CHIEF. WE ARE MORE RACIALLY DIVIDED
TODAY THAN BEFORE HE RAN. BUT THERE IS MORE. DID YOU SEE THE NEW BLACK
PANTHERS OUTSIDE? WHERE ARE JESSE JACKSON AND AL
SHARPTON? THEY DON'T SPEAK FOR BLACK
AMERICA AND THEY DON'T SPEAK FOR
ME. MR. PRESIDENT, I HAVE A MESSAGE. THIS IS NOT ABOUT BLACK AMERICA, WHITE AMERICA, BROWN AMERICA.
THIS IS ABOUT THE UNITED STATES
OF AMERICA. SOMEBODY WITH A NICE TAN IT NEEDS TO SAY THIS. ALL LIVES MATTER.
[APPLAUSE] HERE ARE SOME MORE FACTS MR. PRESIDENT. NEIGHBORHOODS HAVE BECOME MORE
VIOLENT UNDER YOUR WATCH. YOUR RHETORIC HAS A DIRECT IMPACT ON THE RELATIONSHIP
BETWEEN THE COMMUNITY AND THE
POLICE. WE CAN BRING THIS COUNTRY
TOGETHER. BUT WE MUST REALIZE THAT OUR HEROES AND BLUE ARE PART OF THE SOLUTION AND NOT THE PROBLEM. STAND UP AND SUPPORT THOSE MEN
AND WOMEN IN DALLAS. STAND UP AND SUPPORT THOSE PEOPLE IN LOUISIANA. BLUE LIVES MATTER.
[APPLAUSE] NOBODY WANTS BAN CAPS OFF THE
STREET MORE THAN GOOD COPS. IF WE REALLY WANT TO HEAR ALL OUR COMMUNITY, MORE MEN NEED TO
START STEPPING UP AND TAKING CARE OF THEIR CHILDREN.
[APPLAUSE] SAFE NEIGHBORHOODS HAPPEN WHEN
FATHERS AND MOTHERS ARE HOME. WE MUST RECOGNIZE THAT EVIL
EXISTS IN THIS WORLD. THE THREAT FROM RADICAL ISLAMIC
TERRORISM IS REAL. OUR TROOPS DON'T CARE WHAT PARTY
YOU REPRESENT. THEY CARE ABOUT HAVING THE TOOLS AND THE TRAINING AND EQUIPMENT TO DO THEIR JOBS. IF YOU PUT THEM IN HARMS WAY,
LET THEM WIN.
[APPLAUSE] WHEN THEY COME HOME, HONOR THEM
AND CARE FOR THEIR INJURIES. MY FRIENDS, WE MUST WIN THIS
ELECTION.
HILLARY CLINTON IS UNFIT TO BE
PRESIDENT.
[APPLAUSE] WE ALL KNOW SHE LOVES HER
PANTSUITS. YOU KNOW WHAT COMING. WE SHOULD SEND HER AN E-MAIL AND
TELL HER SHE DESERVES A BRIGHT
ORANGE JUMPSUIT.
[APPLAUSE] HERE'S THE BOTTOM LINE. AMERICAN EXCEPTIONALISM IS ALIVE AND WELL. EVIL EXISTS. AS GOD IS MY WITNESS, THE BATTLE CAN BE ONE.
BELIEVE WE CAN WIN. BELIEVE WE CAN CHANGE THINGS. BELIEVE IT TOGETHER WE CAN MAKE
AMERICA GREAT AGAIN.
[APPLAUSE] MY NAME IS DARRYL GLENN AND I
CAN'T DO THIS WITHOUT YOUR HELP.
GOD BLESS EACH AND EVERYONE OF
YOU. GOD BLESS THE GREAT STATE OF
COLORADO. GOD BLESS THE UNITED STATES OF
AMERICA.
THANK YOU.
[APPLAUSE]
