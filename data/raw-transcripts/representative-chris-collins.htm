<strong>Jeff Sessions</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> SEN. SESSIONS: MR. SPEAKER,
AMERICANS LOVE OUR COUNTRY LIKE
NO OTHER PEOPLE ON EARTH.
[APPLAUSE] BUT WE HAVE GONE OFF COURSE AND
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE KNOW<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> IT. OUR POLITICAL SYSTEM IS NOT
WORKING. WE OPERATE LIKE A TRENCH WARFARE BATTLES OF WORLD WAR I WHERE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS DIED BUT
NO GROUND IS GAINED. GOOD AMERICANS WILL STAND FOR
THIS NO LONGER. THEY WANT THE POLITICAL GAME, THE POSTURING AND THE SHOWBOATING TO END. THEY WANT THEIR COUNTRY ON THE RIGHT TRACK AGAIN. MEDIAN INCOME HAS DECLINED. TERRORIST ATTACKS ARE
INCREASING. RESPECT FOR AMERICA HAS FALLEN. CRIME IS RISING. AND THE PRESIDENT, HE BLAMES THE
POLICE. THE PRESIDENT DOES NOT LEAD. CONGRESS IS DEADLOCKED. THE POLITICAL, CORPORATE AND MEDIA ESTABLISHMENT, THEY SAY
CALM DOWN. DON'T OVERREACT, DON'T BE POLITICALLY INCORRECT. UNSTATED IS A THREAT. IF YOU PERSIST IN YOUR COMPLAINTS, WE WILL ATTACK YOU. BUT, THIS TIME IT'S DIFFERENT.
[APPLAUSE] ONE MAN, DONALD TRUMP, WAS NOT
INTIMIDATED.
[APPLAUSE] HE WOULD NOT BE SILENCED. HE SPOKE THE TRUTH. HE GAVE VOICE TO THE PEOPLE'S CONCERNS. HE SAID THAT THE TRADE DEALS HAVE HURT AMERICA AND PEOPLE. THAT OUR BORDER MUST BE
SECURED.
THAT OUR NATION, THAT OUR NATION MUST BE STRONG. THAT WE MUST DEFEAT THE
TERRORISTS WHO THREATEN US. THAT WE MUST RESTORE LAW AND
ORDER. AND, SUPPORT OUR COURAGEOUS LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS.
[APPLAUSE] THE AMERICANS -- THE AMERICAN
VOTERS HEARD THIS
MESSAGE AND THEY WERE BOARDED REWARDED HIS LEADERSHIP WITH A HUGE VICTORY IN OUR PRIMARY. HE DISPATCHED ONE TALENTED, FINE
CANDIDATE AFTER ANOTHER. MOMENTUM CONTINUED TO GROW.
A MOVEMENT STARTED. DEMOCRATS AND INDEPENDENTS
RESPONDED. HE RECEIVED FAR MORE PRIMARY
VOTES THAN ANY REPUBLICAN
CANDIDATE IN HISTORY.
[APPLAUSE] LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT THE DONALD
TRUMP I HAVE COME TO KNOW. HE HAS A WONDERFUL FAMILY WHICH
HE LOVES INTENSELY. HIS PERSONAL RELATIONS, HE'S UNFAILING COURTEOUS AND GENEROUS
AND POSITIVE BY NATURE. HE HAS TREMENDOUS ENERGY AND STRENGTH.
HE IS A WARRIOR AND A WINNER. HE LOVES HIS COUNTRY AND HE IS DETERMINED TO SEE IT BE A WINNER AGAIN. I HAVE BEEN PROUD OF THIS PARTY AND ITS PRINCIPLE
SINCE I WAS A TEENAGER. IT IS NOT GIVEN TO US TO SEE
THE FUTURE BUT I CAME TO BELIEVE
SOME MONTHS AGO THAT DONALD
TRUMP IS THE SINGULAR LEADER
THAT CAN GET THIS COUNTRY BACK
ON TRACK.
[APPLAUSE] HE HAS THE STRENGTH, THE COURAGE AND WILL TO GET IT DONE. HE AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE SHARE A COMMON GOAL, AND TOGETHER, WE WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN.
[APPLAUSE] MR. SPEAKER, MR. SPEAKER, IT
IS MY DISTINCT HONOR AND GREAT PLEASURE TO NOMINATE DONALD J. TRUMP FOR THE OFFICE OF PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
OF AMERICA. THANK YOU. AND GOD BLESS.
[APPLAUSE]

<strong>Chris Collins</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> MR. COLLINS: THANK YOU, MY FELLOW NEW YORKERS. SPEAKER RYAN, THANK YOU FOR YOUR
INTRODUCTION. THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP
AND WILLINGNESS TO PUT FORTH<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> POLICIES THAT WILL TRULY MAKE
AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. AS THE FIRST MEMBER OF CONGRESS
TO ENDORSE DONALD TRUMP, I ALSO
WANT TO THANK SENATOR SESSIONS
WHO HAS STOOD WITH ME FROM THE
BEGINNING IN SUPPORT OF DONALD
TRUMP.
[APPLAUSE] I PROUDLY REPRESENT WESTERN NEW YORK. WHICH HAS BEEN DEVASTATED BY
UNFAIR TRADE DEALS, ALLOWING
COUNTRIES LIKE CHINA AND MEXICO
TO STEAL OUR JOBS, ROBBING OUR CHILDREN OF THE OPPORTUNITY TO
LIVE THE AMERICAN DREAM. THE STAKES IN THIS ELECTION CANNOT BE OVERSTATED. WE WILL EITHER MAKE
AMERICA GREAT AGAIN OR TRAVEL
DOWN THE PATH OF A THIRD OBAMA
TERM.
[BOOING] UNDER BARACK OBAMA, WE HAVE BEEN LOSING. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TRAMPLES ON OUR RIGHTS. OUR ALLIES CAN NO LONGER DEPEND ON US. OUR ENEMIES DEFY US. OUR COUNTRY HAS NO BORDERS AND
CHINA AND MEXICO CONTINUE TO
STEAL OUR JOBS. ENOUGH IS ENOUGH.
[APPLAUSE] IT IS TIME TO TAKE BACK OUR COUNTRY, THE GREAT UNITED STATES
OF AMERICA.
[APPLAUSE] PRESIDENT TRUMP IS GOING TO BUILD A WALL AND SECURE OUR
BORDERS.
[APPLAUSE] PRESIDENT TRUMP IS GOING TO DEFEAT TERRORISM AND MAKE OUR
COUNTRY SAFE AGAIN.
[APPLAUSE] PRESIDENT TRUMP IS GOING TO
BRING BACK OUR STOLEN JOBS. WE IN WESTERN NEW YORK KNOW DONALD TRUMP IS NOT MERELY A CANDIDATE, DONALD TRUMP IS A
MOVEMENT.
[APPLAUSE] THAT IS WHY, MR. SPEAKER, I HAVE
THE HONOR OF SECONDING THE
NOMINATION OF DONALD J. TRUMP AS THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED
STATES OF AMERICA.
[APPLAUSE] YOU GOT IT. THANK YOU ALL. THANK YOU ALL. THANK YOU.</span><span class='hidden-full-transcript-ellipses'>...</span></p><a href='#' class='hidden-full-transcript-link'><i class='icon-chevron-down'></i> <span class='link-show-full-text'>Show Full Text</span><i class='icon-chevron-up'></i> <span class='link-show-less-text'>Show Less Text</span></a>
