THE CHAIR WOULD LIKE TO PUT
DELEGATES ON NOTICE THAT THE

NECESSARY NUMBER OF STATES
REQUIRED BY OUR RULES. THIS WRITTEN CONFIRMATION IS
CONSISTENT WITH OUR MODERN PRACTICE AND PRECEDENT DURING PREVIOUS CONVENTIONS WITH
SIMILAR ANNOUNCEMENTS, AS WELL

THAT GUESTS AND ALTERNATES IN
THE GALLERY REMAIN SILENT DURING VOICE VOTES TO ENSURE THE CHAIR

ARE NOT SPEAKING DURING VOTES. THE CHAIR NOW RECOGNIZES SUZY HUDSON FOR THE PURPOSE OF

<strong>Steve King</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> WELCOME.
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, DELEGATES, CITIZENS, AND PATRIOTS. WELCOME TO THE 41ST REPUBLICAN
NATIONAL CONVENTION. WHEN LAST THE GRAND OLD PARTY,
OR<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> AS A NEW TWIT SAY, THE PARTY OF GROWTH AND PROGRESS GATHERED IN THE GREAT CITY IT WAS 80
YEARS AGO. IMAGINE IN 1936 OUR NATION WAS
STILL ON ITS BACK, REELING FROM
THE AFTERSHOCKS OF THE 1929
STOCK MARKET CRASH. THE DUST BOWL WAS STILL IN
GOLFING THE MIDWEST. AND THE AVERAGE ANNUAL FAMILY INCOME WAS JUST OVER $1500 PER
YEAR. FEELS A LOT LIKE THE LAST
SEVENTH AND FIVE YEARS OF BARACK
OBAMA TO ME.
-- LAST 7.5 YEARS OF BARACK OBAMA TO ME. JAMES CLEVELAND WINS, JESSE OWENS, A BLACK SON OF A SHARECROPPER IN ALABAMA WON FOUR GOLD MEDALS IN THE OLYMPIC
GAMES, THUMBING AMERICA'S NOSE
IN HITLER'S FACE. THE DUTIES INCUMBENT UPON US AS
DELEGATES AND CITIZENS AND PATRIOTS HAVE NEVER CHANGED IN
THE 80 YEARS. OUR JOBS HERE ARE THE SAME AS
THEY WERE 80 YEARS AGO, THE
RIGHT, THE LIBERTY, AND THE
PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS, ONLY GIVE IT TO US BY GOD. FOR THE NEXT FEW WE GATHER HERE
IN THE HOME OF THE WORLD CHAMPION CLEVELAND CAVALIERS. I WANT TO THANK DAN GILBERT, THE
FOUNDER OF CAN LOANS AND OWNER
OF THE 2016 NBA CHAMPION FOR BEING OUR PERSONAL HOST AND TRUE
FRIEND IN CLEVELAND. I ALSO WANT TO THANK MAYOR FRANK JAN -- FRANK JACKSON. AND THE ENTIRE GOP HOST
COMMITTEE LED BY CHRIS CONNOR, SANDY CUTLER, SETH, AND THEIR CEO DAVID GILBERTS, WHO HAVE
SPENT EVERY MORNING AND NIGHT
SINCE 2014 MAKING THIS HOUR REALITY, OUR TIME, AND OUR PLACE
OF CHOOSING IN CLEVELAND. THANK YOU. IN 1980, NOT FAR FROM HERE, IN
THE CITY OF DETROIT, ANOTHER GREAT RUST BELT IN METROPOLIS THAT NEVER GAVE UP, THE WORK OF DELEGATES RESULTED IN THE
NOMINATION OF A MAN WHO WAS GIVEN NO REAL CHANCE TO BECOME THE NEXT LEADER OF THE FREE WORLD. HIS NAME WAS RONALD REAGAN. AND HE LOOKED AT HIS JOB AS THE
40TH PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES MUCH THE SAME AS WE
DELEGATES HERE DO. IF YOU WANT TO MAKE AMERICA
GREAT YOU CAN ACCOMPLISH
ANYTHING IF YOU DON'T CARE WHO
GETS THE CREDIT. ONCE AGAIN AMERICA IS AT A
CROSSROADS. WE HAVE IN OUR HANDS THE STEERING WHEEL OF THE POLITICAL
PARTY IN THIS COUNTRY. BUMPY ROADS, BUT WE ARE NOT
GOING TO TURN LEFT. AS DELEGATES WE UNDERTAKE THE DUTIES AND BLESSINGS FOR MAKING
FREEDOM WORK FOR THE NEXT
GENERATION. A NATIONAL CONVENTION IS MORE
THAN JUST A NATIONAL BROADCAST, A SERIES OF SOUND BITES
SNIPPETS, OR TWEETS. IT IS THE CAREFUL WORK OF A

I HOPE YOU TAKE SOME TIME TO GET
TO KNOW US, BECAUSE WE ARE
REALLY HAPPY YOU ARE HERE. EVERYTHING WE HAVE DONE THAT HAS
BEEN IN CLEVELAND THAT'S BEEN SUCCESSFUL, INCLUDING THE
OPPORTUNITY TO HOST THIS CONVENTION, IS BECAUSE WE HAVE DONE IT AS A COMMUNITY. OUR INNOVATIVE REFORM PLAN WAS THE RESULT OF COLLABORATION BETWEEN REPUBLICANS, DEMOCRATS, BUSINESS, LABOR, PUBLIC SCHOOLS, CHARTER SCHOOLS, PHILANTHROPIC COMMUNITIES, AND OF COURSE THE
CITIZENS OF THE COMMUNITY'S OF CLEVELAND. OUR COOPERATIVE EFFORTS RESULTED IN A COMPREHENSIVE WITH -- COMPREHENSIVE AGREEMENT WITH POLICE AND A VISION THAT GOES
BEYOND THAT AGREEMENT TO PROVIDE OUR CITIZENS WITH WELL-EQUIPPED
AND WELL-TRAINED POLICE
DIVISIONS THAT HAS COMMUNITY POLICING AS PART OF ITS REAL POLICING FOR -- REAL POLICING REFORM. WE ARE A CITY OF GREAT ETHNIC
AND CULTURAL DIVERSITY THAT
WORKS TOGETHER TO WELCOME EVERYONE. THE REBIRTH OF CLEVELAND IS EVIDENT AS WE LOOK AT CLEVELAND
BECOMING A DESTINATION FOR BUSINESSES, A NEW RESIDENT FOR
FOOD AND ENTERTAINMENT AND
LIFESTYLE. CLEVELAND IS A CITY OF MOVIE
MAKE IN. WE PUT ON THIS YEAR'S 2016
REPUBLICAN NATIONAL CONVENTION. YOU ARE IN A CITY WITH THE MOST
ROBUST CULTURE OF ARTS BETWEEN
NEW YORK AND CHICAGO. SEE A SHOW ON ONE OF OUR STAGES,

WORLD-CLASS RESTAURANTS AND
CHEFS. ENJOY OUR DOWNTOWN HOSPITALITY,
VENTURE INTO OUR NEIGHBORHOODS
AS WELL AS OUR NEWLY RENOVATED
SQUARE. ALL THESE THINGS ARE A REFLECTION OF THE HARD-WORKING AND DIVERSE PEOPLE OF THIS CITY. AS I TRAVEL THROUGHOUT THE CITY AND I TALKED TO THE PEOPLE WILL,
I AM REMINDED THAT WE STILL HAVE A WAYS TO GO TO BECOME A GREAT CITY. A TRULY GREAT CITY WILL BE MEASURED BY THE WELL-BEING OF ITS PEOPLE. I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT WELFARE AND CHARITY. I'M TALKING ABOUT HOW DO WE HAVE EVERYONE PARTICIPATE IN THAT QUALITY OF LIFE?
. IT IS STRIVING FOR GREATNESS. THIS IS THE CHALLENGE WE EMBRACE
AND THE STRUGGLE AND THE FIGHT
WE TAKE ON. HE WILL BE SUCCESSFUL BECAUSE WE WILL DO IT AS ONE COMMUNITY. SOME OF YOU MAY HAVE HEARD ABOUT LAST MONTH'S NBA GAMES WHEN THE
CAVALIERS DID NOT INVITE A
NATIONALLY KNOWN RECORDING ARTIST TO SING THE NATIONAL
ANTHEM. IN THIS BUILDING WE ALL SING IT
TOGETHER. IT'S IN THAT SPIRIT WE GREET YOU
TO CLEVELAND AND WELCOME YOU TO

WHERE<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> THE WATER WAS POISONED
FROM LEAD. I VISITED A PASTOR THERE AND INSIDE HIS CHURCH WERE STACKS
AND STACKS OF WHAT WHITE BECAUSE
HIS CONGREGATION COULD NOT DRINK
FROM THE TAP OR USE THEIR
SHOWER. PREGNANT MOTHERS AND MOTHERS WITH NEWBORNS STILL SHOULD NOT
RAISE OR DRINK THE WATER.
AND THAT IS NOT RIGHT, BUT I
WILL MAKE IT RIGHT BECAUSE IN
MICHIGAN, THE SYSTEM IS NOT RIGGED.
IN MICHIGAN, WE HAVE ONE SYSTEM OF JUSTICE THAT MEANS THE RULES
APPLY TO ALL, NO MATTER WHO YOU
ARE. THE FAMILIES OF WENT HAVE NOT
RECEIVED JUSTICE, BUT I CAN PROMISE THAT JUSTICE IS COMING TO FLINT.
[APPLAUSE] I'M ALSO CHAIRMAN OF THE
REPUBLICAN ATTORNEYS GENERAL ASSOCIATION. 27 WOMEN AND MEN DEDICATED TO DEFENDING THE CONSTITUTION AND UPHOLDING THE RULE OF LAW. WE WORK SIDE BY THOSE ON THE
FRONT LINES OF THE LAW, WHICH LEADS ME TO ANOTHER STORY ABOUT
MICHIGAN. JUST DAYS AGO, TO COURT OFFICERS
WERE KILLED IN THE LINE OF DUTY.
THESE BRAVE MEN DIED JUST FIVE
DAYS AFTER POLICE OFFICERS WERE
SLAIN IN DALLAS. RONALD REAGAN CALLED AMERICA A
SPECIAL LAND, SITUATED BETWEEN TWO GREAT OCEANS, INHABITED BY PEOPLE WHAT THEY LOVE OF
FREEDOM, FAITH AND PEACE. SCRIPTURE SAID BLESSED ARE THE
PEACEMAKERS, BUT THE TRUTH IS, WE ARE ALL CALLED TO BE
PEACEMAKERS AND PEACE STARTS WITH US, WHEREVER WE MAY LIVE, FROM DETROIT TO DALLAS, FROM
MARIAN TO BATON ROUGE AND WE CAN
START BY HONORING THE
PEACEMAKERS AMONG US. LET'S THAN THEN RECOGNIZE THE
BRAVE MEN AND WOMEN WHO SERVE
AND PROTECT. LET'S STAND WITH THE POLICE AND SHERIFFS DEPUTIES WHO UNDERSTAND
COURAGE AND HONOR. LET'S STAND WITH THE YOUNG MOTHER IN A CITY WHOSE CHILDREN
HUNGER FOR THIRST AND LET'S STAND WITH THE PARENTS WHOSE ONE DESIRE IS THAT THEIR CHILDREN
CAN GO TO SCHOOL SAFELY AND
LEARN TO READ AND FIND THE PATH TO THE SHINING CITY ON THE HILL. WHEN WE STAND WITH THEM, WHEN WE STAND WITH EACH OTHER, WE STAND

PROCESS THAT MAKES AMERICA
GREAT. BY CELEBRATING THE NOMINATION OF NEW YORKER DONALD TRUMP AND INDIANA'S MIKE PENCE. WITH MUCH TO CELEBRATE AT THE TOP OF THE TICKET, ONE OF THE
MOST AMAZING STORIES IS AT THE
STATE LEVEL, WHERE REAL ACTION
AND REAL RESULTS ARE HAPPENING. GOVERNMENT CLOSEST TO THE PEOPLE
HAS ALWAYS GOVERNED BEST,
ESPECIALLY IN TODAY'S BOTTOM-UP WORLD. REPUBLICAN STATE LEADERS
RECOGNIZE THIS AND IMPLEMENT
POLICIES THAT MAKE A REAL
DIFFERENCE TO PEOPLE'S POCKETBOOK, ROADS AND BRIDGES WHILE CREATING OPPORTUNITIES FOR
THE FUTURE. IT IS A STARK CONTRAST TO THE INSIDER, D.C. MINDSET THAT HAS ACCOMPLISHED VIRTUALLY NOTHING OTHER THAN REPEATEDLY AND UNDER CONSTANT OVERREACHING INTO THE
STATE. VOTERS HAVE EXPERIENCED THIS
FIRST HAND AND SAID ENOUGH IS
ENOUGH. THEY KICKED STATE DEMOCRATS OUT
IN DROVES AND GIVING REPUBLICANS AND ALMOST UNHEARD OF 900 NEW LEGISLATIVE SEATS IN THE OBAMA
ERA WHILE JUST LAST WEEK, GALLUP
POLLING SHOWED VOTERS PREFER THEIR STATE GOVERNMENT TO THE EC
GOVERNMENT BY NEARLY TWO TO ONE. REPUBLICANS HOLD AN ALL-TIME RECORD OF 69 OF 99 LEGISLATURES AND HAVE MODERN RECORDS AND MANY
OTHER STATEWIDE OFFICES. SINCE 2002, THE LEADERSHIP COMMITTEE HAS SUPPORTED STATE LEVEL REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES FOR
LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR, ATTORNEY
GENERAL, SECRETARY OF STATE, LEGISLATORS, THE JUDICIARY, AND
MANY MORE. WITH THE WORLD'S ONLY TOP-LEVEL
DOMAIN RUN BY A POLITICAL PARTY,
WE HOUSE A CONCENTRATED EFFORT
ON BALLOT INITIATIVES WHILE OUR
RED MAP REDISTRICT AND PROGRAM
FIGHTS FOR DISTRICT LINES. PERHAPS MOST IMPORTANTLY, WE HAVE SPENT MILLIONS IDENTIFYING AND SUPPORTING THOUSANDS OF NEW
CANDIDATES OF DIVERSE ETHNICITY,
CREATING NEW LEADERS NOW AND STRENGTHENING OUR PARTIES BENT
FOR THE FUTURE. THE IMPORTANCE OF THE TEAM CANNOT BE OVERSTATED. A REPRESENT NEARLY HALF OF OUR
NATION'S PRESIDENTS AND A
MAJORITY OF THE CURRENT CONGRESS.
WE HAVE SEEN HISTORIC SUCCESS AT
THE STATE LEVEL RESUMING AND WITH SO MANY NEW CANDIDATES ON THE BALLOT AND YOUR HELP, THERE
IS MUCH MORE TO COME. THANK YOU, AND WE WILL SEE YOU AGAIN ON ELECTION DAY.

<strong>Linda Lingle</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> A LOW HOT TO THE GREAT STATE OF HAWAII AND A SPECIAL ALOHA TO
THE DELEGATION FROM ILLINOIS, MY
HOME STATE FOR THE PAST YEAR. THE LAST EIGHT YEARS HAVE<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> BEEN A
WAKE-UP CALL TO AMERICAN JEWS.
MORE FEEL AS I DO, THAT THERE IS
SOMETHING WRONG WITH AMERICA'S LEADERSHIP TODAY. A NEW DIRECTION IS NEEDED,
PARTICULARLY ON THE MANY ISSUES
IMPORTANT TO JEWISH AMERICANS. AT HOME, WE ARE APPROACHING $20
TRILLION IN DEBT. MORE ADULTS THAN EVER ARE WORKING AND PUBLIC EDUCATION IN
OUR CITIES IS IN TATTERS. THE SOCIAL COMPACT AT THE
FOUNDATION OF OUR DEMOCRACY IS BEING SHREDDED. THESE ARE THE DIRECT RESULT OF
FAILED POLICIES. TODAY, OUR COUNTRY IS MORE
DIVIDED THAN EVER AND OUR NATIONAL SECURITY IS THREATENED. DEMOCRATS REFUSE TO EVEN CALL SOURCES OF SO MUCH OF THIS VIOLENCE BY ITS NAME OR TO ACKNOWLEDGE ITS CAUSE. WHEN IT COMES TO ENGAGING WITH A WORLD, AMERICA SHOULD DEFEND OUR
NATIONAL INTERESTS AND OUR ALLIES FIRST. CLINTON AND OBAMA HAVE TREATED OUR ALLIES AS STRANGERS,
INSULTED THEIR LEADERS, AND
IGNORED THEIR ADVICE AND INTERESTS. LET'S COMPARE THE POSITIONS OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY ON ISRAEL.
ON ONE ISSUE AFTER ANOTHER, FROM BOYCOTT, DAVIS MEANT SANCTIONS
TO THE IRAN NUCLEAR AGREEMENT,
TO THE VERY LEGITIMACY OF
ISRAEL, THEY ARE DIVIDED. WITH THOSE WHO DON'T CARE FOR ISRAEL GETTING STRONGER IN THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY. YOU WILL FIND NO SUCH DIVISION
IN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY'S
LEADERSHIP.
[APPLAUSE] WITH UNANIMITY, WE PASSED A PLATFORM SUPPORTING A UNITED JERUSALEM, CONDEMNING EBF AND
CALLING IT WHAT IT IS,
ANTI-SEMITISM.
[APPLAUSE] WE REINFORCED OUR CONSISTENT OPPOSITION TO THE IRAN NUCLEAR AGREEMENT. ALONG WITH MANY OTHER POLICIES
OF THIS ADMINISTRATION, THAT
AGREEMENT IS PROPPING UP THE WORLD LEADING STATE SPONSOR OF TERRORISM, INCLUDING PROXIES LIKE HEZBOLLAH WITH 150,000 ROCKETS POINTED AT ISRAEL, POISED TO STRIKE. IF THIS WORRIES YOU, YOU ARE NOT
ALONE. YOU ARE PART OF A MOVEMENT.
THIS INCLUDES AMERICAN JEWS WHO IN FIVE OF THE LAST SIX
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS HAVE SUPPORTED THE REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE IN
INCREASING NUMBERS.
[APPLAUSE] THE SUPPORT FOR REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES BY
JEWISH AMERICANS HAVE TRIPLED OVER THE PAST 35 YEARS -- PAST 25 YEARS. REPUBLICAN LEADERSHIP IN THE
HOUSE, THE SENATE, AND ACROSS THE COUNTRY HAS EARNED IT YOUR TRUST ON THE ISSUES OF
IMPORTANCE TO ALL OF US. JOIN US AS WE WORK TOGETHER WITH
OUR PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE,
DONALD TRUMP AND VICE PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE MIKE PENCE TO MAKE AMERICA GREAT
AGAIN.

THE SUM OF ITS PARTS. SO IT IS WITH OUR REPUBLICAN PARTY. EVERY PART, EVERY OFFICE, EVERY
LEVEL<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> OF GOVERNMENT DETERMINES
THE STRENGTH OF THE WHOLE.
THINK ABOUT THAT. EVERY OFFICE AND EVERY LEVEL OF
GOVERNMENT DETERMINES THE
STRENGTH OF THE WHOLE. THUS, WE ARE HERE AND PUT IN CHARGE OF ELECTING DONALD TRUMP
AS PRESIDENT AND MIKE PENCE AS
VICE PRESIDENT AND GIVING THEM
REPUBLICAN PARTNERS AT ALL
LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT.
[APPLAUSE] 438 YEARS, GO PAC HAS LED IN
ENERGIZING AND ELECT THERE'S -- ELECTING GENERATIONS OF
REPUBLICAN LEADERS. 34 OF 50 REPUBLICAN GOVERNORS AND 69 OF 99 STATE LEGISLATIVE CHAMBERS. YOU MIGHT RECOGNIZE SOME OF OUR
ALUMNI. U.S. SENATORS JONI ERNST, THOM TILLIS, AND MARCO RUBIO. EACH IS A SHINING EXAMPLE OF WHY
THE FUTURE OF THE CONSERVATIVE MOVEMENT IS STRONGER THAN EVER. REPUBLICANS ARE CHAMPIONING IDEAS TO MAKE AMERICA SAFER, BOTH ON PERSONAL AND ECONOMIC
SECURITY. AS ELECTION DAY APPROACHES, WE MUST MAKE IT CRYSTAL CLEAR THAT UNLIKE HILLARY CLINTON, WE ARE
FOR A TAX SYSTEM THAT TAKES LESS
FROM AMERICANS SO THEY CAN
INVEST AND ENJOY THEIR HARD-EARNED MONEY. WE ARE FOR INDIVIDUALS HAVING THE CAREER FLEXIBILITY TO CHART
THEIR OWN COURSE AND PERHAPS INVENT SOMETHING THAT WOULD
CHANGE THE WORLD. WE ARE FOR INCREASING OUR CYBER
SECURITY EFFORTS TO PREVENT TAX THAT TARGET OUR NATION'S INFRASTRUCTURE AND EXPOSE OUR
PERSONAL DATA. WE ARE FOR PROTECTING OUR COMMUNITIES AND HEINOUS AND
UNNECESSARY ATTACKS AND, UNLIKE HILLARY CLINTON, WE ARE FOR
SECURING OUR BORDERS, DEFUNDING SANCTUARY CITIES AND DEPORTING
THOSE WHO COMMIT CRIME. THESE IDEALS ARE WHAT AMERICANS WANT AS THEY DIRECTLY IMPACT AND
IMPROVE OUR LIVES. WITH DONALD TRUMP AS PRESIDENT
AND REPUBLICANS AT ALL LEVELS OF
GOVERNMENT, THE SUM OF OUR PARTS WILL, AS A WHOLE, MAKE AMERICA
SAFER THAN IT HAS EVER BEEN. THANK YOU.

<strong>Libby Szabo</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> HELLO.
IT IS AN HONOR TO HAVE THE
OPPORTUNITY TO STAND ON THE SAME STAGE WHERE MANY OTHER GREAT
AMERICANS WILL STAND THE NEXT
FEW DAYS. I WOULD LIKE<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> TO TELL YOU A
LITTLE BIT ABOUT MY AMERICAN DREAMS.
IT STARTED ON THE LEFT SIDE OF UNDER WHERE MY MOM KNEW THE IMPORTANCE OF PRESERVING MY
LATINA HERITAGE, BUT ALWAYS MADE SURE I KNEW I WAS AN AMERICAN. WE BELIEVED IN HONESTY, INTEGRITY, AND THAT IF WE WORK HARD AND MADE THE METS -- MADE
THE MOST OF OUR OPPORTUNITIES,
WE WOULD PROSPER. WE PRIDE OURSELVES IN EARNING OUR WAYS AND NOT GETTING ANYTHING HANDED TO US. I WAS TAUGHT TO OBEY THE RULES
EVEN WHEN I DIDN'T LIKE THEM. NOW, AS AN ELECTED OFFICIAL CHARGED WITH MAKING THE RULES,
I'M EVEN MORE AWARE THAT NOT
FOLLOWING THEM SHOWS A LACK OF INTEGRITY. SADLY, WE ALL KNOW WHO THINKS SHE IS ABOVE THE RULES. WE HAVE STRONG BELIEFS IN GOD AND AMERICA. WE VALUE LIFE AND THE LISTINGS OF OUR LIBERTY. WE PURSUE OUR OWN HAPPINESS. IT WAS NEVER GIVEN TO US.
WE EARNED IT. IF WE WANT TO PRESERVE THE WAY
OF LIFE MY PARENTS AND
GRANDPARENTS MADE POSSIBLE FOR
ME AND SO MANY OTHERS, WE CANNOT HAVE ANOTHER FOUR YEARS. HILLARY CLINTON WOULD GIVE US JUST THAT. ALTHOUGH SHE TRIES TO DISGUISE IT IN A BRIGHTLY COLORED
PANTSUIT. WE NEED NEW LEADERSHIP, BOLD LEADERSHIP WILLING TO TACKLE EVERYTHING FROM NATIONAL SECURITY TO OUR ENERGY
INDEPENDENCE. LEADERSHIP THAT UNDERSTANDS WE,
THE PEOPLE ARE THE ANSWERS TO
OUR PROBLEMS, NOT THE
GOVERNMENT.
[APPLAUSE] THE CHOICE IS OURS.
AS RONALD REAGAN SO ELOQUENTLY SAID, AMERICA WEST BEST DAYS ARE
YET TO COME. OUR PROUDEST MOMENTS ARE YET TO BE. OUR MOST GLORIOUS ACHIEVEMENTS ARE JUST AHEAD. IF YOU BELIEVE THAT AS I DO, LET US MAKE AMERICA GREAT. GOD BLESS YOU AND GOD BLESS
AMERICA.

<p class='short_transcript'> >> GOOD AFTERNOON. THIS ELECTION, YOUNG PEOPLE FACE A HISTORIC CHOICE WITH CONSEQUENCES NOT JUST FOR US, BUT FOR THE GENERATION OF FUTURE AMERICANS. FOR<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> POLICIES THAT IN TIES YOUNG
VOTERS BELIEVE THEM IN PAIN FOR A LONG RUN, DEMOCRATS LOST THEIR
MONOPOLY ON USE SUPPORT IN
AMERICA. THEY PROMISE FREE COLLEGE TUITION BUT DON'T TELL YOU IT
WILL LOWER THE QUALITY OF EDUCATION AND COST HALF $1
TRILLION.
THEY PROMISE MINIMUM WAGE OF $15 BUT THEY DON'T TELL YOU IT WILL MEAN FEWER DOLLARS WHEN
COMPANIES HAVE LESS MONEY TO PAY EMPLOYEES. AND WHY WOULD THEY CONSIDER THE
CONSEQUENCES? THEIR NOMINEE FOR PRESIDENT HAS
MADE A CAREER OF SHOWING TERRIBLE JUDGMENT AND WATCHING
OTHERS PAY FOR IT. REPUBLICAN FACE AN UPHILL WITH YOUNG AMERICANS. IN CONTRAST, THE PARTY OF UNICORNS AND FAIRYTALES, WE ARE
THE PARTY OF REALITY. WE KNOW FREE MARKETS ARE BETTER THAN FREE STUFF. WE KNOW BIG GOVERNMENT SOLUTIONS RARELY DELIVER BIG SUCCESS. THERE'S NO BETTER ILLUSTRATION OF THE AMERICAN DREAM WE ARE
FIGHTING FOR THAN DONALD TRUMP
AND GOVERNOR MIKE PENCE. THEY HAVE MADE CAREERS OUT OF
PROVING FREE MARKETS AND FREE SOCIETY ARE THE GREATEST KEY TO BOTH SUCCESS, BUSINESS, AND FOR THE GREAT STATE OF INDIANA. THIS NOVEMBER, I ASKED MY FELLOW
YOUNG AMERICANS ACROSS THE
COUNTRY TO STAND WITH US, VISIT US ONLINE. WE WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT
AGAIN. THANK YOU AND GOD LESS UNITED
STATES OF AMERICA.
-- GOD BLESS THESE UNITED STATES
OF AMERICA.</span><span class='hidden-full-transcript-ellipses'>...</span></p><a href='#' class='hidden-full-transcript-link'><i class='icon-chevron-down'></i> <span class='link-show-full-text'>Show Full Text</span><i class='icon-chevron-up'></i> <span class='link-show-less-text'>Show Less Text</span></a>

<p class='short_transcript'> >> WHAT A SIGHT. IT IS GREAT TO BE BACK IN CLEVELAND AND I'M LOOKING FOR
THE OKLAHOMA CONTINGENT. I'M VERY PLEASED TO BE HERE. MY THANKS TO THE REPUBLICAN
PARTY<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> AND ITS NOMINEE, DONALD J
TRUMP FOR INVITING ME TO SPEAK TO HIGHLIGHT THE GREAT WORK
GOING ON AROUND THE COUNTRY BY
REPUBLICAN MAYORS. IT WAS JUST THREE YEARS AGO THAT
WOULD AGO, THE NEWSPAPER THAT
COVERS NATIONAL POLITICS
PUBLISHED AND ARTICLE THAT
IMPLIED MAYORS ACROSS THE COMPANY WERE NO LONGER
REPUBLICANS. WE WERE NO LONGER LEADING IN
AMERICA UPON DIGG CITIES. BUT TAKE A LOOK AROUND,
REPUBLICAN MAYORS ARE BACK. FROM SAN DIEGO, FRESNO, ANAHEIM AND ALBUQUERQUE, ACROSS THE COUNTRY TO VIRGINIA BEACH AND
JACKSONVILLE AND MIAMI, REPUBLICAN MAYORS ARE THRIVING.
OVER 150 CITIES IN ALL. IN THE HEARTLAND, REPUBLICAN MAYORS HOLD OFFICE IN FORT WORTH
, IN OMAHA, WICHITA, IN TULSA,
AND YES, IN MY HOMETOWN OF OKLAHOMA CITY, WHERE REPUBLICANS HAVE HELD THE MAYORS SEATS FOR
29 CONSECUTIVE YEARS. IS IT ANY WONDER THE COST AND FOUNDATION NAMED OKLAHOMA CITY
NAME THE CITY IS THE MOST STARTUPS ARE CAP AND A AND ONE
OF THE CITIES WITH THE NATION'S
LOWEST UNEMPLOYMENT RATES MARK
OUTSIDE OF THE URBAN CORE,
REPUBLICAN MAYORS ARE FINDING
SUCCESS IN SUBURBIA, FAST GROWING CITIES IN TEXAS LIKE IRVING AND PLANO AND FRESNO, WHERE HIGH PAYING JOBS ARE
ATTRACTING THE NEXT GENERATION. REPUBLICAN MAYORS ARE RESTORING THE MIDDLE CLASS. REPUBLICAN MAYORS ARE RESTORING THE AMERICAN DREAM. WE ARE BUILDING CITIES WHERE MILLENNIALS ARE CHOOSING TO LIVE. WE ARE INVESTING IN PUBLIC
SAFETY AND STREETS AND PARKS. WE ARE HELPING TO RESTORE
CONFIDENCE IN AMERICA. LAST MONTH, I BECAME THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
CONFERENCE OF MAYORS. I HAVE SEEN REPUBLICAN MAYORS UP CLOSE TAKE ON SOME OF THE MOST ENTRENCHED CHALLENGES UNIMAGINABLE, AND I HAVE SEEN
THEM TIME AND TIME AGAIN CREATIVELY DELIVER SOLUTIONS AND
SUCCESS STORIES. REPUBLICAN MAYORS ARE EGG GROWING FORCE WITHIN THE
CONFERENCE OF MAYORS AND A
GROWING FORCE IN AMERICA AND WE
WILL CONTINUE TO GROW. SO, STAY TUNED.
A REPUBLICAN MAYOR MAY SOON BE
COMING TO A CITY NEAR YOU. THANK YOU AND GOOD AFTERNOON.

<p class='short_transcript'> >> GOOD AFTERNOON. IT'S AN HONOR FOR ME TO ADDRESS YOU, REPRESENTING ALL REPUBLICAN COUNTY A LOOK AT OFFICIALS
ACROSS AMERICA. ON BEHALF OF THE NATIONAL<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> CONFERENCE OF REPUBLICAN COUNTY OFFICIALS, WE BELIEVE THE MOST
EFFECTIVE GOVERNMENT IS THE ONE
CLOSEST TO THE PEOPLE, COUNTY
ELECTED OFFICERS. IN MY MID-FLORIDA COUNTY,
REPUBLICAN VOTER REGISTRATION HAS NEVER ACHIEVED A MAJORITY IN
100 YEARS, YET ALL OF OUR COUNTY
ALIKE IT OFFICERS ARE
REPUBLICAN. WHY IS THAT?
BECAUSE WE ATTRACT THE INDEPENDENT VOTERS AND THOSE IN
THE CONSERVATIVE DEMOCRATIC FAMILY VALUES GROUP HELP US WIN
GENERAL ELECTIONS. VOTERS KNOW LOCAL OFFICIALS CARRY OUT THEIR RESPONSIBILITY WITH EFFICIENCY AND WITHIN OUR
FINANCIAL RESOURCES. EACH OF US UNDERSTAND THE THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO MUST BE TREATED
WITH DIGNITY AND THEIR OPINION MUST BE HEARD AND RESPECTED. WHAT WE DO IN FLORIDA IS DUPLICATED BY OTHER TOWN D
OFFICIALS ACROSS THE COUNTRY. WE TREAT OUR PEOPLE WITH RESPECT, WE ARE RECEPTIVE TO NEW IDEAS, YET WITHOUT COMPROMISE OF
OUR CORE PRINCIPLES AND MORAL
VALUES. LET US AS DELEGATES CONFIRM IN
OUR PLATFORM THAT WE ARE THE
ONLY POLITICAL PARTY OF THE
PEOPLE AND FOR THE PEOPLE.
IN NOVEMBER, BUT WHAT YOU KNOW
IS THE RIGHT CHOICE FOR OUR
COUNTIES AND COUNTRY. VOTE REPUBLICAN.

TO SHOW FOR IT.
UNDER REPUBLICAN LEADERSHIP, WE HAVE KEPT STRONGER DEFENSE, SAFER HIGHWAYS, SAFER SKIES, AND
BETTER ENERGY POLICIES FOR A BETTER ECONOMY. BECAUSE OF SENATORS LIKE ROB
PORTMAN AND KELLY AYOTTE, WE HAVE ADDRESSED NATIONAL CRISES
LIKE OPIOID ADDICTION. BECAUSE OF SENATORS LIKE ROY BLUNT AND MARCO RUBIO, WE ARE
TAKING ACTION AGAINST SERIOUS PUBLIC HEALTH THREATS LIKE THE GOT -- LIKE ZIKA. BECAUSE OF SENATORS LIKE MARK KIRK AND JOHNNY ISAKSON, WE ARE
PROVIDING BETTER CARE AND
BENEFITS FROM OUR -- FOR OUR VETERANS.
BECAUSE OF SENATORS LIKE PAT
TOOMEY, WE ARE ENSURING WE HAVE
THE RIGHT POLICIES IN PLACE TO FIGHT CRIME. AND BECAUSE OF SENATORS LIKE RON
JOHNSON AND JOHN MCCAIN, WE ARE
PUSHING BACK AGAINST THE FAILED FOREIGN POLICY OF THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION. SENATE REPUBLICANS HAVE
RESPONDED TO INTERNATIONAL THREATS FROM ROGUE STATES LIKE NORTH KOREA TO INCREASINGLY
SOPHISTICATED CYBER ATTACKS.
WE HAVE WORKED TO PROTECT
VICTIMS OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING. WE HAVE ACTUALLY CUT DISCRETIONARY PENDING --
SPENDING, PUT TOGETHER A BUDGET THAT BALANCES IN 10 YEARS, AND
SUCCEEDED IN ACHIEVING LONG-TERM TAX RELIEF FOR THE MIDDLE CLASS. WE PASSED THE FIRST REPEAL OF OBAMACARE. OF COURSE, THE PRESIDENT VETOED THAT BILL, BUT WE KEPT A PROMISE
AND DESIGNED A BLUEPRINT TO SHOW HOW REPEALING AND REPLACING OBAMACARE CAN AND WILL BE DONE. WE DON'T ALWAYS FIND AGREEMENT
IN A DIVIDED GOVERNMENT, BUT WE
HAVE REFUSED TO SETTLE FOR
GRIDLOCK. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE DESERVE BETTER THAN THAT AND WE HAVE
MORE WORK TO DO. MY FELLOW AMERICANS, THE STAKES OF THIS ELECTION ARE HIGH. WHEN DONALD TRUMP IS ELECTED
PRESIDENT, HE WILL DETERMINE THE
FUTURE OF THE SUPREME COURT AND
HE WILL LEAD OUR TROOPS AS
COMMANDER IN CHIEF.
HE WILL SHEPHERD ECONOMIC POLICIES THAT DIRECTLY IMPACT AMERICAN JOBS AND LIVELIHOODS
AND FAMILIES. HE AND VICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE WILL NEED A REPUBLICAN SENATE TO
GET THAT JOB DONE. REPUBLICAN SENATORS HAVE WHAT
OUR NATION NEEDS AT THIS CRITICAL MOMENT. WE HAVE WHAT PRESIDENT TRUMP
WILL NEED. AND WE WILL SUCCEED IN NOVEMBER.
[APPLAUSE] AND NOW, IT IS WITH GREAT PLEASURE THAT I INTRODUCE OUR NEXT SPEAKER. HE COMES TO US TODAY FROM DODGE
CITY, IN THE GREAT STATE OF KANSAS, SENATOR PAT ROBERTS,
ATTESTED, TRUSTED, AND TRUE
CONSERVATIVE, WHO BRINGS PRACTICAL MIDWESTERN VALUES TO WASHINGTON. AS A POWERFUL AND EFFECTIVE
LEADER, SENATOR PAT ROBERTS CHAIRED THE AGRICULTURAL
COMMITTEE. HE WORKS TO CUT RUNAWAY SPENDING
BY GOVERNMENT OVERREACH AND
PROTECT OUR FREEDOMS. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, PLEASE
JOIN ME IN GIVING A WARM REPUBLICAN WELCOME TO SENATOR PAT ROBERTS OF KANSAS!

<strong>Pat Roberts</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> SEN,.. ROBERTS: HELLO, KANSAS. I'M PAT ROBERTS. AND I'M PROUD TO REPRESENT THE
PEOPLE OF KANSAS IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE, AND I'M GLAD TO
BE IN OHIO,<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> A SPECIAL PLACE FOR MY FAMILY'S HISTORY. IT WAS HERE 160 YEARS AGO THAT MY GREAT-GRANDFATHER, JOHN
WESLEY ROBERTS, AND OHIO NEWSPAPER EDITORS STOOD ON THE BANKS OF THE OHIO RIVER AND LOOKED SOUTH TO A NATION, A
NATION IN TURMOIL. JOHN WESLEY HAD LITTLE PATIENCE
FOR THINGS AS THEY WERE. HE SHIPPED A FLATBED TO KANSAS, WHERE HE BECAME A FIGHTER FOR
ABOLITION AND FREEDOM WITHIN OUR NEWLY-BORN REPUBLICAN PARTY. HE WOULD KNOW FEAR. HE WOULD LIVE WITH VIOLENCE. BUT AS A FRONTIER EDITOR, HE
SPOKE TO THE TRUTH AND HEALTH
KANSAS -- AND HELPED KANSAS MAKE
A FREE STATE. JOHN WESLEY HAD A VISION OF WHAT
AMERICA SHOULD, COULD BE, WITH THE YOUNG NATION ON THE EDGE OF CHAOS.
HE HAD THE TEMERITY TO LOOK TO A BETTER FUTURE AND A FIGHT FOR
FREEDOM -- AND TO FIGHT FOR FREEDOM.
TODAY, WE, TOO, ARE LIVING IN A
TIME OF GREAT SELF-DOUBT.
WE ARE LIVING IN A TIME WITH
LEADERS WHO HAVE LITTLE PATIENCE
FOR THINGS JUST AS THEY ARE. HILLARY CLINTON AND THE
DEMOCRATS HAVE CHANGED OUR
GOVERNMENT.
THEY HAVE TAXED US. THEY HAVE REGULATED US. THEY HAVE DESTROYED OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. THEY HAVE STUNNED OUR ECONOMY AND KILLED NEW JOBS. THEY HAVE MADE OUR WORLD AND OUR COUNTRY LESS SAFE. AS THE SENIOR MARINE IN THE CONGRESS, I BELIEVE THAT HILLARY
CLINTON FAILED TO PROTECT
AMERICAN LIVES IN BENGHAZI.
[APPLAUSE] NOW, WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT
MAKE? WELL, TODAY, THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO SERVE OUR NATION IN HARM'S WAY DO NOT FEEL THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT HAS THEIR
BACK. HILLARY CLINTON HAS REPEATEDLY SIDESTEPPED THE TRUTH AND WILL
DO IT AGAIN. ARE WE REALLY READY TO ACCEPT A DIFFERENT STANDARD FOR THE ELITES THAN FOR THE REST OF US? BUT THAT DECISION WILL NO LONGER BE MADE BY A CONFUSED FBI OR THE ADMINISTRATION'S DEPARTMENT OF
JUSTICE. IT WILL BE UP TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. IT WILL BE UP TO US IN
NOVEMBER. IN KANSAS, AS MANY STATES THROUGHOUT AMERICA, OUR RURAL
WAY OF LIFE AND OUR FAMILY
VALUES ARE UNDER ATTACK BY AN OVERZEALOUS FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. NO ONE KNOWS THAT BETTER THAN
FARMERS AND RANCHERS AND
GROWERS. THE OBAMA-CLINTON ADMINISTRATION HAS MADE THEIR JOB NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE WITH REGULATION. THEY ACTUALLY FEEL RULED, NOT GOVERNED. WE NEED A CHAMPION FOR RURAL AND SMALL-TOWN AMERICA WHO WILL LIFT
THE YOKE OF REGULATION, AND WE HAVE ONE, VICE PRESIDENT MIKE
PENCE.
[APPLAUSE] AND I'M SO GLAD THAT OUR NEXT
PRESIDENT SHOWED GREAT JUDGMENT IN THIS ELECTION -- SELECTION. SO, TODAY, WE, TOO, ARE JUST LIKE MY GREAT-GRANDFATHER STANDING HERE IN OHIO, LOOKING
AT OUR NATION, FEARFUL ABOUT
WHAT WE SEE. FOR YEARS, THE DEMOCRATS PARTY'S PRIMARY OBJECTIVE GOAL -- TO
OBTAIN POWER -- HAS BEEN SOMETHING CALLED "IDENTITY POLITICS," DIVIDING THE AMERICAN
PEOPLE BY RACE, BY GENDER, BY
AGE, AND NOW EVEN SEX, LEADING
TO MORE DIVISIVENESS AND
FRIGHTENING LAWLESSNESS
TARGETING OUR NATION'S POLICE.
ENOUGH OF THE IDENTITY POLITICS.
WE ARE ALL AMERICANS. LET US EMBRACE THAT BASIC
PREMISE. LET'S MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN! WE IN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY NEED A LEADER WITH VISION WHO SEES A BETTER FUTURE. WE NEED A PRESIDENT WHO WILL
RESTORE OUR ECONOMY AND OUR SECURITY.
AND WE NEED A LEADER WHO WILL RESPECT THE CONSTITUTION OF THE
UNITED STATES. WE NEED SOMEONE WHO WILL GET THE JOB DONE.
WE NEED A BUILDER AND A DOER.
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WE NEED DONALD TRUMP AND WE NEED A
REPUBLICAN SENATE AND HOUSE TO
BACK HIM UP. IN ESSENCE, WE NEED YOUR HELP TO
TAKE OUR COUNTRY BACK, EACH AND
EVERY ONE OF YOU.
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

<strong>Greg Walden</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> REP. WALDEN: HEY, GOOD AFTERNOON.
I'M THRILLED TO BE IN CLEVELAND
AS WE WORK TOGETHER TO RETAKE THE WHITE HOUSE AND PUT AMERICA BACK ON THE RIGHT TRACK.<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> OVER THE LAST EIGHT YEARS -- OVER THE LAST EIGHT YEARS, HOUSE REPUBLICANS HAVE ACTED AS THE FIRST LINE OF DEFENSE AGAINST THE DESTRUCTIVE POLICIES THE
OBAMA ADMINISTRATION. DURING PRESIDENT OBAMA'S FIRST
TWO YEARS IN OFFICE, DEMOCRATS
CONTROLLED BOTH HOUSES OF CONGRESS AND WE ALL SAW THE
RESULTS OF THAT. LOWER DEFICIT SPENDING, HIGHER TAXES, AND A GOVERNMENT TAKEOVER
OF HEALTH CARE.
IN 2010, YOU HELPED US TURN THAT
TIDE. AS CHAIRMAN OF THE NATIONAL
REPUBLICAN CONGRESSIONAL COMMITTEE, MY JOB IS TO ELECT
REPUBLICANS TO THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES, AND I'M PROUD TO TELL YOU THAT, FROM MAINE TO
MIAMI, FROM ARIZONA TO ALASKA,
WE HAVE ELECTED REPUBLICANS TO
THE HOUSE AND NOW HOLD OUR
LARGEST MAJORITY SINCE THE 1920'S.
[APPLAUSE] SINCE THAT TIME, WE'VE DONE
EVERYTHING IN OUR POWER TO BLOCK
THE LIBERAL AGENDA AND BEGIN REINING IN DEFICIT SPENDING. PRESIDENT OBAMA, INSTEAD OF
WORKING WITH CONGRESS, HAS CONTINUED PUSHING HIS EXTREME
PARTISAN POLICY THROUGH AN
UNPRECEDENTED LEVEL OF EXECUTIVE
AND REGULATORY OVERREACH.
WE FIND HIM IN CONGRESS. WE FOUGHT HIM IN CONGRESS AND IN
THE COURTS. WE ARE BEGINNING TO WIN.
WE ARE GOING TO WIN THIS FALL. OF COURSE, ANY DISCUSSION OF
PRESIDENT OBAMA'S FAILURES HAVE TO START WITH OBAMACARE. UNDER THIS FLAWED LAW, HEALTH
CARE HAS BECOME ANYTHING BUT
AFFORDABLE. INSURANCE PREMIUMS AND HEALTH CARE COSTS -- THEY'VE SKYROCKETED. ANOTHER ROUND OF DOUBLE-DIGIT RATE HIKES ARE SET TO HIT CONSUMERS THIS  NOVEMBER. OBAMACARE IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN A
PRESIDENT CARES MORE ABOUT SECURING A POLITICAL WIN THAN SETTING GOOD POLICY FOR OUR
COUNTRY. IN CONTRAST, SPEAKER PAUL RYAN'S
LEADERSHIP, HOUSE REPUBLICANS HAVE PUT FORWARD PATIENT
-CENTERED HEALTH CARE THAT WILL
BE AFFORDABLE FOR FAMILIES. WE ARE OFFERING A REAL
ALTERNATIVE AND SHOWING VOTERS THAT REPUBLICANS ARE THE PARTY
OF NEW AND GOOD IDEAS, WHILE DEMOCRATS ARE CLEARLY THE PARTY OF THE FAILED STATUS QUO, ESPECIALLY ON HEALTH CARE. DONALD TRUMP WILL BE OUR PARTNER
IN THIS EFFORT AND, TOGETHER, WE
WILL REPLACE OBAMACARE WITH REAL
HEALTH CARE REFORM THAT WORKS
FOR ALL AMERICANS. BUT, YOU KNOW WHAT? OBAMACARE IS JUST THE TIP OF THE
ICEBERG WHEN IT COMES TO THE
OBAMA ADMINISTRATION'S OVERREACH. AS MY FRIENDS FROM THE OREGON
DELEGATION KNOW, IN MY DISTRICT,
OVER HALF THE LAND BASES
CONTROLLED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT, DECISIONS BY
UNELECTED BUREAUCRATS THOUSANDS
OF MILES AWAY IN WASHINGTON,
D.C., HAVE A LEVEL OF INFLUENCE
OVER THE PEOPLE THAT IS
UNIMAGINABLE TO MOST PARTS OF
OUR NATION. THESE ARE OUR PUBLIC LANDS AND
WE MUST PROVIDE BETTER
STEWARDSHIP OF THEM. HOUSE REPUBLICANS ARE LEADING THE FIGHT AGAINST THE OBAMA-CLINTON REGULATORY REGIME. AND WE KNOW THERE'S A BETTER SOLUTION. WASHINGTON NEEDS TO BE A BETTER
LISTENER. WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND FROM ALL PEOPLE, WITH ALL WALKS OF LIFE,
ALL REGIONS OF OUR COUNTRY, THAT
THE REAL SOLUTIONS START AT THE GRASS LEVEL.
HILLARY CLINTON HAS MADE CLEAR
THAT SHE WILL DOUBLE DOWN ON THE WORST OF THE OBAMA-ERA POLICIES AND, INDEED, GO EVEN FURTHER, ADVOCATING FOR THE MOST EXTREME
LEFT-WING DEMOCRAT PLATFORM
AMERICA HAS EVER SEEN. IT'S TIME TO MOVE OUR COUNTRY IN
A NEW DIRECTION, TO START
CREATING JOBS INSTEAD OF KILLING THEM, AND TO GROW OUR ECONOMY BY ENCOURAGING INNOVATION INSTEAD
OF STIFLING IT WITH OVERREGULATION. AS PRESIDENT RONALD REAGAN ONCE SAID, "THERE ARE NO GREAT LIMITS TO GROWTH, BECAUSE THERE ARE NO LIMITS OF HUMAN INTELLIGENCE, IMAGINATION, AND WONDER." SO I HOPE YOU WILL JOIN WITH US
IN BUILDING ON A REPUBLICAN HOUSE MAJORITY.
VISIT OUR WEBSITE AT NRCC.ORG TO LEARN MORE ABOUT OUR EFFORTS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR WHAT YOU
DO.
GOD BLESS YOU, AND GOD BLESS THE
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.

BERGERON OF NEW HAMPSHIRE, JIM DICKIE OF OHIO, STEVE PRICE OF RHODE ISLAND, GLENN OF SOUTH CAROLINA, AND FREDDIE SIMPSON OF
WASHINGTON. REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE IS MEANT TO CONSIDER CONTEST
ORIGINATING FROM THE STATE OF COLORADO AND ILLINOIS.
THE COMMITTEE ISSUED
RECOMMENDATIONS WHICH WERE
SUBMITTED TO THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE ON JULY 11,
2016. THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL
COMMITTEE ADOPTED THE COMMITTEE CONTEST RECOMMENDATIONS WHICH WERE INCORPORATED INTO THE TEMPORARY ROLE AND FORWARDED TO
THE TEMPORARY CONVENTION COMMITTEE ON CREDENTIALS. TWO APPEALS FROM THE STATE OF CORAL COLORADO AND THE DISTRICT
OF COLUMBIA WERE TAKEN BEFORE THIS MIDI.
IN THE COLORADO CONTEST OF THE
CREDENTIALS COMMITTEE ADOPTED
REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE'S RECOMMENDATION TO SEE THE
CONTESTED AT-LARGE DELEGATE AND
ALTERNATE DELEGATES. IN THE MANNER IN WHICH THE COLORADO REPUBLICAN COMMITTEE SELECTED ITS NATIONAL CONVENTION DELEGATES AT LARGE AND ALTERNATES WAS HARDLY A MODEL OF EXCELLENCE AND ELECTION ADMINISTRATION. THE COMMITTEE HAS SERIOUS CONCERNS REGARDING THE CHOSEN BALLOTING PROCESS. THE COMMITTEE SUGGESTS THE STATE
PARTY EVALUATE THEIR PROCESS AND MAKE ADJUSTMENTS TO PREVENT SIMILAR BALLOTING IRREGULARITIES
IN THE FUTURE.
[APPLAUSE] THE COMMITTEE EXERCISES THIS
DISCRETION TO FASHION THE
EQUITABLE REMEDY DESIGNED TO
RENDER A JUST RESULT FOR THE PARTIES PROVIDED WITH CONTESTANTS WITH GUEST PASSES SO THAT ALTHOUGH NOT ATTENDING AS DELEGATES, THAT THEY CAN BE PART
OF THIS GREAT CONVENTION. IN A DISTRICT OF KUMBAYA
CONTEST, THE CREDENTIALS COMMITTEE DID NOT ADOPT THE
REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE'S RECOMMENDATION, AND INSTEAD
DECIDED TO SEEK THE CONTESTED AT-LARGE DELEGATES. THE COMMITTEE VOTED TO UPHOLD

<strong>John A. Barrasso</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> SEN. BARRASSO: THANK YOU. WHO IS PROUD TO BE AN AMERICAN?
[APPLAUSE] MY NAME IS JOHN BARRASSO, A
UNITED STATES SENATOR FROM THE
GREAT STATE OF WYOMING.<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> IT HAS BEEN MY HONOR TO SERVE
YOU AS CHAIRMAN OF THE PLATFORM
COMMITTEE. I WANT TO SAY FIRST, YOU CAN BE VERY PROUD OF THE DELEGATES THAT
YOU CHOSE TO REPRESENT YOU
DURING OUR COMMITTEE
PROCEEDINGS. THEY WERE TOUGH, INTELLIGENT, AND THEY WORK WITH GREAT
CIVILITY IN COMMON PURPOSE TO
WRITE A REPUBLICAN PLATFORM THAT
REAFFIRMS THE PRINCIPLES THAT
UNITE US. WHAT THEY ACHIEVED CAN BE
SUMMARIZED SIMPLY -- WE BELIEVE THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA IS
UNLIKE ANY OTHER NATION ON EARTH.
[APPLAUSE] WE BELIEVE AMERICA IS EXCEPTIONAL BECAUSE OF OUR HISTORIC ROLE, FIRST AS REFUGE,
THEN AS THE VENDOR, AND NOW AS
EXEMPLARY OF LIBERTY FOR THE
WORLD TO SEE. WE AFFIRM THEM AS TO THE
DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE,
THAT ALL ARE CREATED EQUAL,
ENDOWED BY THEIR CREATOR WITH AN
INALIENABLE RIGHTS TO LIFE, LIBERTY, AND THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS. WE BELIEVE IN THE CONSTITUTION
AS OUR FOUNDING DOCUMENT AND OUR
ENDURING COVENANT.
[APPLAUSE] WE BELIEVE OUR CONSTITUTIONAL SYSTEM, LIMITED GOVERNMENT,
SEPARATION OF POWERS,
FEDERALISM, AND THE RIGHTS OF
THE PEOPLE MUST BE PRESERVED
UNCOMPROMISED FOR FUTURE
GENERATIONS.
[APPLAUSE] WE BELIEVE THAT PEOPLE ARE THE ULTIMATE RESOURCE AND THAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE, NOT THE GOVERNMENT, ARE THE BEST
STEWARDS OF OUR COUNTRY'S GOD-GIVEN NATURAL RESOURCES. AS AMERICANS AND AS REPUBLICANS, WE WISH FOR PEACE SO THAT WE INSIST ON STRENGTH. WE SEEK FRIENDSHIP WITH ALL NATIONS, BUT WE BASED ON THESE PRINCIPLES, THIS PLATFORM IS AN INVITATION AND A
ROADMAP. IT INVITES EVERY AMERICAN TO JOIN US AND IT SHOWS THE PATH TO A STRONGER, SAFER AND MORE PROSPEROUS AMERICA. FOR THE PAST EIGHT YEARS,
AMERICA HAS BEEN LED IN THE WRONG DIRECTION. OUR ECONOMY HAS BECOME UNNECESSARILY WEAK. TWTOO MANY AMERICANS LIVE PAYCHECK TO PAYCHECK,
STRUGGLING, SUFFER SACRIFICING. WOROUR ENEMIES NO LONGER FEAR US AND OUR FRIENDS NO LONGER TRUST
US. THE MEN AND WOMEN OF OUR MILITARY REMAIN THE WORLD'S
BEST.
[APPLAUSE] THEY HAVE BEEN SHORTCHANGED IN NUMBERS, EQUIPMENT AND BENEFITS. THE PRESIDENT AND THE DEMOCRATIC
PARTY HAVE DISMANTLED AMERICA SYSTEM OF HEALTH CARE. THEY REPLACED IT WITH A COSTLY AND COMPLICATED SCHEME THAT LIMITS CHOICES AND TAKES AWAY
OUR FREEDOMS. THE PRESIDENT AND THE DEMOCRATIC
PARTY HAVE ABANDONED THEIR
PROMISE OF BEING ACCOUNTABLE. THEY REFUSE TO CONTROL OUR BORDERS, BUT TRY TO CONTROL OUR SCHOOLS, FARMS, BUSINESSES AND
EVEN OUR RELIGIOUS INSTITUTIONS.
[APPLAUSE] THEY HAVE DIRECTLY ATTACKED THE
PRODUCTION OF AMERICAN ENERGY AND THE JOBS THAT HAVE SUSTAINED FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES. THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN
REGULATING TO DEATH A FREE MARKET ECONOMY THAT HE DOES NOT LIKE AND DOES NOT UNDERSTAND. ALL THIS IS ALL TOO FAMILIAR. IT HARKENS BACK TO THE WORLD OF
1980, WHEN AN EQUALLY DISCREDITED PRESIDENCY WAS
CALLED TO ACCOUNT BY THE
AMERICAN ELECTORATE. OUR RESPONSE THEN WAS A REPUBLICAN PLATFORM WHICH TOLD
THE TRUTH. IT TOLD THE TRUTH ABOUT OUR
COUNTRY'S PERIL AND OUR NATIN ON'S PROSPECTS.W
DO THE WE DO THE SAME TODAY WITH THE SAME UNITY AND SAME COURAGE
SHOWED BY THOSE FOR SOME 36
YEARS AGO MADE THE REAGAN
PLATFORM A MANIFESTO OF OPPORTUNITY FOR EVERYONE.
[APPLAUSE] LET US REMEMBER AND REPEAT FOR A NEW ERA AND FOR NEW GENERATIONS THEIR CONCLUDING SUMMONS.
SO IN THIS REPUBLICAN PLATFORM, WE CALL OUT TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WITH GODS'S HELP, LET
US ALL NOW TOGETHER MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN.
[APPLAUSE] LET US NOW TOGETHER MAKE A NEW BEGINNING.
[APPLAUSE] AND NOW, PLEASE JOIN ME IN WELCOMING ONE OF THE COCHAIRS OF
THE PLATFORM COMMITTEE, THE
GOVERNOR OF THE GREAT STATE OF OKLAHOMA, GOVERNOR MARY FALLIN.

<strong>Mary Fallin</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> GOV. FALLIN: THANK YOU, SENATOR. I HAVE ONE QUESTION. WHO OUT THERE IS AN AMERICAN PATRIOT WHO IS WILLING TO STAND UP AND FIGHT TO MAKE OUR COUNTRY
GREAT<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> AGAIN?
[APPLAUSE] ABSOLUTELY, ABSOLUTELY. IT HAS BEEN A GREAT PLEASURE AND HONOR TO HAVE SERVED AS THE
COCHAIR OF THIS YEAR'S PLATFORM COMMITTEE WITH OUR CHAIRMAN
SENATOR JOHN GRASSO AND OUR COCHAIRMAN CONGRESSWOMAN VIRGINIA FOXX. WE HAVE ACCOMPLISHED WHAT A LOT
HAVE THOUGHT WAS IMPOSSIBLE. WE HAVE COME TOGETHER WITH ONE
PARTY AND WHAT PLATFORM -- ONE
PLATFORM WITH A WIDE RANGE OF
VIEWS AND POLICIES. A WINNING AND CONSERVATIVE
PLATFORM AND A PATH FORWARD FOR
NOT JUST OUR PARTY BUT FOR THE
ENTIRE NATION. THE PLATFORM IS AMONG THE MOST IMPORTANT WORK WE DO AS A PARTY. IT IS A REFLECTION OF WHO WE ARE
AND WHAT WE STAND FOR, AND PERHAPS MORE THAN ANY OTHER
SINGLE DOCUMENT WE COULD
PRODUCE, IT CAN CHANGE THE WAY PEOPLE THINK IN THE DIRECTION OF
OUR COUNTRY. THAT IS WHAT IT DID FOR ME.
WHEN I WAS 18, MY PARENTS TOLD
ME TO VOTE AND TO VOTE AS A
DEMOCRAT. THEY WERE DEEPLY COMMITTED TO
THEIR PARTY AND I KNOW THEY EXPECTED ME TO BE THAT WAY. BUT THEY ALSO TOLD ME TO BE AN INDEPENDENT THINKER. IN COLLEGE, I WAS SHOWN BY A FRIEND A ONE-PAGE SUMMARY OF THE
REPUBLICAN PLATFORM. 10 PRINCIPLES THAT DEFINED THE REPUBLICANS. I COMPARED IT LINE BY LINE TO
THE DEMOCRATS. FOR ALL MY FAMILY'S HISTORY,
THERE IS ONE DOCUMENT, ONE PARTY
PLATFORM MADE ME INTO A REPUBLICAN.
[APPLAUSE] I HAVE SEEN HOW THE PROCESS
WORKS. I COMPARED IT TO HER DEMOCRATIC COLLEAGUES. OUR'S WAS OPEN, A BOTTOM-UP
PROCESS WITH PARTICIPATING OF
112 COMMITTED DELEGATES. WE READ COMMENTS AND IDEAS FROM
GOOD REPUBLICANS ONLINE AND
AROUND THE COUNTRY AND THROUGH 11 SESSIONS. WE TELEVISED ALL OF OUR DELIBERATIONS AND THEN WE CAME TOGETHER ON PRINCIPLES BASED ON
STRONG FAMILY VALUES, A STRONG NATIONAL DEFENSE, SUPPORT FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT AND INDIVIDUAL LIBERTY. WE NEVER FORGET THESE ARE WHAT MAKE AMERICANS EXCEPTIONAL. VALUES THAT SOME TAKE FOR GRANTED, WHICH IS SOMETHING WE
REPUBLICANS WILL NEVER DO. THE PROCESS THE DEMOCRATS USE IS NOT ONLY DIFFERENT IN THE WAY
THEY DID IT BACK IN MY PARENTS'
DAY, IN A BACK ROOM WITH 15 INDIVIDUALS HAND-PICKED BY ENTITLED LEADERS AND A SECRETIVE PROCESS. AWAY FROM ALL AMERICAN PEOPLE. THEIR'S IS A SECRETIVE, TOP-DOWN PROCESS AND A RESULT IS
A PLATFORM WHICH REFLECTS A HOUSE DIVIDED WITH NO ATTENTION
TO THIS SERIOUS CONCERNS OF
AMERICANS TODAY. I WANT TO THANK OUR LEADERS,
PARTICULARLY THE 112 MEMBERS OF
OUR PLATFORM COMMITTEE, AND ALL
OF OUR DEDICATED STAFF FOR THEIR
HARD WORK AND COMMITMENT TO UNITY AS WE HEAD INTO THE NOVEMBER ELECTIONS. THE DOCUMENT WE PRODUCED IS ONE
THAT WE AND OUR ELECTED OFFICIALS AND OUR PARTY CAN BE
VERY PROUD OF. GOD BLESS THE COMMITTEE AND
THANK YOU FOR ALL YOUR WORK.
[APPLAUSE] PLEASE WELCOME MY FELLOW COCHAIR
OF THE PLATFORM COMMITTEE,
UNITED STATES REPRESENTATIVE VIRGINIA FOXX OF NORTH CAROLINA.</span><span class='hidden-full-transcript-ellipses'>...</span></p><a href='#' class='hidden-full-transcript-link'><i class='icon-chevron-down'></i> <span class='link-show-full-text'>Show Full Text</span><i class='icon-chevron-up'></i> <span class='link-show-less-text'>Show Less Text</span></a>

<p class='short_transcript'> REP. FOXX: THANK YOU. THANK YOU, GOVERNOR FALLIN. THE SENATOR HAS BEAUTIFULLY LAID OUT THE VISION OUR PLATFORM PROVIDES. THE REAFFIRMATION OF THE PRINCIPLES<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> AMERICA AND THE
REPUBLICAN PARTY WERE FOUNDED
ON. GOVERNOR FALLIN IS A POWERFUL EXAMPLE OF THE IMPACT VISION CAN HAVE ON ONE INDIVIDUAL WHEN SHE SEARCHED FOR A POLITICAL HOME.
IT HAS BEEN AN HONOR TO SERVE WITH THEM.
WE MUST THANK THE 112 DELEGATES SERVING ON THE PLATFORM COMMITTEE AND THE STAFF AND
VOLUNTEERS FOR THEIR COMMITMENT
TO OUR PRINCIPLES AND UNITING TO ARTICULATE THAT REPUBLICAN VISION INTO A FOCUSED DOCUMENT ANY AMERICAN CAN FIND AGREEMENT
WITH. THEIR WORK IS A TREMENDOUS
EXAMPLE OF INDIVIDUALS EXPRESSING THEMSELVES AS WE THE PEOPLE BY EBINGBEING THE PEOPLE.W E MUST ALL LOOK TO THE WE MUST LOOK AT THE PLATFORM AS
ARE CALLED TO BE THE PEOPLE. THAT IS A CHARGE EXTENDED FROM
THE PLATFORM COMMITTEE TO ALL
DELEGATES HERE. ALL THE REPUBLICANS AND ALL AMERICANS.
RONALD REAGAN ONCE SAID IF NOT OF FOOD, IF NOT NOW, WHEN? THOSE WORDS INSPIRED A
GENERATION OF YOUNG AMERICANS
WHO UNDERSTOOD WHAT REAGAN MEANT.
IF WE ARE TO ENJOY THE BLESSINGS
OF LIBERTY, WE'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR SAFEGUARDING OUR FREEDOMS
AND ADVANCING THEM FOR OTHERS. THAT IS WHY WE MUST AGAIN ANSWER
THAT CALL.
WE THE PEOPLE WILL BE THE PEOPLE.
WE WILL BE THE PEOPLE WHO RESTORES CONSTITUTIONAL GOVERNMENT IN OUR REPUBLIC. WE WILL BE THE PEOPLE WHO GET AMERICA GROWING AND WORKING
AGAIN. WE WILL BE THE PEOPLE WHO BRING
AMERICANS TOGETHER TO RESTORE OUR NATION'S SENSE OF MORAL PURPOSE. OF COURSE, WE WILL BE THE PEOPLE
WHO MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN.
[APPLAUSE] IF ANYONE IS WONDERING WHEN, THE ANSWER IS NOW.
[APPLAUSE] OUR PLATFORM IS THE BLUEPRINT TO
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. IN THAT GREATNESS, WE CAN RESTORE AMERICA TO THE MORE PERFECT UNION THAT IS ITS DIVINE CALLING. ALL THAT BEGINS WITH A SIMPLE ACCEPTANCE THAT WE MUST BE THE
PEOPLE. WITH THAT, WE CAN STAY UNITED
AND MOVE FROM THIS PLATFORM, THIS CONVENTION AND HIS CAMPAIGN TO, GOD WILLING, VICTORY IN NOVEMBER. MAY GOD CONTINUE TO BLESS US
ALL.
