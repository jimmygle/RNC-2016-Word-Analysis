<strong>Shelley Moore Capito</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> LET ME START OUT WITH A
QUESTION. ARE THERE ANY MOUNTAIN YEARS IN
THE AUDIENCE TONIGHT? I'M SHELLY, THE FIRST WOMAN EVER
ELECTED TO SERVE THIS DATE<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> OF
WEST VIRGINIA IN UNITED STATES
SENATE. WE FACE CHALLENGING TIMES. TIMES IN WHICH WE AS LEADERS MUST ASK HOW CAN WE SECURE A FUTURE THAT IS BRIGHTER FOR NEXT GENERATION?
THAT'S ALWAYS THE CHALLENGE OF
LEADERSHIP AND THIS ELECTION IS
NO DIFFERENT. WITH TALENT COMES OPPORTUNITY
AND THAT IS WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO'S WEAK TO YOU ABOUT TONIGHT.
LET ME FIRST TELL YOU WHERE I COME FROM, THE MOUNTAIN STATE. I'M A LIFELONG WEST VIRGINIA IN AND WITH OUR TIGHTKNIT
COMMUNITIES, I SAY OUR STATE IS ONE BIG SMALL TOWN.
THAT'S NEVER BEEN MORE EVIDENT
THAN IN THE PAST MONTH AS WEST
VIRGINIA WAS RAVAGED BY FLOODING
THAT UPENDED OUR COMMUNITIES,
DISPLACED OUR FAMILIES, AND
CLAIMED 23 LIVES. AS I TRAVELED THE FLOOD ZONES, I
WAS INSPIRED BY PEOPLE WHO
DESPITE LOSING EVERYTHING SOUGHT
WAYS TO HELP AND SERVE OTHERS. THE STORIES ARE SO TRAGIC YET SO UPLIFTING. AND I AM SO PROUD OF MY STATE. AND THEIR JOBS AND COMMUNITIES,
WEST VIRGINIANS WORK HARD
EVERYDAY AND DELIVER RESULTS AND IN TURN, THEY EXPECT OUR
COUNTRY'S LEADERS TO DO THE
SAME. THE CONSTANT REFRAIN I HEAR BACK
HOME IS STOP THE BICKERING,
IMPROVE THE ECONOMY, AND FIGHT
FOR OUR JOBS. LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING, THEY ARE RIGHT. THE GREATEST OBSTACLE FOR WEST
VIRGINIA FAMILIES AND FAMILIES ACROSS AMERICA OVER THE PAST EIGHT YEARS HAS BEEN A PRESIDENT
THAT PLACES LEFT WING PRIORITIES AND CAMPAIGN PROMISES OVER THEIR
LIVELIHOOD. PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS HURT THE
HEART AND SOUL OF MY STATE, ARE
PRAVACHOL MINORS INTO
COMMUNITIES WHERE THEY LIVE AND WORK AND PURSUE THEIR HAPPINESS. HIS POLICY THAT RIPPED THROUGH
THE HEARTLAND, CREATING A CYCLE
OF PESSIMISM AND DISCUSSED. PEOPLE AROUND THE COUNTRY FEEL
THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION HAS
KICKED THEM TO THE CURB WITH A CALLOUSNESS THAT DAMAGE THEIR ABILITY TO TRUST GOVERNMENT. IN 2008, PRESIDENT OBAMA FAMOUSLY SAID IF SOMEONE WANTS TO BUILD A COAL POWER PLANT, THEY CAN. IT'S JUST THAT IT WILL BANKRUPT
THEM. EIGHT YEARS LATER, IT IS SAFE TO SAY HIS ACTIONS HAVE MATCHED HIS
WORDS. BUT HE NEVER REALIZED WHEN YOU
BANKRUPT THE COAL COMPANY, YOU
PROVIDE -- TO PRIDE COMMUNITIES
OF THEIR -- DEPRIVE COMMUNITIES
OF THEIR LIVELIHOOD. HIS RECKLESSNESS HAS COST MORE THAN 60,000 WORKERS THEIR JOB SINCE 2011. THAT'S 60,000 FAMILIES WITHOUT A WORK, WITHOUT A PAYCHECK. NOT TO BE OUTDONE, HILLARY
CLINTON HAS ALREADY PROMISED TO
PUT A LOT OF COAL MINERS AND COAL COMPANIES OUT OF BUSINESS. SHE WANTS TO PUT THOUSANDS MORE
AMERICANS OUT OF WORK. SHE HAS PROMISED TO DEVASTATE
COMMUNITIES AND FAMILIES ACROSS
COLD COUNTRY. WHEN I THINK ABOUT HILLARY
CLINTON'S PURSUIT OF AN ANTI-COAL AGENDA, YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK ABOUT? ABOUT MINOR THAT WAKES UP BEFORE
DON EVERY DAY TO GO TO A 10 HOUR
SHIFT, THAT BUS DRIVER WHO
DRIVES THE CHILDREN TO SCHOOL, THE NURSE WHO CARES FOR OUR
RETIRED MINERS COME AND THE
HUNDREDS OF COAL EQUIPMENT DISTRIBUTORS. I WEEP FOR THE FABRIC OF MY STATE. I WEEP FOR THE FABRIC OF MY
STATE. THESE MEN AND WOMAN TAKE PRIDE IN THEIR JOBS THAT PROVIDE FOR
THEIR FAMILIES AND SUPPORT THEIR COMMUNITY. THEY WORKED TIRELESSLY TO POWER AMERICA.
WEST VIRGINIA WORKERS ARE THE BACKBONE OF THIS ECONOMY AND
HILLARY CLINTON SOMETHING TO PUT THEM OUT OF WORK. WE SHOULDN'T BE SURPRISED BECAUSE HILLARY IS UNDERSTANDS COAL MINERS IN WHAT FOLLOW
WORKERS AS WELL AS SHE UNDERSTANDS SECURE E-MAIL. A DAY IN THE LIFE OF A COAL
MINER AND THE DAY IN THE LIFE OF
HILLARY CLINTON COULD NOT BE MORE DIFFERENT. FOR OVER 25 YEARS, SHE HAS
THRIVED IN A WORLD WHERE THE RULES BEND TO HER.
RECENTLY, WE LEARNED SHE SHOWED EXTREME CARELESSNESS WITH OUR NATIONS SECRETS. FOR OTHERS, THE CONSEQUENCES OF MISUSING CLASSIFIED INFORMATION HAVE IN SWIFT AND SERIOUS BUT NOT FOR HILLARY CLINTON. SINCE THE END OF HER HUSBAND'S
ADMINISTRATION, SHE HAS PROFITED FROM CLOSED-DOOR SPEECHES WITH
FEES THAT WOULD BUY SEVERAL
HOUSES IN THE STATE OF WEST VIRGINIA.
NOT THE IS SHE OUT OF TOUCH, HER ATTEMPTS TO REACH OUT TO THE
AMERICAN PEOPLE OFTEN REVEAL HOW DISTORTED HER VISION HAS BECOME.
BUT WHAT I FIND MOST TROUBLING IS THAT HILLARY CLINTON FAILS TO RECOGNIZE ALL CAPS RELATED
POLICIES AFFECT REAL PEOPLE. THOSE WHO WANT TO FEED THEIR
FAMILY, OWN HOMES, PAY FOR
COLLEGE, ASSUME THE AMERICAN DREAM. THESE GOALS SHOULD NOT AND CANNOT FALL OUT OF REACH. IT MAY FEEL LIKE PRESIDENT OBAMA
AIR CURRENTLY PROCLAIMED HE
WOULD SLOW THE RISE OF THE OCEANS. HE INTRODUCED AND IMPLEMENTED SWEEPING ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS WITHOUT CONGRESS APPROVAL AND WITHOUT ANY
CONSIDERATION FOR THE ECONOMY. THESE UNILATERAL ACTIONS ARE ILL-INFORMED AND FRANKLY
UNCONSTITUTIONAL. RIGHT NOW, THE BURDEN OF GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS IN THIS COUNTRY AMOUNTS TO $15,000 A HOUSEHOLD. SO LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION.
ARE YOU READY? IS A BURDENING EVERY HOUSEHOLD IN AMERICA WITH THE COST OF
$15,000 WORTH MORE APPLAUSE
LINES AT CAMPAIGN RALLIES? IS BURDENING EVERY HOUSEHOLD IN AMERICA WITH 15,000 DOLLARS
WORTH MORE CAMPAIGN CASH? IS BURDENING EVERY HOUSEHOLD IN AMERICA WITH $15,000 WORTH A FEW
MORE ONE-LINERS? I COULDN'T AGREE WITH YOU MORE
AND I'M SURE YOU AGREE WITH ME
ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS
ELECTION.
[APPLAUSE] ONE OF THE REASONS THIS ELECTION IS SO IMPORTANT IS BECAUSE THE
DEMOCRATS HAVE NOMINATED A CANDIDATE THAT AMERICANS OVERWHELMINGLY DISTRESSED -- DAVISISTRUST. HER TURN AT THE STATE DEPARTMENT
WAS SHROUDED IN SCANDAL. A FEW WEEKS AGO, THE FBI DIRECTOR SAID SECRETARY CLINTON
WAS NEGLIGENT, QUESTIONED HER
JUDGMENT, AND REVEALED COUNTLESS
WAYS SHE HAS MISLED THE AMERICAN
PEOPLE. WE KNOW THAT THE CORNERSTONE OF
OUR GLOBAL LEADERSHIP IS NOT JUST OUR AWESOME MILITARY, NOT
JUST OUR ECONOMIC POWER, BUT OUR CREDIBILITY. SHE HAS SQUANDERED AMERICAN'S TRUST AND THANKFULLY, THE LATEST HASN'T SLIPPED PAST THE
ATTENTION OF THE AMERICAN
PEOPLE. RECENT POLLS SHOW VOTERS
DISTRUST OF HILLARY WAS
DETERIORATING HER SUPPORT. SO IT DOES COME DOWN TO TRUST. SHE CANNOT BE TRUSTED WITH CLASSIFIED INFORMATION OR TRUSTED TO PLAY BY THE SAME
RULES THAT YOU AND I PLAY BY AND WITHOUT TRUST, WE CANNOT FEEL
SAFE AND WE CANNOT THRIVE. NO ONE WHO HAS LOST THE TRUST OF
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE SHOULD EVER
SERVE AS OUR PRESIDENT.
[APPLAUSE] SEN. CAPITO: THE ONLY THING WE
CAN TRUST HILLARY TO DO IS TO
DOUBLE DOWN ON THE SAME FAILED OBAMA POLICIES THAT ARE HURTING AMERICANS THAT I JUST DESCRIBED. WE KNOW SHE WILL DOUBLE DOWN ON
AN ECONOMIC AGENDA THAT HAS MADE
THE LOWEST WORKFORCE
PARTICIPATION IN DECADES.
WE KNOW THAT SHE WILL DOUBLE
DOWN ON THE WAR ON COAL. WE KNOW THAT SHE WILL DOUBLE DOWN ON OBAMACARE. WE KNOW THAT SHE WILL DOUBLE DOWN ON FAR LESS SUPREME COURT NOMINEES.
[BOOING] SEN. CAPITO: WE KNOW THAT SHE
WILL DOUBLE DOWN ON THE
CATASTROPHIC FOREIGN POLICY THAT
SHE HERSELF HAS ORCHESTRATED.
[BOOING] SEN. CAPITO: THE CONTRAST BETWEEN OUR VISION FOR THE
FUTURE AND THAT OF HILLARY CLINTON IS CLEAR.
NOW IS THE TIME TO TURN THE TIDE
. ARE YOU WITH ME? LET US TURN THE TIDE. SO THAT UNELECTED BUREAUCRATS NO LONGER MANDATE REGULATIONS THAT
ARE DISCONNECTED FROM THE
REALITIES OF WORKING AMERICANS. LET US TURN THE TIDE FROM AN EXECUTIVE WHO PROMOTES RADICAL ENVIRONMENTAL AGENDA THAT RAISES COSTS ACROSS THIS COUNTRY. LET US TURN THE TIDE FROM A WASHINGTON THAT TELLS US WHO ARE DOCTORS ARE AND DELIVERS A LOWER QUALITY OF CARE. LET US TURN THE TIDE TO A GOVERNMENT THAT RESPECTS THE CONSTITUTION AND TAX JOBS -- PROTECTS JOBS AND THE WAY OF
LIFE IN RURAL AMERICA. THIS IS NOT OUT OF REACH. WE CAN MAKE THESE VISIONS A
REALITY. THIS WEEK, WE WILL OFFICIALLY
NOMINATE A CANDIDATE WHO
RECEIVED THE MOST PRIMARY VOTES
IN THE HISTORY OF OUR PARTY.
A CANDIDATE WHO UNDERSTANDS HOW
TO CREATE JOBS AND GROW THE
ECONOMY. OUR PARTY WANTS TO ALLOW
BUSINESSES TO CREATE JOBS, NOT REGULATE JOBS OUT OF EXISTENCE. OUR PARTY UNDERSTANDS THE FREE
MARKET AND DOES NOT TRY TO
CONTROL IT. OUR PARTY STANDS UP FOR
HARD-WORKING AMERICANS MIGHT MY
HARD-WORKING WEST VIRGINIA COAL
MINERS.
[CHEERING] SEN. CAPITO: OUR PARTY WILL
STRENGTHEN OUR MILITARY TO FACE
GROWING THREATS. WE MUST CARRY THIS MOMENTUM TO
ELECT DONALD TRUMP, WHO SPEAKS
DIRECTLY TO AMERICANS WHO HAVE BEEN DEVASTATED BY THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION.
WEST VIRGINIANS KNOW HE
UNDERSTANDS THEIR PROBLEMS.
SHARES THEIR CONCERNS.
BY GOLLY, HE IS GOING TO DO
THINGS MUCH DIFFERENTLY. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE KNOW THAT
HILLARY CLINTON HAS FORFEITED HER TRUST AND HAS BROKEN HER
BOND WITH WORKING AMERICANS. SO, LET US COMMIT TONIGHT TO
BRINGING OUR COUNTRY TOGETHER IN
THE MONTHS AHEAD.
MISTAKES ARE BOTH CLEAR AND
HIGH.
TAKE THIS ENERGY FROM THIS -- THE STAKES ARE BOTH CLEAR AND
HIGH. TAKE THIS ENERGY TO ELECT DONALD TRUMP, WHO WILL MAKE AMERICA
RATE AGAIN.
THANK YOU.
[CHEERING]
