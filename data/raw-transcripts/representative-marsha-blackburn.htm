<strong>Unidentified Speaker</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> HELLO THERE, TENNESSEE.
[CHEERING] AND HELLO TO EVERYONE HERE TONIGHT AND DO ALL OF YOU WHO ARE WATCHING US AT HOME, ON IPHONES AND ON TWITTER. WELCOME.
[CHEERING]<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> I HAVE A QUESTION FOR YOU, DO YOU, DO YOU WANT TO HELP MAKE AMERICA ONE AGAIN?
[CHEERING] LET ME HEAR YOU!
[CHEERING] ALL RIGHT. WE HAVE ALL HAD ENOUGH OF
BLOATED BUDGETS, UNKEPT PROMISES
AND POINTLESS REDLINES. WE'VE HAD ENOUGH DIVISION AND
ENOUGH HE DID RHETORIC THAT SERVES TO ONLY DRIVE A WEDGE BETWEEN US AND OUR NEIGHBOR. ANOTHER SCENE OUR 401(K)S, OUR BILLS GET BIGGER IN OUR TAXES GO UP AND OUR PAYCHECK SHRINKS. IN SHORT, THE AMERICAN PEOPLE
HAVE HAD IT.
[CHEERING] AND THEY ARE READY FOR CHANGE. READY FOR SOMEONE TO TAKE THE REINS AND BRING US TOGETHER.
[CHEERING] THERE IS SOMEONE THAT CAN GET
THE JOB DONE FOR US LARRY THE
CABLE GUY WOULD SAY, LET'S GIT
'R'DONE. THERE IS SOMEONE WHO CAN COME IN AHEAD OF SCHEDULE AND UNDER BUDGET WHO HAS SEEN THE BOTTOM LINE AND NEGOTIATED THE COST AND DEALT SOMETHING TO LAST. A LEADER WHO KNOWS THAT THIS COUNTRY IS NOT FULL OF -- OUR WHO KNOWS THAT THIS
NATION IS FULL OF CITIZENS WHO
WANT A LEADER WHO KNOWS THE SURE ROUTE TO PROSPERITY, WHO INSPIRES, WHO KNOWS THAT
LEADERSHIP IS A HARD FOUGHT FOR
AND NOT A SUBJECT LINE IN AN
E-MAIL. THAT IS WHY ASKING ALL OF YOU TO JOIN ME TONIGHT AND ELECTING DONALD TRUMP AS PRESIDENT OF THE
UNITED STATES.
[CHEERING] DONALD TRUMP HAS THE SKILLS REQUIRED TO LEAD THIS NATION, A DIVERSE NATION AND HE CAN HELP OUR PEOPLE ACHIEVE GREATNESS. HE BELIEVES IN THE AMERICAN DREAM BECAUSE HE HAS LIVED THE
AMERICAN DREAM. THE DESIRE FOR GREATNESS IS NOT
NEW. PRESIDENT LINCOLN STOOD RIGHT
HERE IN THIS VERY CITY 155 YEARS AGO WITH A CALL FOR US TO BIND TOGETHER OR PARISH APART.
LISTEN TO HIS WORDS. IF ALL DO NOT JOIN NOW TO SAVE
THE GOOD SHIP OF THE UNION, NOBODY WILL HAVE A CHANCE TO
PILOT HER ON ANOTHER.
[CHEERING] AND AGAIN WE FIND OUR NATION IN
DESPERATE NEED OF TRUE LEADERSHIP, DESPERATE NEED OF
UNITY, THE LAST EIGHT YEARS HAVE
BEEN A CHALLENGE. TO OUR NATIONAL AND HOUSEHOLD BUDGET, TO OUR CONSTITUTION AND
TO THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO GIVE THEIR LIVES AND THEIR SACRED HONOR TO PROTECT THE
CONSTITUTION AND PROTECT US. WE KNOW THAT DONALD TRUMP IS A LEADER WHO ARE SEEING
CHALLENGES, HE HAS SOLVED PROBLEMS AND DELIVERED RESULTS. SOME OF OUR NATION'S GREATEST
LEADERS HAVE BEEN PEOPLE WHO
HAVE WORKED IN THE REAL WORLD
WHO KNOW FIRSTHAND HOW CUMBERSOME RULES AND UNNECESSARY REGULATION GET IN THE WAY OF
GREATNESS. I WANT A PRESIDENT WHO KNOWS THAT LEADERSHIP IS NOT AS IT APPEARS BUT AS IT PERFORMS. WHO HAS SEEN SOMETHING THROUGH FROM BEGINNING TO COMPLETION,
WHO LOOKS AT THE MUNDANE AND SEES MAGNIFICENCE. AFTER ALL, THAT IS THE MAGIC OF THIS COUNTRY. EVERY DAY PEOPLE WITH BIG IDEAS
AND THEY DREAMS AND THEY TRY TO
COMPLETE THEM, NOT ONLY CAN THEY
CHANGE OUR SKYLINE, THEY CAN CHANGE THE WORLD.
[CHEERING] LEADERSHIP IS NOT ABOUT LINES ON A RESUME, GENDER, RACE, ZIP CODE, PEDIGREE, LINEAGE, HARD
FEELINGS ARE NOT QUALIFIED FOR
LEADERSHIP. LEADERSHIP IS A RECORD OF
PERFORMANCE AND ACCOMPLISHMENT. AND TEAMBUILDING. THAT IS LEADERSHIP YOU CAN
TRUST.
[CHEERING] WE AMERICANS ARE BOUND TOGETHER
BY THE SHARED DESIRE FOR FAITH, FAMILY, FREEDOM, HOPE, AND
OPPORTUNITY. WE WANT A PRESIDENT WHO BELIEVES THAT YOU, NOT WASHINGTON,. WHO BELIEVES THAT YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO PRESERVE YOUR VERSION
OF THE AMERICAN DREAM.
[CHEERING] I KNOW YOU BELIEVE, I DO TOO,
THAT AMERICA IS ON THE EDGE OF
GREAT AND MIGHTY THINGS. WE NEED A PRESIDENT WHO UNDERSTANDS THIS AND UNDERSTAND
THIS IS ABOUT FREEDOM AND FREEDOM'S CAUSES AND UNITE US,
NOT DIVIDE US.
[CHEERING] LET ME ASK YOU ANOTHER QUESTION,
ARE YOU WITH ME?
[CHEERING] ARE YOU WITH TRUMP-PENCE 2016?
[CHEERING] TOGETHER WE CAN GET THE COUNTRY BUILDING, WORKING, JOBS COME BACK, OUR COMMUNITY GROWS AND IT
SEEMED LEADERS ACTUALLY LEAD AND TOGETHER, WITH YOU AND WITH TRUMP-PENCE 2016, WE WILL BE GREAT AGAIN, WE WILL BE ONE AGAIN. THANK YOU.
[CHEERING] GOD BLESS!
