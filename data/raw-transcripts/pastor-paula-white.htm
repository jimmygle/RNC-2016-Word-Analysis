<p class='short_transcript'> >> I WILL ASK YOU TO RISE UP AND
PRAY. AT THAT BEFORE COME OUR NATION
NEEDS PRAYER.
TO GOD, WE NEED YOU.
WE STAND TONIGHT CHALLENGING TIMES. I'M REMINDED<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> OF YOUR WORDS IN ISAIAH CHAPTER 59, OUR KURT -- CORK OPPOSE THE RIGHTEOUS AND
JUSTICE IS NO TO BE FOUND.
TRUTH STUMBLES IN THE STREET AND
HONESTY HAS BEEN OUTLAWED. YES TRUTH IS GONE, AND ANYONE
WHO RENOUNCES EVIL IS ATTACKED, WE TOO HAVE OFTEN TURNED OUR BACK ON TRUTH. AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS
CONVENTION, AT THIS VERY CRITICAL MOMENT, AND AMERICA'S
HISTORY, WE CHOOSE A DIFFERENT PATH.
WE PRAY THAT YOU WOULD FORGIVE
US FOR OUR UNRIGHTEOUSNESS. THAT YOU WOULD INSPIRE US TO DO
WHAT IS RIGHT.
THAT YOU WOULD EMPOWER US TO BE BRAVE, THAT HE WOULD GIVE US A
THAT BELIEVES THAT THINGS CAN
AND WILL CHANGE. HELP US OF GOD TO FIGHT WITH ALL OF OUR MIGHT FOR THE FUTURE OF
OUR COUNTRY. FOR THE FREEDOM OF OUR CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN. FOR THE PEACE THAT IS BROUGHT BY
OUR ROLE OF LAW. YOUR DEFINITION OF JUSTICE.
HELP US PRAY NOT ONLY IN THE SYMBOLIC MOMENTS, BUT IN EVERY MOMENT.
HELP US TO PRAY LIKE WE MADE IT. AND HELP US TO PRAY LIKE IT
MATTERS. PROTECT US FROM ALL THOSE WHO
AIM TO DESTROY US.
AND MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN. GIVE US EYES TO SEE A BRIGHTER FUTURE FOR AMERICA.
WE BELIEVE IN FAITH, BUT IT IS
TIME FOR TARGET TO BE DISPELLED. IT IS TIME FOR THIS NATION TO
LIVE OUT ITS HOLY CALLING IN THE WORLD AND IT IS TIME FOR US TO
BRIDGE THE DIVIDE AND BECOME ONE AGAIN.
WE BELIEVE IN FAITH, TIME FOR
REST BECOME THE LIGHT OF THIS WORLD THAT IT SO DESPERATELY
NEEDS. IT IS TIME FOR US IN THIS NATION
TO UPHOLD TRUTH, PROUDLY AND
BOLDLY. WE CHOOSE BY FAITH TO STAND FOR
THE WAY OF OUR GOD, TO WALK IN
LOVE, TO SEEK PEACE FOR THE
GENERATIONS TO COME IN WHICH IS BY FAITH TO RAISE UP A STANDARD AGAINST THE FORCES OF EVIL. TO HAVE A HEART FOR YOUR PRESENT, TO HAVE A THIRST FOR
RIGHTEOUSNESS, DEAR GOD, WE
CONFESS THAT WE NEED YOU AS
NEVER BEFORE. WE NEED YOUR GUIDANCE, WE NEED YOUR BLESSING, WE NEED YOUR HELP, WE NEED YOUR ANOINTING, WE
REMEMBER THE MANY TROUBLED WATERS THAT YOU BROUGHT US
THROUGH BY YOUR GRACE AND YOUR
MERCY, WE REMEMBER THE RED SEA
THAT HAD IMPARTED IN THE MOUTH
OF THE LINES THAT HAVE BEEN
PACIFIED. WE REMEMBER THE MIRACLES OF THOSE TIMES AND OUR TIME, WE
REMEMBER THE MIRACLE OF AMERICA. WE FIND OUR HOPE THAT WE CAN BE GREAT AND WE CAN BE GOOD AS WE STAND IN YOUR RIGHTEOUSNESS AND
LORD, AS WE LEAVE, LEAD US SO THAT FUTURE GENERATIONS IN THIS LAND KNOW YOUR GOODNESS.
YOU BLESS US AND KEEP US, MAKE
YOUR FAITH SHINE UPON US. MAY YOU SHOW US YOUR FAVOR AND
GIVE US YOUR PIECE IN THE NAME
OF JESUS CHRIST WHO GETS US THE
HOPE FOR US AT THE TOMB AND HIS
LIFE HAS BROUGHT US YOUR LIFE.
AND ALL THE HOPE IN THE WORLD. AMEN. AMEN. GOD BLESS AMERICA!
