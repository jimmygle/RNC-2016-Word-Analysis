<p class='short_transcript'> >> THANK YOU AND WELCOME TO THE 2016 REPUBLICAN NATIONAL CONVENTION.
TAKE A MOMENT TO LOOK AROUND. LIKE THE TEAM THAT WON A
NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP, THE<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> CLEVELAND CAVALIERS, OUR NOMINEE WILL WIN THIS NOVEMBER. FIRST OF ALL I WANT TO THANK THE ACTIVISTS.
YOU'RE THE CORE OF OUR DEMOCRACY. YOU GAVE MANY TALKS AND ATTENDED MANY MEETINGS IN ORDER TO GET ELECTED IN YOUR TOWNSHIP,
DISTRICT, AND STATE. NOW HERE YOU ARE IN CLEVELAND TO

UNITED STATES. CONVENTIONS HAVE PLAYED A VITAL ROLE TO DEBATE THE RULES AND THE
POLICIES. A SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITY TO
PRESENT THE CANDIDATES TO YOUR
VISION. MY COLLEAGUES AND I ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR PROVIDING A
PLATFORM FOR YOU TO WORK AND ENJOY YOURSELVES. WE HAVE ADDED FREEDOM PLAZA.
FOR YOU TO ENJOY SOME TIME WITH
DELEGATES AND GUESTS. WE ENCOURAGE YOU TO VISIT MANY
OF THE VENDORS WE HAVE. AND THEN WE WANT YOU TO ENJOY
YOURSELVES IN HERE. I HOPE YOU WILL FIND WE HAVE SUCCEEDED IN MAKING THIS A TREMENDOUS EXPERIENCE FOR YOU. I WOULD LIKE TO THANK YOU FOR
GIVING US THE OPPORTUNITY TO
SERVE IN THIS ROLE. WE BOTH BENEFITED FROM WORKING
WITH HARD-WORKING AND DEVOTED
STAFF. I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO THANK MAYOR FRANK JACKSON AND DAVID GILBERT
AND THE WHOLE HOST COMMUNITY. THEY HAVE BEEN GRACIOUS HOSTS AS
YOU SEE HERE IN CLEVELAND. I WOULD LIKE TO THANK MY WIFE DOREEN AND OUR BOYS ERIC AND
