<strong>Tony Perkins</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, YOU MAY
BE SEATED. I'M HERE SPEAKING TONIGHT IN MY PERSONAL CAPACITY, NOT ON BEHALF OF ANY OF THE NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS THAT<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> I LEAD. WE HAVE GATHERED HERE IN
CLEVELAND TO SELECT THE
REPUBLICAN NOMINEE FOR PRESIDENT
AND WE HAVE ACCOMPLISHED THAT
MISSION. DONALD TRUMP IS THE NOMINEE OF
THE REPUBLICAN PARTY.
[CHEERING] AND I WILL BE VOTING FOR DONALD TRUMP IN  NOVEMBER AND I WILL URGE MY FELLOW AMERICANS TO DO
THE SAME.
[CHEERING] ALLOW ME TO EXPLAIN WHY. TONIGHT WE FOCUS ON MAKING
AMERICA ONE AGAIN. IN THE PLEDGE THAT WE JUST RECITED, WE SAID WE ARE ONE NATION UNDER GOD. CONGRESS ADDED THE WORDS UNDER
GOD TO THE PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE IN 1954. THE CONTEXT IN WHICH THOSE WORDS WERE ADDED AS INSTRUCTED, THE
COLD WAR HAS BEGUN, AS A NATION
WE FACE AN EXISTENTIAL THREAT,
YOU MIGHT REMEMBER CHILDREN
PRACTICE THE ART OF DR. AND
COVER IN CLASSROOMS ACROSS THE COUNTRY FEARING NUCLEAR ATTACKS.
THE THREAT TO OUR NATION'S SURVIVAL WAS REAL.
IT WAS JUST AS REAL THAN AS IT
IS TODAY. THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT PRESIDENT EISENHOWER KNEW WHERE TO PLACE AMERICA'S TRUST AND UPON HEARING A SERMON BY REVEREND GEORGE DOCKERY, PRESIDENT EISENHOWER PROMPTED CONGRESS TO ADOPT THE
WORDS UNDER GOD. REVEREND DR. JIHAD POINTED TO
THE WORDS OF THE FIRST -- REVEREND DOCKERY POINTED TO THE
WORDS OF THE FIRST GROUP, LINCOLN SAID UNDER GOD PEOPLE SHALL KNOW A NEW BIRTH OF
FREEDOM. A LOT HAS CHANGED SINCE THEN. BUT THE SOURCE OF AMERICA'S HOPE
AND FUTURE HAS NOT. IT IS FOUND IN THE SAME PLACE
TODAY AS IT WAS IN 1863 AND
1954, UNDER GOD.
[CHEERING] BUT MY FRIENDS ARE -- FREEDOMS
THAT APPEAL TO UNITE UNDER GOD
HAS BEEN UNDER STUDY ASSAULT. THIS IS WHY WE MUST STOP THOSE
IN OUR GOVERNMENT AND OUR COURTS
TO HAVE EITHER IN PRINCIPLE OR PRACTICE ATTEMPTED TO REMOVE
THESE TWO WORDS UNDER GOD AND
ALL THAT THEY MEAN FROM PUBLIC
LIFE HERE IN AMERICA.
[APPLAUSE] FROM HIS JUDICIAL NOMINEES TO
HIS RUNNING MATE, TO THE PARTY PLATFORM AND THE POLICIES IT
PROMOTES, DONALD TRUMP HAS COMMITTED TO UPHOLDING AND PROTECTING THE FIRST FREEDOM AND
THEREFORE OUR ABILITY --
[CHEERING] AND THEREFORE OUR ABILITY AS CITIZENS TO UNITE OUR NATION ONCE AGAIN UNDER GOD. LET US GO FORTH FROM HERE AND DO
THAT WORK. THANK YOU AND GOD BLESS YOU.
