<strong>Eric Holcomb</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> MR. CHAIRMAN, DELEGATES AND  
GUEST OF THE 2016 REPUBLICAN  
NATIONAL CONVENTION, TONIGHT, I 
HAVE THE HIGH HONOR OF PLAYING INTO NOMINATION THE NAME<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> OF A 
MAN I HAVE KNOWN FOR DECADES, 
AND A MAN AMERICA IS JUST 
GETTING TO KNOW. I ALREADY KNOW HIS HEAD.
I ALREADY KNOW WHERE HIS HEART IS. IN INDIANA, SOME KNOW MIKE PENCE AS CONGRESSMAN. OTHERS KNOW HIM AS GOVERNOR.
BUT BACK HOME MOST CALL HIM MIKE. 
AS YOU JUST HEARD, I SERVE AS MIKE'S LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR. HE AND KAREN ARE TWO OF MY  
DEAREST FRIENDS.
TOGETHER WE STOOD SIDE BY SIDE AS OUR STATE HAS SHOWN THE WORLD
HOW COMMON SENSE, CONSERVATIVE LEADERSHIP CAN BALANCE BUDGETS WHILE AT THE SAME TIME CUTTING TAXES EVERY SINGLE YEAR HE'S  
BEEN IN OFFICE. AND WHILE AT THE SAME TIME MAKING RECORD INVESTMENTING IN  
EDUCATION AND INCREASING OUR CHILDREN'S TEST SCORES. IN INDIANA, UNDER MIKE PENCE, 
MORE HOOSIERS ARE WORKING NOW THAN IN ANY TIME IN OUR 200-YEAR HISTORY. AND OUR TEXT SECTOR IS EXPERIENCING EXPLOSIVE RECORD 
GROWTH. IN INDIANA, MIKE PENCE DOESN'T  
JUST CUT RED TAPE, HE ELIMINATES
IT. 
AND THAT IS ONE REASON -- ONE 
REASON WHY INDIANA IS RECOGNIZED
AS HAVING THE BEST BUSINESS CLIMATE IN THE MIDWEST AND THE  
FIFTH BEST BUSINESS CLIMATE IN AMERICA.
IT IS EXACTLY THAT TYPE OF LEADERSHIP OUR COUNTRY IS 
LACKING AND EXACTLY THE TYPE OF LEADERSHIP AMERICANS WILL SEND  
TO THE WHITE HOUSE THIS FALL WITH DONALD TRUMP AND MIKE PENCE.
THESE TWO LEADERS ARE NOT JUST  
PREPARED TO WIN.
THEY ARE PREPARED TO GOVERN. MIKE LIKES TO SAY THAT INDIANA  
IS A STATE THAT WORKS.
AND TONIGHT AMERICA IS CALLING  
ON HIM TO EXPAND THAT SUCCESS TO MAKE AMERICA WORK AGAIN. MR. CHAIRMAN -- MR. CHAIRMAN, ON BEHALF OF THE GREAT STATE OF  
INDIANA, I PROUDLY NOMINATE A GREAT MAN OF INTEGRITY, A PROVEN
CONSERVATIVE, AN INCREDIBLE HUSBAND AND FATHER, AND ONE OF  
MY BEST FRIENDS, I NOMINATE THE 
GREAT GOVERNOR OF INDIANA, MIKE 
PENCE AS THE REPUBLICAN PARTY'S 2016 CANDIDATE FOR VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES  
OF AMERICA! 
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU.
