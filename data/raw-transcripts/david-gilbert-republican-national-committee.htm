<strong>David Gilbert</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> WELCOME TO CLEVELAND, ON
BEHALF OF THE COMMITTEE CHAIRS, WE ARE THRILLED TO MAKE
CLEVELAND YOUR HOME AS YOU
COMMIT TO THE IMPORTANT BUSINESS
THAT BEGINS<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> THIS AFTERNOON. WHAT YOU DO HEAR SHAPES THE
FUTURE OF OUR COUNTRY AND WE ARE
GLAD YOU CHOSE CLEVELAND IS THE
PLACE TO DO IT. PEEK BEHIND THE BANNERS AND YOU
WILL SEE BILLIONS AND NEW PUBLIC AND PRIVATE INVESTMENT THAT IS
HAVING A RESIN ASSAULTS --
HAVING A RENAISSANCE. OFFICE BUILDINGS, PARKS, AND
CULTURAL INSTITUTIONS. ACROSS THE REGION YOU WILL FIND GROWING NEIGHBORHOODS, A
POPULATION GETTING YOUNGER,
SMARTER AND MORE ENGAGED, AND A BUSINESS COMMUNITY PUTTING CAPITAL AND PEOPLE TO WORK. CLEVELAND HAS BECOME A
DESTINATION FOR TOURISTS AND BUSINESSES AND INCREASINGLY FOR
WORLD-CLASS CONVENTION SUCH AS
THIS ONE. WE ARE A CITY WHOSE PEOPLE LOVE
WHO THEY LIVE -- PEOPLE LOVE
WHERE THEY LIVE. WE SAW THAT LAST MONTH WHEN ONE
MILLION PEOPLE GATHERED AND CELEBRATED THE CAVALIERS
NATIONAL NBA TITLE VICTORY, THE
LARGEST CROWD EVER IN CLEVELAND HISTORY. THE FULFILLMENT OF AN INCREDIBLE
EFFORT TO BRING ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT AND COMPLEX EVENTS
ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD HERE TO CLEVELAND, NOTHING MAKES ME
PROUDER TO SEE THIS GREAT
AMERICAN CITY SHINE. THIS IS A FULFILLMENT OF A
COLLABORATION OF OUR PUBLIC AND
PRIVATE SECTORS. I WOULD LIKE TO THANK MAYOR FRANK JACKSON AND COUNTY EXECUTIVE -- AND JOHN KASICH FOR
THEIR LEADERSHIP. I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE REPUBLICAN NATIONAL COMMITTEE
FOR HAVING THE CONFIDENCE ENOUGH TO SERVE AS YOUR HOST.
WITHOUT THIS WE COULDN'T HAVE ACHIEVED THIS IMPORTANT
MILESTONE IN OUR HISTORY AND
YOURS. HAVE A WONDERFUL TIME. WE THE PEOPLE WELCOME YOU AND
WISH YOU A GREAT AND SUCCESSFUL
WEEK. THANK YOU.</span><span class='hidden-full-transcript-ellipses'>...</span></p><a href='#' class='hidden-full-transcript-link'><i class='icon-chevron-down'></i> <span class='link-show-full-text'>Show Full Text</span><i class='icon-chevron-up'></i> <span class='link-show-less-text'>Show Less Text</span></a>
