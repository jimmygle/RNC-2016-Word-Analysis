<strong>Paul D. Ryan</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> MR. RYAN: HEY, EVERYBODY. HEY, WISCONSIN. HELLO, EVERYONE. IT IS AN HONOR TO BE HERE. BEFORE WE BEGIN, I WOULD LIKE TO
REMIND THE DELEGATES OF THE
PROVISIONS<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> OF THE RULES WHICH
REQUIRE EACH CANDIDATE FOR NOMINATION FOR PRESIDENT OF THE
UNITED STATES DEMONSTRATES SUFFICIENT SUPPORT PRIOR TO THE PRESENTATION OF THE NAME OF THE
CANDIDATES FOR NOMINATION.
THE CHAIR WISHES TO INFORM
DELEGATES AT THIS TIME IT HAS BEEN FURNISHED IN A TIMELY MANNER WITH EVIDENCE OF
SUFFICIENT SUPPORT FOR THE
CANDIDATES WHO WILL BE PRESENTED FOR PRESIDENT AND VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES IN
COMPLIANCE WITH THE RULES OF THE
CONVENTION.
[APPLAUSE] ALSO, AS PRESCRIBED UNDER THE RULES, BUT TOTAL TIME FOR NOMINATING SPEECHES FOR ANY
CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT OR VICE
PRESIDENT SHALL NOT EXCEED 15
MINUTES. IT IS ALSO BEEN CUSTOM AT PAST CONVENTIONS FOR THE CHAIR TO RECOGNIZE NON-DELEGATES FOR THE
PURPOSE OF MAKING NOMINATING
SPEECHES AND SECONDING SPEECHES. WITHOUT OBJECTION, THE READING
OF THE ROLLCALL FOR STATES PRESENTING THE NAMES FOR CANDIDATES FOR NOMINATION AND NON-DELEGATES WILL BE PERMITTED TO MAKE NOMINATING AND SECONDING SPEECHES. THE CHAIR NOW RECOGNIZES THE
SENATOR FROM ALABAMA, JEFF SESSIONS, FOR THE PURPOSE OF NOMINATING. PLEASE GIVE HIM A WARM WELCOME.
