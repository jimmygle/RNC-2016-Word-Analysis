<strong>Karen Vaughn</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> KAREN: THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE
OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE TONIGHT.
IT IS A GREAT HONOR. I AM HERE BECAUSE I REMEMBER WHEN AMERICA WAS STRONG AND
PROUD.<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> WHEN OUR WORD MEANT SOMETHING. I AM HERE BECAUSE I RAISED A SON
WHO BELIEVED IN THIS COUNTRY ENOUGH TO GIVE HIS LIFE FOR IT. I AM HERE BECAUSE WE ARE AT A CROSSROADS OF LIKE ANYTHING WE HAVE EVER WITNESSED IN OUR LIFETIME AND SOMETHING MUST
CHANGE NOW.
[APPLAUSE] WE NEED NEW LEADERSHIP, STRONG
LEADERSHIP. LEADERSHIP THAT WILL LONGER SIT IDLY BY AND LET OUR ENEMIES
DEFINE THE WORLD IN WHICH WE
LIVE. THERE IS NO ADVERSARY THE U.S. MILITARY CANNOT DEFEAT IF WE CAN FIND THEM UNDER THE LUDICROUS RULES OF ENGAGEMENT THEY'VE BEEN
FORCED TO FIGHT UNDER FOR THE
LAST SEVEN YEARS.
[APPLAUSE] THANK YOU. OUR NATIONAL LEADERS DESIRE TO WIN HEARTS AND MINDS AT WHATEVER COST TO OUR OWN. TOO MANY AMERICAN SONS AND
DAUGHTERS HAVE DIED NEEDLESS DEATHS DUE TO THESE ABSURD
RULES. INCLUDING MY ONLY SON, ARA AARON. AND THE 29 OTHER BRAVE WARRIORS.
COUNTLESS OTHERS HAVE CURTAILED
THEIR MILITARY CAREERS BECAUSE
OF THE CULTURE THEY KNOW PUTS
THEIR LIVES IN NEEDLESS RISK. HE SAID, I DID NOT JOIN TO BE
SACRIFICED. I JOINED TO FIGHT.
[APPLAUSE] WE HAVE LOST THE WILL TO DEFEND OURSELVES AGAINST ENEMIES WHO
ARE HELL-BENT ON DESTROYING US. WE HAVE BEEN UNWILLING TO LEAD WITH STRENGTH. WE HAVE BEEN UNWILLING TO EVEN CALL OUR ENEMIES BY NAME. HOW CAN YOU DEFEAT AN ENEMY YOU
CANNOT EVEN NAME.
[APPLAUSE] WE MUST ELECT TO LEADERS WILL
GIVE OUR SOLDIERS EVERY TOOL
POSSIBLE TO WIN. LEADERS WE CAN TRUST TO STAND
STRONG AGAINST OUR ENEMIES. LEADERS LIKE DONALD TRUMP.
[APPLAUSE] IT IS WAY PAST TIME TO MAKE
AMERICA STRONG AND SAFE AGAIN. THANK YOU AND GOD BLESS THIS
AMAZING UNITED STATES OF
AMERICA.
[APPLAUSE]
