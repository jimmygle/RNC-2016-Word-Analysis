<strong>Kerry Woolard</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> GOOD EVENING.
IT'S SUCH AN HONOR TO BE HERE TO
SPEAK TO YOU ABOUT OUR NEXT
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES. DONALD TRUMP IS A MAN OF VISION.
HE ISN'T<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> A WIDE-EYED DREAMER BUT SOMEONE WHO SEES THINGS OTHERS DON'T AND TURNS THAT VISION INTO REALITY, MAKING LIFE BETTER FOR PEOPLE AND COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE NATION.
I HAVE EXPERIENCED THIS FIRSTHAND AT THE TRUMP WINERY AND HOTEL. WHEN DONALD TRUMP PURCHASED THE WINERY IN 2011, IT WAS IN RECEIVERSHIP. HE WENT TO WORK BUILDING THE HOTEL, REPLANTING THE VINES, AND
MAKING IT A WORLD-CLASS DESTINATION AND THE LARGEST
VINEYARD IN VIRGINIA.
[APPLAUSE] TODAY, WE EMPLOY MORE THAN 100 PEOPLE AND SUPPORT COUNTLESS OTHER ENTREPRENEURS, CONTRACTORS, SUPPLIERS IN THE REGION. WE GENERATE MILLIONS IN REVENUE AND TAXES WITH A $50 MILLION ECONOMIC IMPACT THAT FURTHER SUSTAINS AND STRENGTHENS THE
COMMUNITY IN WHICH OUR EMPLOYEES AND I WAS -- LIVE. NEARLY 100% SALES GROWTH IN JUST
FIVE YEARS. I HAVEN'T JUST SEEN THIS HAPPEN, I'VE HELPED MAKE IT HAPPEN AND I
CAN TELL YOU, IT WOULD NOT HAVE
HAPPENED WITHOUT DONALD TRUMP AND HIS FAMILY.
[APPLAUSE] LET ME BE CLEAR -- THIS WAS NOT
EASY AND IT WAS NOT INEVITABLE. IT TOOK A TEAM OF HARD-WORKING, DEDICATED EMPLOYEES, BUT IT
TAKES MORE THAN HARD WORK ALONE. OUR SUCCESS WOULD NOT HAVE COME WITHOUT THE LEADERSHIP AND THE
VISION OF THE TRUMPS. WHAT YOU DON'T SEE IS WHEN DONALD TRUMP LISTENS. HE AND HIS SON LISTEN
ATTENTIVELY AND ASK QUESTIONS
THAT LEAD TO ENGAGED DECISIONS BASED ON THE EXPERT KNOWLEDGE OF
THOSE WHO HAVE EARNED THEIR
TRUST. THAT TRUST IS REWARDED NOT JUST
WITH COMPENSATION BUT AUTHORITY AND RESOURCES.THE TRUMPS HAVE GIVEN A GIFT TO THOSE WHO KNOW THEM, AND APPROACH AND
OUTLOOK TO LIFE AND THAT WILL
ALWAYS GUIDE ME. BECAUSE OF THEM, I THINK BIGGER
AND IN WAYS I DIDN'T THINK WERE EVEN POSSIBLE. DONALD TRUMP HAS TOLD ME A
PERSON'S OWN WORK ETHIC AND
DRIVE ARE THE ONLY LIMITATIONS TO SUCCESS.
[APPLAUSE]
[APPLAUSE] I NOW KNOW THIS TO BE TRUE. IT ISN'T JUST A PLATITUDE. AT TRUMP WHINING ARRAY, IT IS REAL AND IT IS RARE. IT IS ACCOMPANIED BY RESPECT FOR
MY ACCOMPLISHMENTS AND THE OPPORTUNITY TO GROW PROFESSIONALLY. THAT IS A DIRECT RESULT OF TRUMPS LEADERSHIP, LEADERSHIP WE NEED MORE TODAY, MORE THAN EVER
IN OUR COUNTRY. THANK YOU.
[APPLAUSE]
(music)
>> PLEASE WELCOME DONALD TRUMP JUNIOR.

<strong>Donald Trump Jr.</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> GOOD EVENING. I'M DONALD TRUMP JUNIOR. THANK YOU. I'M THE FATHER OF FIVE YOUNG CHILDREN. I AM THE HUSBAND OF VANESSA AND
AMAZING WIFE AND MOTHER AND<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> THE
SON OF A GREAT MAN. I'M AN AMERICAN AND TONIGHT, I
WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THE
COUNTRY WE LIVE IN, THE COUNTRY
OUR CHILDREN WILL GROW UP IN. THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT ELECTION OF OUR LIFETIME, ONE
THAT WILL DETERMINE THE FUTURE
OF OUR COUNTRY AND IN TURN, THE FUTURE OF THE WORLD. FOR TOO LONG, OUR COUNTRY HAS
IGNORED ITS PROBLEM, PUNTING THEM DOWN THE ROAD. IN BUSINESS, I WAS TRAINED BY MY FATHER TO MAKE THE TOUGH INVESTMENTS AND DECISIONS TODAY
TO ENSURE A BRIGHTER FUTURE
TOMORROW. WE'VE ACTUALLY STARTED TO
BELIEVE THAT SOLVING OUR PROBLEMS IS AN IMPOSSIBLE TASK. THAT'S WHY WE NEED TO ELECT A
MAN WITH A TRACK RECORD OF ACCOMPLISHING THE IMPOSSIBLE.
[APPLAUSE] FOR THE FIRST TIME, PARENTS NO
LONGER THINK THEIR KIDS WILL BE
AS WELL OFF AS WE WERE. WE'VE LOST THE CONFIDENCE IN OUR LEADERS AND OUR INSTITUTIONS. WE ARE STILL AMERICANS, WE ARE
STILL ONE COUNTRY, AND WE ARE
GOING TO GET IT ALL BACK.
[APPLAUSE] WE ARE GOING TO GET IT BACK
BETTER THAN EVER BEFORE. I KNOW WE WILL GET IT BACK BECAUSE I KNOW MY FATHER. I KNOW THAT WHEN PEOPLE TELL HIM IT CAN'T BE DONE, THAT GUARANTEES HE GETS IT DONE. I KNOW WHEN SOMEONE TELLS HIM
SOMETHING IS IMPOSSIBLE, THAT'S WHAT TRIGGERS HIM INTO ACTION. WHEN PEOPLE TOLD HIM IT WAS
IMPOSSIBLE FOR A BOY FROM QUEENS
TO GO FROM RED HAT IN AND TAKE ON DEVELOPERS IN THE BIG CITY, RATHER THAN GIVE UP, HE CHANGED
THE SKYLINE OF NEW YORK. I'VE SEEN IT TIME AND TIME AGAIN, THAT LOOK IN HIS EYES WHEN SOMEONE SAYS IT CAN BE
DONE. I SAW THAT LOOK A LITTLE OVER A
YEAR AGO WHEN HE WAS TOLD HE
COULDN'T POSSIBLY SUCCEED IN
POLITICS. YES, HE DID. FOR MY FATHER, AND POSSIBLE IS
JUST THE STARTING POINT. THAT'S HOW HE APPROACHES BUSINESS PROJECTS, HOW HE
APPROACHES LIFE. WHETHER IT'S TEACHING HIS
GRANDDAUGHTER HOW TO SWING A
GOLF CLUB OR TACKLING THE TOUGHEST NEGOTIATIONS, HE'S ALWAYS FULLY COMMITTED. THAT'S WHY THE PERSON WHO WOULD NEVER RUN FOR OFFICE BEFORE STOOD ON THE STAGE 11 MONTHS AGO
IN THIS ARENA WITH 16
PROFESSIONAL POLITICIANS AND THIS WEEK, THAT SAME MAN WILL STAND BEFORE YOU AS OUR PARTY'S NOMINEE FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.
[APPLAUSE] AS A PROUD SON AND FAMILY
MEMBER, IT WAS ONE OF THE GREAT HONORS OF MY LIFE TO BE ABLE TO
PUT HIM OVER THE TOP IN THE
DELEGATE COUNT EARLIER TODAY. HIS UNRELENTING DETERMINATION IS
WHY HE WILL BECOME OUR NEXT
PRESIDENT. YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT KIND OF PRESIDENT HE WILL BE?
LET ME TELL YOU HOW HE RAN HIS BUSINESSES.
I WAS BY HIS SIDE ON JOB SITES
IN CONFERENCE ROOMS FROM THE
TIME I COULD WALK.
HE DIDN'T HIDE OUT BEHIND SOME DESK, HE SPENT HIS CAREER WITH REGULAR AMERICANS, HUNG OUT WITH GUYS ON CONSTRUCTION SITES,
POURING CONCRETE. HE LISTENED TO THEM AND VALUED THEIR OPINIONS AS MUCH AND OFTEN
MORE THAN THE GUYS FROM HARVARD
LOCKED AWAY IN OFFICES AWAY FROM
THE REAL WORK. HE HAS RECOGNIZED THE TALENT AND DRIVE ALL AMERICANS HAVE. HE'S PROMOTED PEOPLE BASED ON
THEIR CHARACTER AND WORK ETHIC. NOT SIMPLY CREDENTIALS. MANY OF THE TOP EXECUTIVES IN OUR COMPANY ARE INDIVIDUALS THAT
STARTED IN POSITIONS THAT WERE BLUE-COLLAR BUT HE STARTED
SOMETHING IN THEM AND PUSHED
THEM TO SUCCEED. HIS TRUE GIFT AS A LEADER IS HE
SEES THE POTENTIAL OF PEOPLE THEY DON'T SEE IN THEMSELVES.
[APPLAUSE] THE POTENTIAL THAT OTHER EXECUTIVES WOULD OVERLOOK
BECAUSE THEIR RESUMES DON'T INCLUDE THE NAMES OF FANCY COLLEGES AND DEGREES. THOSE ARE THE INDIVIDUALS HE HAD
MY SIBLINGS AND ME WORK UNDER
WHEN WE STARTED OUT.
HE WOULD TRUST HIS OWN CHILDREN'S FORMATIVE YEARS TO
THESE MEN AND WOMEN SAYS ALL YOU
NEED TO KNOW ABOUT DONALD TRUMP.
WE DIDN'T LEARN FROM MBA'S, WE
LEARNED FROM PEOPLE WITH DOCTORATES IN COMMON SENSE.
[APPLAUSE] GUYS LIKE VINNY WHO TAUGHT US
HOW TO DRIVE HEAVY EQUIPMENT AND OPERATE TRACTORS WHO WORKED HIS
WAY THROUGH THE RANKS TO BECOME
A TRUSTED ADVISOR OF MY FATHER. IT'S WHY WE'RE OUT THE ONLY CHILLED -- WE ARE THE ONLY
CHILDREN OF BILLIONAIRES
COMFORTABLE IN A D10 CATERPILLAR
AS WE ARE IN OUR OWN CARS. MY FATHER KNEW THOSE WERE THE
GUYS THAT WOULD TEACH US THE
DIGNITY OF HARD WORK. HE KNOWS THE HEART OF THE
AMERICAN DREAM IS THE IDEA THAT
WHOEVER WE ARE, WE CAN GET AHEAD
, WHERE EVERYONE CAN PROSPER
TOGETHER. THE OTHER PARTY ALSO TELLS US THEY BELIEVE IN THE AMERICAN DREAM. THEY SAY WE SHOULD WORRY ABOUT ECONOMIC INEQUALITY AND
IMMOBILITY. THEY ARE RIGHT. BUT THEY DON'T TELL YOU THAT IT
WAS THEIR POLICIES THAT CAUSED
THE PROBLEM AND THEIR POLICIES
THAT HAVE NO ACCOUNTABILITY.
[APPLAUSE] THEY GAVE US THE WORST
IMMIGRATION SYSTEM IN THE WORLD, ONE THAT IMPORT IMMOBILITY,
DRIVES DOWN EMPLOYMENT AND WAGES FOR HISPANICS, AFRICAN-AMERICANS. AN IMMIGRATION SYSTEM THAT
FAVORS ILLEGALS OVER THOSE TRIED
TO GO THROUGH THE PROCESS LEGALLY AND AT TIMES, EVEN OVER
LAW-ABIDING CITIZENS. IT WAS BERNIE SANDERS WHO SAID A
LARGE TIDE OF NEW WORKERS KEEPS
LOW AND POVERTY HIGH.
THE OTHER PARTY GAVE US PUBLIC SCHOOLS THAT FAR TOO OFTEN FAIL
OUR STUDENTS, AS ACTUALLY THOSE
WITH NO OPTIONS. MY SIBLINGS AND I GROWING UP
WERE TRULY FORTUNATE TO HAVE CHOICES AND OPTIONS THAT OTHERS DON'T.
WE WANT ALL AMERICANS TO HAVE
THOSE SAME OPPORTUNITIES.
[APPLAUSE] OUR SCHOOLS USED TO BE AN
ELEVATOR TO THE MIDDLE CLASS.
NOW THEY ARE STALLED ON THE
GROUND FLOOR. FOR THE TEACHERS AND THE
ADMINISTRATORS AND NOT THE
STUDENTS. YOU KNOW WHAT OTHER COUNTRIES DO BETTER K-12, THEY LET PARENTS CHOOSE TO -- WHERE TO SEND THEIR
CHILDREN TO SCHOOL. IT'S CALLED A FREE MARKET AND
IT'S WHAT THE OTHER PARTY FEARS. THEY FEAR IT BECAUSE THEY ARE
MORE CONCERNED ABOUT PROTECTING THE JOBS OF TENURED TEACHERS
THEN SERVING THE STUDENTS IN
DESPERATE NEED OF A GOOD
EDUCATION.
[APPLAUSE] THEY WANT TO RUN EVERYTHING TOP-DOWN.
THEY TELL US THEY ARE THE EXPERTS. THE OTHER PARTY GAVE US A REGULATORY STATE. DODD FRANK WAS 11 PAGES LONG AND
IT'S ALREADY 22,000 PAGES IN
REGULATIONS. IMAGINE TRYING TO DIGEST THAT BEFORE YOU OPEN YOUR DOORS FOR
BUSINESS. THAT DOESN'T HELP CONSUMERS. IT THE STORIES SMALL BUSINESS IN
FAVOR OF BIG BUSINESS WHO CAN AFFORD LAWYERS AND ACCOUNTANTS NEEDED TO COMPLY. DODD FRANK IS CONSUMER
PROTECTION FOR BILLIONAIRES. WE HAVE PRODUCED THE BIGGEST NETWORK OF INFLUENCE IN ANY
COUNTRY AT ANY TIME IN WORLD HISTORY. IT'S COMPOSED OF A
SELF-SATISFIED PEOPLE AT THE
TOP. WE CAN'T LIVE THAT WAY ANY
LONGER. IT'S TOO RISKY. LET ME TALK ABOUT RISK. THE OTHER PARTY IS THE PARTY OF
RISK. I'VE SPENT MANY TIME WITH MANY
GREAT AMERICANS WHO HAVE SERVED
THIS COUNTRY AND THEY KNOW WHAT
IS AT STAKE. WHEN WE HAVE A WEAK LEADERS AND
POSITION OF POWER, AMERICANS
RISKING THEIR LIVES ARE LESS SAFE. ALMOST DAILY I GET A CALL OR
TEXT FROM A REAL AMERICAN HERO.
I'M PROUD TO CALL HIM A FRIEND. MARK WAS PART OF THE SECURITY TEAM AT THE ANNEX IN BENGHAZI.
MARK WAS ONE OF THE MEN WHO
RECEIVED FRANTIC PHONE CALLS
FROM HIS FRIENDS AT THE COMPOUND
THAT PLEADED FOR HELP. CALLS HE AND HIS TEAM TRIED TO ANSWER. SECRETARY CLINTON'S STATE
DEPARTMENT IGNORED THEIR REQUEST
FOR HELP ON THE NIGHT IN QUESTION AND IN THE WEEKS AND MONTHS LEADING UP TO THE ATTACK. IT WAS A TRAGEDY AND ONE THAT WOULD BE REPEATED SHOULD SHE
WHEN THE ELECTION. WHO WILL TAKE THAT CALL OUR 3:00
IN THE MORNING? ASK YOURSELF IF YOU WERE IN MARK'S SHOES THAT NIGHT, WHO
WOULD YOU RATHER CALL? LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING ABOUT
RISK. IF HILLARY CLINTON WERE ELECTED,
SHE WOULD BE THE FIRST PRESIDENT
WHO COULDN'T PASS A BASIC
BACKGROUND CHECK.
[APPLAUSE] IT'S INCREDIBLE. SHE ONCE TO A PORT JUDGES WHO -- APPOINT JUDGES WHO WILL ABOLISH
THE SECOND AMENDMENT. LOOK HOW EFFECTIVE THOSE LAWS HAVE BEEN AN INNER-CITY CHICAGO. WHERE OVER 3400 AMERICAN LIVES
HAVE BEEN LOST SINCE THIS
ADMINISTRATION TOOK OFFICE IN 2009. CRIMINALS BY DEFINITION DON'T FOLLOW LAWS.
[APPLAUSE] RATHER THAN PROSECUTING REAL CRIMINALS, SHE WOULD STRIP
LAW-ABIDING CITIZENS FROM THE
ABILITY TO PROTECT THEIR
FAMILIES. RATHER THAN BEING ENERGY
INDEPENDENT, OUR COUNTRY WILL BE FORCED TO REMAIN BEHOLDEN TO HER
BUDDIES IN THE MIDDLE EAST. THOSE ARE RISKS WE CANNOT AFFORD
TO TAKE AND WHEN WE WIN, WE WILL
NOT HAVE TO. THERE IS SO MUCH WORK TO DO. WE WILL NOT ACCEPT THE CURRENT STATE OF OUR COUNTRY BECAUSE
IT'S TOO HARD TO CHANGE. THAT'S NOT THE AMERICA I KNOW. WE WILL UNLEASH THE CREATIVE
SPIRIT AND ENERGY OF ALL
AMERICANS. WE WILL MAKE OUR SCHOOLS THE BEST IN THE WORLD FOR EVERY
SINGLE AMERICAN ON EVERY
ETHNICITY AND BACKGROUND.
[APPLAUSE] WE ARE GOING TO PUT AMERICANS
FIRST, ALL AMERICANS, NOT A
SPECIAL CLASS OF ELITES AT THE
TOP. WE ARE GOING TO ELECT A
PRESIDENT WHO WILL WORK WITH
EVERYONE TO PASS LEGISLATION TO MAKE OUR COUNTRY GREAT AGAIN. A PRESIDENT WHO WILL GIVE US A
TAX CODE THAT WILL FREE THE
AMERICAN ECONOMY AND ANY SPECIAL
LOOPHOLES FOR THE WEALTHY. A PRESIDENT WHO WILL GIVE US AN
IMMIGRATION LAW THAT PROTECTS
AMERICAN CITIZENS AND GIVES THEM
JOBS. A PRESIDENT WHO WILL REPEAL AND REPLACE OBAMACARE WITHOUT
LEAVING OUR MOST VULNERABLE CITIZENS WITHOUT HEALTH CARE AND
WHO WILL DO IT WITHOUT DESTROYING MEDICARE FOR SENIORS
LIKE HILLARY CLINTON HAS
PROPOSED. A PRESIDENT WHO KNOWS WE CAN'T
SIMPLY DELETE OUR PROBLEMS BUT THAT WE HAVE TO TACKLE THEM HEAD-ON.
[APPLAUSE] A PRESIDENT WHO WON'T ALLOW PC CULTURE TO PUT THE SAFETY AND
SECURITY OF OUR CHILDREN AT STAKE, A PRESIDENT WHO WON'T
PANDER TO NATIONS WHO SHUDDER AT
THE THOUGHT OF AMERICA'S
EXISTENCE. A PRESIDENT MORE CONCERNED WITH THE SAFETY AND COMFORT OF HIS FELLOW AMERICANS THAN THE FEELINGS OF THOSE HOSTILE
NATIONS ABROAD WHO IF GIVEN THE
OPTION WOULD WIPE AMERICA OFF
THE FACE OF THIS EARTH.
[APPLAUSE] A PRESIDENT NOT BEHOLDEN TO SPECIAL INTERESTS FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC AND ONE WHO FUNDED HIS ENTIRE PRIMARY RUN OUT OF HIS OWN POCKET JUST TO PROVE IT.
A PRESIDENT WHO WILL SECURE AND DEFEND THE BORDERS OF THE UNITED STATES" FOR JUDGES. A PRESIDENT WHO WON'T USE THE
HIGHEST OFFICE IN THE LAND AS A PASTOR PERSONAL -- PAT TO
PERSONAL ENRICHMENT. A PRESIDENT WHO'S ACTUALLY
CREATED REAL JOBS, WHO CREATED
-- A SIGN THE FRONT OF A
PAYCHECK AND DOESN'T TALK ABOUT
IT IN THEORY, A PRESIDENT WHO
HAS REAL PEOPLE FAMILIES AND LIVELIHOODS DEPENDENT ON HIS
SUCCESS AND COMPANIES FOR DECADES. THE PRESIDENT WHO SPEAKS HIS MIND, WHO DOESN'T HAVE TO RUN A
FOCUS GROUP OR USE DATA ANALYTICS TO FORM A SIMPLE OPINION.
[APPLAUSE] WHO SAYS WHAT NEEDS TO BE SAID AND NOT JUST WHAT YOU WANT TO HEAR.
[APPLAUSE] A PRESIDENT WHO WILL UNLEASH THE
GREATNESS AND OUR NATION AND IN
ALL OF US, WHO WILL GIVE THE
HARD-WORKING MEN AND WOMEN WHO
BUILT THIS GREAT COUNTRY A VOICE ONCE AGAIN. THAT PRESIDENT CAN ONLY BE MY MENTOR, MY BEST FRIEND, MY FATHER, DONALD TRUMP.
[APPLAUSE] AND WHEN WE ELECT HIM, WE WILL HAVE DONE ALL OF THAT.
WE WILL HAVE MADE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, GREATER THAN EVER BEFORE.
[APPLAUSE] THANK YOU AND GOD BLESS.

<strong>Shelley Moore Capito</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> LET ME START OUT WITH A
QUESTION. ARE THERE ANY MOUNTAIN YEARS IN
THE AUDIENCE TONIGHT? I'M SHELLY, THE FIRST WOMAN EVER
ELECTED TO SERVE THIS DATE<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> OF
WEST VIRGINIA IN UNITED STATES
SENATE. WE FACE CHALLENGING TIMES. TIMES IN WHICH WE AS LEADERS MUST ASK HOW CAN WE SECURE A FUTURE THAT IS BRIGHTER FOR NEXT GENERATION?
THAT'S ALWAYS THE CHALLENGE OF
LEADERSHIP AND THIS ELECTION IS
NO DIFFERENT. WITH TALENT COMES OPPORTUNITY
AND THAT IS WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO'S WEAK TO YOU ABOUT TONIGHT.
LET ME FIRST TELL YOU WHERE I COME FROM, THE MOUNTAIN STATE. I'M A LIFELONG WEST VIRGINIA IN AND WITH OUR TIGHTKNIT
COMMUNITIES, I SAY OUR STATE IS ONE BIG SMALL TOWN.
THAT'S NEVER BEEN MORE EVIDENT
THAN IN THE PAST MONTH AS WEST
VIRGINIA WAS RAVAGED BY FLOODING
THAT UPENDED OUR COMMUNITIES,
DISPLACED OUR FAMILIES, AND
CLAIMED 23 LIVES. AS I TRAVELED THE FLOOD ZONES, I
WAS INSPIRED BY PEOPLE WHO
DESPITE LOSING EVERYTHING SOUGHT
WAYS TO HELP AND SERVE OTHERS. THE STORIES ARE SO TRAGIC YET SO UPLIFTING. AND I AM SO PROUD OF MY STATE. AND THEIR JOBS AND COMMUNITIES,
WEST VIRGINIANS WORK HARD
EVERYDAY AND DELIVER RESULTS AND IN TURN, THEY EXPECT OUR
COUNTRY'S LEADERS TO DO THE
SAME. THE CONSTANT REFRAIN I HEAR BACK
HOME IS STOP THE BICKERING,
IMPROVE THE ECONOMY, AND FIGHT
FOR OUR JOBS. LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING, THEY ARE RIGHT. THE GREATEST OBSTACLE FOR WEST
VIRGINIA FAMILIES AND FAMILIES ACROSS AMERICA OVER THE PAST EIGHT YEARS HAS BEEN A PRESIDENT
THAT PLACES LEFT WING PRIORITIES AND CAMPAIGN PROMISES OVER THEIR
LIVELIHOOD. PRESIDENT OBAMA HAS HURT THE
HEART AND SOUL OF MY STATE, ARE
PRAVACHOL MINORS INTO
COMMUNITIES WHERE THEY LIVE AND WORK AND PURSUE THEIR HAPPINESS. HIS POLICY THAT RIPPED THROUGH
THE HEARTLAND, CREATING A CYCLE
OF PESSIMISM AND DISCUSSED. PEOPLE AROUND THE COUNTRY FEEL
THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION HAS
KICKED THEM TO THE CURB WITH A CALLOUSNESS THAT DAMAGE THEIR ABILITY TO TRUST GOVERNMENT. IN 2008, PRESIDENT OBAMA FAMOUSLY SAID IF SOMEONE WANTS TO BUILD A COAL POWER PLANT, THEY CAN. IT'S JUST THAT IT WILL BANKRUPT
THEM. EIGHT YEARS LATER, IT IS SAFE TO SAY HIS ACTIONS HAVE MATCHED HIS
WORDS. BUT HE NEVER REALIZED WHEN YOU
BANKRUPT THE COAL COMPANY, YOU
PROVIDE -- TO PRIDE COMMUNITIES
OF THEIR -- DEPRIVE COMMUNITIES
OF THEIR LIVELIHOOD. HIS RECKLESSNESS HAS COST MORE THAN 60,000 WORKERS THEIR JOB SINCE 2011. THAT'S 60,000 FAMILIES WITHOUT A WORK, WITHOUT A PAYCHECK. NOT TO BE OUTDONE, HILLARY
CLINTON HAS ALREADY PROMISED TO
PUT A LOT OF COAL MINERS AND COAL COMPANIES OUT OF BUSINESS. SHE WANTS TO PUT THOUSANDS MORE
AMERICANS OUT OF WORK. SHE HAS PROMISED TO DEVASTATE
COMMUNITIES AND FAMILIES ACROSS
COLD COUNTRY. WHEN I THINK ABOUT HILLARY
CLINTON'S PURSUIT OF AN ANTI-COAL AGENDA, YOU KNOW WHAT I THINK ABOUT? ABOUT MINOR THAT WAKES UP BEFORE
DON EVERY DAY TO GO TO A 10 HOUR
SHIFT, THAT BUS DRIVER WHO
DRIVES THE CHILDREN TO SCHOOL, THE NURSE WHO CARES FOR OUR
RETIRED MINERS COME AND THE
HUNDREDS OF COAL EQUIPMENT DISTRIBUTORS. I WEEP FOR THE FABRIC OF MY STATE. I WEEP FOR THE FABRIC OF MY
STATE. THESE MEN AND WOMAN TAKE PRIDE IN THEIR JOBS THAT PROVIDE FOR
THEIR FAMILIES AND SUPPORT THEIR COMMUNITY. THEY WORKED TIRELESSLY TO POWER AMERICA.
WEST VIRGINIA WORKERS ARE THE BACKBONE OF THIS ECONOMY AND
HILLARY CLINTON SOMETHING TO PUT THEM OUT OF WORK. WE SHOULDN'T BE SURPRISED BECAUSE HILLARY IS UNDERSTANDS COAL MINERS IN WHAT FOLLOW
WORKERS AS WELL AS SHE UNDERSTANDS SECURE E-MAIL. A DAY IN THE LIFE OF A COAL
MINER AND THE DAY IN THE LIFE OF
HILLARY CLINTON COULD NOT BE MORE DIFFERENT. FOR OVER 25 YEARS, SHE HAS
THRIVED IN A WORLD WHERE THE RULES BEND TO HER.
RECENTLY, WE LEARNED SHE SHOWED EXTREME CARELESSNESS WITH OUR NATIONS SECRETS. FOR OTHERS, THE CONSEQUENCES OF MISUSING CLASSIFIED INFORMATION HAVE IN SWIFT AND SERIOUS BUT NOT FOR HILLARY CLINTON. SINCE THE END OF HER HUSBAND'S
ADMINISTRATION, SHE HAS PROFITED FROM CLOSED-DOOR SPEECHES WITH
FEES THAT WOULD BUY SEVERAL
HOUSES IN THE STATE OF WEST VIRGINIA.
NOT THE IS SHE OUT OF TOUCH, HER ATTEMPTS TO REACH OUT TO THE
AMERICAN PEOPLE OFTEN REVEAL HOW DISTORTED HER VISION HAS BECOME.
BUT WHAT I FIND MOST TROUBLING IS THAT HILLARY CLINTON FAILS TO RECOGNIZE ALL CAPS RELATED
POLICIES AFFECT REAL PEOPLE. THOSE WHO WANT TO FEED THEIR
FAMILY, OWN HOMES, PAY FOR
COLLEGE, ASSUME THE AMERICAN DREAM. THESE GOALS SHOULD NOT AND CANNOT FALL OUT OF REACH. IT MAY FEEL LIKE PRESIDENT OBAMA
AIR CURRENTLY PROCLAIMED HE
WOULD SLOW THE RISE OF THE OCEANS. HE INTRODUCED AND IMPLEMENTED SWEEPING ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS WITHOUT CONGRESS APPROVAL AND WITHOUT ANY
CONSIDERATION FOR THE ECONOMY. THESE UNILATERAL ACTIONS ARE ILL-INFORMED AND FRANKLY
UNCONSTITUTIONAL. RIGHT NOW, THE BURDEN OF GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS IN THIS COUNTRY AMOUNTS TO $15,000 A HOUSEHOLD. SO LET ME ASK YOU A QUESTION.
ARE YOU READY? IS A BURDENING EVERY HOUSEHOLD IN AMERICA WITH THE COST OF
$15,000 WORTH MORE APPLAUSE
LINES AT CAMPAIGN RALLIES? IS BURDENING EVERY HOUSEHOLD IN AMERICA WITH 15,000 DOLLARS
WORTH MORE CAMPAIGN CASH? IS BURDENING EVERY HOUSEHOLD IN AMERICA WITH $15,000 WORTH A FEW
MORE ONE-LINERS? I COULDN'T AGREE WITH YOU MORE
AND I'M SURE YOU AGREE WITH ME
ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS
ELECTION.
[APPLAUSE] ONE OF THE REASONS THIS ELECTION IS SO IMPORTANT IS BECAUSE THE
DEMOCRATS HAVE NOMINATED A CANDIDATE THAT AMERICANS OVERWHELMINGLY DISTRESSED -- DAVISISTRUST. HER TURN AT THE STATE DEPARTMENT
WAS SHROUDED IN SCANDAL. A FEW WEEKS AGO, THE FBI DIRECTOR SAID SECRETARY CLINTON
WAS NEGLIGENT, QUESTIONED HER
JUDGMENT, AND REVEALED COUNTLESS
WAYS SHE HAS MISLED THE AMERICAN
PEOPLE. WE KNOW THAT THE CORNERSTONE OF
OUR GLOBAL LEADERSHIP IS NOT JUST OUR AWESOME MILITARY, NOT
JUST OUR ECONOMIC POWER, BUT OUR CREDIBILITY. SHE HAS SQUANDERED AMERICAN'S TRUST AND THANKFULLY, THE LATEST HASN'T SLIPPED PAST THE
ATTENTION OF THE AMERICAN
PEOPLE. RECENT POLLS SHOW VOTERS
DISTRUST OF HILLARY WAS
DETERIORATING HER SUPPORT. SO IT DOES COME DOWN TO TRUST. SHE CANNOT BE TRUSTED WITH CLASSIFIED INFORMATION OR TRUSTED TO PLAY BY THE SAME
RULES THAT YOU AND I PLAY BY AND WITHOUT TRUST, WE CANNOT FEEL
SAFE AND WE CANNOT THRIVE. NO ONE WHO HAS LOST THE TRUST OF
THE AMERICAN PEOPLE SHOULD EVER
SERVE AS OUR PRESIDENT.
[APPLAUSE] SEN. CAPITO: THE ONLY THING WE
CAN TRUST HILLARY TO DO IS TO
DOUBLE DOWN ON THE SAME FAILED OBAMA POLICIES THAT ARE HURTING AMERICANS THAT I JUST DESCRIBED. WE KNOW SHE WILL DOUBLE DOWN ON
AN ECONOMIC AGENDA THAT HAS MADE
THE LOWEST WORKFORCE
PARTICIPATION IN DECADES.
WE KNOW THAT SHE WILL DOUBLE
DOWN ON THE WAR ON COAL. WE KNOW THAT SHE WILL DOUBLE DOWN ON OBAMACARE. WE KNOW THAT SHE WILL DOUBLE DOWN ON FAR LESS SUPREME COURT NOMINEES.
[BOOING] SEN. CAPITO: WE KNOW THAT SHE
WILL DOUBLE DOWN ON THE
CATASTROPHIC FOREIGN POLICY THAT
SHE HERSELF HAS ORCHESTRATED.
[BOOING] SEN. CAPITO: THE CONTRAST BETWEEN OUR VISION FOR THE
FUTURE AND THAT OF HILLARY CLINTON IS CLEAR.
NOW IS THE TIME TO TURN THE TIDE
. ARE YOU WITH ME? LET US TURN THE TIDE. SO THAT UNELECTED BUREAUCRATS NO LONGER MANDATE REGULATIONS THAT
ARE DISCONNECTED FROM THE
REALITIES OF WORKING AMERICANS. LET US TURN THE TIDE FROM AN EXECUTIVE WHO PROMOTES RADICAL ENVIRONMENTAL AGENDA THAT RAISES COSTS ACROSS THIS COUNTRY. LET US TURN THE TIDE FROM A WASHINGTON THAT TELLS US WHO ARE DOCTORS ARE AND DELIVERS A LOWER QUALITY OF CARE. LET US TURN THE TIDE TO A GOVERNMENT THAT RESPECTS THE CONSTITUTION AND TAX JOBS -- PROTECTS JOBS AND THE WAY OF
LIFE IN RURAL AMERICA. THIS IS NOT OUT OF REACH. WE CAN MAKE THESE VISIONS A
REALITY. THIS WEEK, WE WILL OFFICIALLY
NOMINATE A CANDIDATE WHO
RECEIVED THE MOST PRIMARY VOTES
IN THE HISTORY OF OUR PARTY.
A CANDIDATE WHO UNDERSTANDS HOW
TO CREATE JOBS AND GROW THE
ECONOMY. OUR PARTY WANTS TO ALLOW
BUSINESSES TO CREATE JOBS, NOT REGULATE JOBS OUT OF EXISTENCE. OUR PARTY UNDERSTANDS THE FREE
MARKET AND DOES NOT TRY TO
CONTROL IT. OUR PARTY STANDS UP FOR
HARD-WORKING AMERICANS MIGHT MY
HARD-WORKING WEST VIRGINIA COAL
MINERS.
[CHEERING] SEN. CAPITO: OUR PARTY WILL
STRENGTHEN OUR MILITARY TO FACE
GROWING THREATS. WE MUST CARRY THIS MOMENTUM TO
ELECT DONALD TRUMP, WHO SPEAKS
DIRECTLY TO AMERICANS WHO HAVE BEEN DEVASTATED BY THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION.
WEST VIRGINIANS KNOW HE
UNDERSTANDS THEIR PROBLEMS.
SHARES THEIR CONCERNS.
BY GOLLY, HE IS GOING TO DO
THINGS MUCH DIFFERENTLY. THE AMERICAN PEOPLE KNOW THAT
HILLARY CLINTON HAS FORFEITED HER TRUST AND HAS BROKEN HER
BOND WITH WORKING AMERICANS. SO, LET US COMMIT TONIGHT TO
BRINGING OUR COUNTRY TOGETHER IN
THE MONTHS AHEAD.
MISTAKES ARE BOTH CLEAR AND
HIGH.
TAKE THIS ENERGY FROM THIS -- THE STAKES ARE BOTH CLEAR AND
HIGH. TAKE THIS ENERGY TO ELECT DONALD TRUMP, WHO WILL MAKE AMERICA
RATE AGAIN.
THANK YOU.
