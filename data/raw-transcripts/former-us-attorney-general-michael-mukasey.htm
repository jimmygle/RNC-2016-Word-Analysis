<strong>Michael B. Mukasey</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> YOU KNOW, OVER THE YEARS HILLARY CLINTON HAS DONE A LOT OF THINGS AND SAID A LOT OF THINGS TO SHOW WHY SHE SHOULD
NOT BE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED
STATES.<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> BUT HOW SHE TREATED AND WHAT SHE DID WITH GOVERNMENT SECRETS WHEN
SHE WAS SECRETARY OF STATE AND
WHAT SHE SAID ABOUT WHAT YOU DID
BOTH BEFORE AND AFTER SHE GOT CAUGHT EXQUISITELY SUMS UP THE
CASE AGAINST HER PRESIDENCY. SHE SENT AND RECEIVED SECRET AND TOP-SECRET AND BEYOND TOP-SECRET INFORMATION ON AN UNSECURED PRIVATE E-MAIL SYSTEM INSTEAD OF
ON THE SECURE GOVERNMENT SYSTEM. AND SHE DID IT WITHOUT AUTHORIZATION. SHE SAID FALSELY THAT THERE WAS
NO CLASSIFIED INFORMATION. SHE SAID FALSELY THAT WHAT SHE
DID WAS AUTHORIZED. WHAT ELSE DID SHE SAY? SHE SAID, AND THESE ARE HER WORDS, WHEN WE TRAVEL TO
SENSITIVE PLACES LIKE RUSSIA, WE
OFTEN RECEIVE WARNINGS FROM DEPARTMENT SECURITY OFFICIALS TO
LEAVE OUR BLACKBERRIES, LAPTOPS,
ANYTHING THAT COMMUNICATED WITH
THE OUTSIDE WORLD ON THE PLANE
WITH THEIR BATTERIES REMOVED TO
PREVENT FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE
SERVICES FROM COMPROMISING THEM. AND THEN SHE ADDED FALSELY, EVEN
IN FRIENDLY SETTINGS YOU
CONDUCTED BUSINESS UNDER SECRET SECURITY PRECAUTIONS, TAKING CARE OF WHEN AND HOW WE READ SECRET MATERIALS AND USE OUR
TECHNOLOGY. THAT IS FROM HER BOOK THAT IS
FROM HER BOOK, TITLED IRONICALLY
"HARD CHOICES." HARD CHOICES INDEED. IN REALITY, WE NOW KNOW THAT SHE CHOSE TO USE HER PRIVATE E-MAIL OVERSEAS IN COUNTRIES THAT WERE
HOSTILE TO THE UNITED STATES, AND THAT HAVE SOPHISTICATED
HACKING CAPABILITY. ALTHOUGH HER SISTER WAS SO REMARKABLY PRIMITIVE THE FBI
COULD NOT FIGURE OUT WHETHER OR
NOT IT HAD BEEN HACKED, WE KNOW
THAT THE E-MAILS OF THOSE SHE
COMMUNICATED WITH WERE HACKED. SO I GUESS ABOUT HER E-MAILS, WE WILL SOON HEAR THE SAME INFAMOUS QUESTION THAT WE HEARD ABOUT THE
DEATH OF FOUR AMERICANS AND
BENGHAZI. WHAT DIFFERENCE AT THIS POINT DOESN'T MAKE -- DOES IT MAKE? SECRETARY CLINTON, IT MAKES A
BIG DIFFERENCE. THE UNITED STATES IS THE ONLY
COUNTRY IN THE WORLD THAT WAS FOUNDED NOT ON BLOOD OR LAND, BUT BASED ON A LAW. THE CONSTITUTION. HILLARY CLINTON IS RUNNING FOR THE PRESIDENCY, WHOSE POWERS AND DUTIES ARE DEFINED BY THAT LAW. THE MOST IMPORTANT POWER THAT
THAT LAW GIVES THE PRESIDENT IS
TO BE COMMANDER IN CHIEF OF THE
ARMED FORCES. THAT LAW IMPOSES ONLY ONE
SUBSTANTIVE DUTY ON THE PRESIDENT. AND THAT IS, AS WRITTEN IN THE CONSTITUTION, TO TAKE CARE THAT
THE LAWS BE FAITHFULLY EXECUTED. THAT LAW, THE CONSTITUTION, SPECIFICALLY REQUIRES THAT YOU
FOR TAKING UP THOSE HOURS OF
DUTY, THE PRESIDENT SWEARS TO AN
OUT/ AND IT'S THE ONLY OLD SET FORTH
FROM THE CONSTITUTION -- ONLY BOTH -- SET FORTH ONLY OATH IN
THE CONSTITUTION. HILLARY CLINTON TOOK A SIMILAR OATH BEFORE SHE BECAME SECRETARY OF STATE. DO YOU KNOW WHAT THAT ADDS UP
TO? HILLARY CLINTON IS ASKING THE
PEOPLE OF THIS COUNTRY AND THE UNITED STATES TO MAKE HER THE FIRST PRESIDENT IN HISTORY TO
TAKE THE CONSTITUTIONAL OATH OF OFFICE AFTER ALREADY HAVING
VIOLATED IT.
[APPLAUSE] THE MESSAGE FROM THIS CONVENTION
FOR EVERYONE WATCHING THESE PROCEEDINGS, AND THE MESSAGE TO HER SHOULD BE LOUD, CLEAR, AND SHORT. NO WAY, HILLARY. NO WAY ON EARTH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

<strong>Andrew Wist</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> THANK YOU. IT'S GREAT TO BE HERE. IT HAS BEEN FUN WATCHING THE
MEDIA SPECULATE ABOUT ME.
WHO IS ANDY WIST? SOMEONE SAYS I WAS THAT MEN. I SAID THAT<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> WAS ADAM WEST. SOME OF THESE REPORTERS NEED TO
GET A LIFE. DO YOU WANT TO KNOW WHO ENDED WIST -- ANDY WIST IS? I AM PROOF THAT THE AMERICAN
DREAM IS REAL. I STARTED A BUSINESS IN MY
MOTHER'S BACKYARD WHEN I WAS 21
YEARS OLD. STANDARD WATERPROOFING. WE RESTORE BUILDING EXTERIORS.
TODAY WE HAVE A HUNDRED 40
EMPLOYEES. NOT AS GOOD AS MR. TRUMP'S COMPANY, BUT STILL PRETTY GOOD
RIGHT?
[APPLAUSE] I AM ALSO THE TRUSTEE OF THE
LOCAL 522. LIKE DONALD TRUMP AND MIKE PENCE, I BELIEVE THAT WORKING
MEN AND WOMEN STILL MATTER IN
THIS COUNTRY. WE HAVE TO LOOK OUT FOR THEM.
[APPLAUSE] AFTER EIGHT YEARS OF PRESIDENT OBAMA, I DON'T SEE THE AMERICAN DREAM LIKE I DID WHEN I WAS
STARTING OUT. ALL I SEE IS TOO MANY PEOPLE OUT OF WORK, TOO MANY JOBS SHIFT OVERSEAS, AND TOO MANY COEFFICIENTS THAT DO NOT CARE -- POLITICIANS THAT DO NOT CARE. GOOGLE FIX IT? HILLARY CLINTON?
-- WHO WILL FIX IT? HILLARY
CLINTON? HER ONLY A COMPLIMENT IS BEATING THE RAP EVERY TIME SHE BEATS -- BREAKS THE LAW.
[APPLAUSE] DONALD TRUMP IS A BUILDER. HE IS A LEADER THAT WILL BRING US TOGETHER. HE WILL MAKE AMERICA WORK AGAIN SO THAT WE CAN BELIEVE AGAIN. I AM NOT A BIG IMPORTANT PERSON. I AM JUST A REGULAR GUY. I LOVE MY COUNTRY AND HAVE LIVED A GREAT LIFE. I'M NOT GOING TO BE AROUND
FOREVER AND NEITHER WILL YOU. THIS NOVEMBER WE GET TO DECIDE WHAT KIND OF WORLD WE LIVE
BEHIND. WHEN I AM GONE I WANT MY
CHILDREN AND YOUR CHILDREN AND OUR GRANDCHILDREN TO BE ABLE TO
LIVE THE AMERICAN DREAM LIKE I
HAVE. AND THE ONLY WAY WE KEEP THE
AMERICAN DREAM ALIVE IS BY ELECTING DONALD TRUMP PRESIDENT. THANK YOU. GOD BLESS DONALD TRUMP AND GOD
BLESS AMERICA.
