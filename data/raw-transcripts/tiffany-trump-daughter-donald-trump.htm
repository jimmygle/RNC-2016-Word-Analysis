<strong>Tiffany Trump</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> IT'S SO AMAZING TO BE WITH
YOU TONIGHT AND SAY A FEW WORDS
ABOUT MY FATHER. PLEASE EXCUSE ME IF I'M A LITTLE
NERVOUS.
WHEN I GRADUATED COLLEGE A COUPLE<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> MONTHS AGO, I NEVER
EXPECTED TO BE HERE TONIGHT
ADDRESSING THE NATION. I'VE GIVEN A FEW SPEECHES IN
FRONT OF CLASSROOMS AND STUDENTS
BUT NEVER IN AN ARENA WITH MORE
THAN 10 MILLION PEOPLE WATCHING.
[APPLAUSE] BUT LIKE MY FATHER, I NEVER BACK
DOWN FROM CHALLENGES SO HERE I
AM A LITTLE NEW TO THE
CONVENTION SCENE BUT INCREDIBLY HONORED AND VERY CONFIDENT IN
THE GOOD MAN AMERICA IS COMING
TO KNOW.
[APPLAUSE] IT'S OFTEN SAID THAT WITH ENOUGH EFFORT AND DETERMINATION, YOU CAN DO WHATEVER YOU PUT YOUR MIND TO BUT SAYING THOSE WORDS
AND LIVING THEM ARE DIFFERENT THINGS AND MY FATHER HAS LIVED
THEM.
[APPLAUSE] IT'S ONE OF HIS DEFINING QUALITIES AND I'VE SEEN IT IN
ACTION ALL MY LIFE.
WHATEVER HE DOES, HE GIVES HIS ALL AND DOES IT WELL. HIS DESIRE FOR EXCELLENCE IS
CONTAGIOUS. HE POSSESSES A UNIQUE SKILL IN BRINGING THAT OUT AND OTHERS.
HE'S ALWAYS HELPED ME BE THE
BEST VERSION OF MYSELF BY ENCOURAGEMENT AND EXAMPLE. HE MOTIVATES ME TO WORK MY HARDEST AND ALWAYS STAY TRUE TO
WHO I AM AND WHAT I BELIEVE. HE DRAWS OUT THAT HOWLAND'S AND
DRY -- TALENTS AND DRIVE IN
PEOPLE. THAT'S A GREAT QUALITY TO HAVE
IN A FATHER AND BETTER YET, THE
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.
[APPLAUSE] AS A RECENT COLLEGE GRADUATE, MANY OF MY ACCOMPLISHMENTS ARE
STILL TO COME BUT MY DAD TAKES
SUCH PRIDE IN ALL AND DONE SO
FAR NO MATTER HOW BIG OR SMALL. I STILL KEEP ALL MY REPORT CARDS BECAUSE I LIKE TO LOOK BACK AND SEE THE SWEET NOTES HE WROTE ON EACH AND EVERY ONE OF THEM. CONTRARY TO WHAT YOU MIGHT
EXPECT FROM SOMEONE WHO PLACES
AN EMPHASIS ON RESULTS, HIS
COMMENTS OFTEN REFERRED OFF INTO
THE SENTIMENTS EXPRESSED BY MY TEACHERS ABOUT HOW I ACTED IN
AND OUT OF THE CLASSROOM. DONALD TRUMP HAS NEVER DONE ANYTHING HALFWAY, LEAST OF ALL AS A PARENT. MY FATHER ALWAYS ASKED ABOUT MY FAMILY IN GEORGIA TO MAKE SURE THEY ARE HEALTHY AND SAFE. MY UNCLE SERVED IN THE ANON AND
MY GREAT GRANDFATHER SERVED IN
WORLD WAR II.
[APPLAUSE] TO ME, THE MEASURE OF A PARENT
IS BASED ON HOW THEY SUPPORT AND
BOLSTER YOU WHEN YOU ARE DOWN. A FEW YEARS AGO, SOMEONE DEAR TO ME PASSED AWAY AND THE FIRST
CALL I GOT CAME FROM MY FATHER. WITHOUT HIS SUPPORT AND CARE
FOR ME, I DON'T KNOW HOW I WOULD HAVE MADE IT THROUGH. AS TOO MANY KNOW, IT IS THE SMALL LOVING ACTS THAT HELP RUN
A NORM IS AMOUNT IN TIMES OF GRIEF. MY FATHER IS GOOD WITH ADVICE BUT KEEPS IT SHORT AND THE TAKE AWAY IS USUALLY THE SAME, TO
HELP US FIND OUR OWN WAY. IF YOU DO WHAT YOU LOVE, HOLD NOTHING BACK, AND NEVER LET FEAR OF FAILURE GET IN THE WAY, YOU
HAVE FIGURED OUT THE TRUMP FORMULA.
[APPLAUSE] MY DAD IS A NATURAL BORN
ENCOURAGER. THE LAST PERSON THAT WILL EVER TELL YOU TO GIVE UP YOUR DREAMS. I ALWAYS LOOK FORWARD TO
INTRODUCING HIM TO MY FRIENDS,
ESPECIALLY THE ONES WITH
PRECONCEIVED NOTIONS BECAUSE
THEY MEET A MAN WITH NATURAL
CHARM AND NO FACADE. IN PERSON, MY FATHER IS SO FRIENDLY, CONSIDERATE, FUNNY, REAL. MY FRIENDS WALK AWAY WITH A
GLIMPSE OF ALL HE IS, THE
STRONG, PROTECTIVE, KIND, ENDEARING MAN I'M SO PROUD TO
CALL MY FATHER.
[APPLAUSE] I NEVER PICTURED MYSELF SAYING
ALL OF THIS TO A PACKED ARENA
BUT I'M GRATEFUL FOR THE CHANCE. I HAVE ADMIRED MY FATHER ALL MY LIFE AND LOVED HIM WITH ALL MY
HEART. GOD BLESS AND THANK YOU.
