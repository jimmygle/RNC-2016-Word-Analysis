<strong>Kimberlin Brown</strong>
<p class='short_transcript'> >> GOOD EVENING.
MANY OF YOU KNOW ME FROM ONE OF YOUR FAVORITE SOAP OPERAS, "THE YOUNG AND THE RESTLESS,"  "THE
BOLD AND THE BEAUTIFUL," AND
MANY OTHER<span class='hidden-full-transcript-text'> TELEVISION SHOWS.
SINCE WE ONLY HAVE ONE LIFE TO
LIVE, I DECIDED TO FOLLOW OTHER
DREAMS. I AM NOW AND AVOCADO ROTOR, FOR
ALL OF YOU WALK A MULTI-LOVERS.
. YES, CALIFORNIA AVOCADOS. I ALSO RAN AND OPERATE MY OWN DESIGN BUSINESS WITH MY HUSBAND,
GARY. WE JUST CELEBRATED OUR 21ST
WEDDING ANNIVERSARY. MS. BROWN: GARY AND I ARE PARTNERS RUNNING A SPORTFISHING BUSINESS, RETURN OPERATION, RENT
OPERATIONS AND ASSORTED OTHER
ENTERPRISES. LIKE MANY WOMEN ACROSS OUR
NATION, I HAVE MANY
RESPONSIBILITIES. BECAUSE WE WOMEN HAVE MANY ROLES
IN OUR LIVES, WHEN THE MEDIA AND
THE DEMOCRATS TYPECAST US AS
SINGLE ISSUE VOTERS. WE TAKE CARE OF OUR FAMILIES, WORK, INSIDE AND OUTSIDE THE HOME, PAY THE BILLS, WE MANAGE
THE HOME, TAKE CARE OF OUR
PARENTS, ALL FOCUS ON ONE THING, SECURING THE FUTURE FOR OUR
FAMILIES.
[CHEERING] MS. BROWN: LIKE SO MANY PARENTS TODAY, YOU KNOW, I HAVE GREAT
CONCERNS ABOUT THE DIRECTION OF
OUR COUNTRY AND WHAT IT MEANS
FOR THE FUTURE OF MY CHILDREN. I CANNOT LET THIS ELECTION PASS
BY WITHOUT DOING MY PART AND HELPING GET US BACK ON THE RIGHT TRACK. THAT IS WHY I AM SO GRATEFUL AND HONORED TO BE HERE WITH YOU ALL TONIGHT. YOU KNOW, WHEN A LOOK BACK AT MY GRANDPARENTS, MY MOM AND MY DAD,
I REALIZE THAT SO MUCH OF THEIR LIVES WERE DEVOTED TO ONE GOAL, HOPING ME, MY SISTER TAMMY, MY
BROTHER CHRIS, HAVE EVERY OPPORTUNITY TO SUCCEED. I WAS ALWAYS FULL BY MY
GRANDMOTHER THAT I PUT MY MIND TO, AND I DID.
I WORKED VERY HARD.
[CHEERING] MS. BROWN: WE STARTED BUSINESSES
THAT HAVE SUCCEEDED AND STILL DO
.
WE HAVE ADVENTURES THAT HAVE
NOT. WE HAVE CREATED JOBS AND EVEN MORE TAX DOLLARS.
WE HAVE WORKED 80 HOUR WEEKS,
AND HAVE GONE WITHOUT PAYCHECKS
TO KEEP OUR EMPLOYEES PAID. YOU KNOW, THIS IS NOT UNIQUE TO GARY AND ME.
IT IS THE STORY OF EVERY SMALL
BUSINESS OWNER IN AMERICA.
[APPLAUSE]
[CHEERING] MS. BROWN: I AM A MEMBER OF
CALIFORNIA'S BUSINESSWOMEN FOR
TRUMP. AND WE ARE COMPRISED OF FARMERS, DOCTORS, SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS, ATTORNEYS, AND WOMEN IN JUST ABOUT EVERY FIELD, PROFESSION,
RACE, AND ETHNICITY. WOMEN FOR TRUMP.
WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT OUT-OF-CONTROL, UNREASONABLE GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS THAT NEEDLESSLY ADD COSTS TO DOING
BUSINESS AND TIE US ALL UP IN
RED TAPE.
DON'T GET ME STARTED ABOUT THE
BEWILDERING TAX CODE AND HIGH
TAXES TO BOOT. YOU KNOW, THIS IS NOT TRUE JUST
FOR SMALL BUSINESSES. IT'S FOR FARMING AS WELL. THIS PAST WEEK, OUR BUSINESS IS
CONFRONTING A PROBLEM CAUSED BY
OBAMACARE.
THAT'S A SHOCK, ISN'T IT? AS A SMALL BUSINESS, WE USED TO
OFFER MEDICAL INSURANCE TO OUR
EMPLOYEES. AND FOR THOSE WHO CHOSE TO BE COVERED, WE PAID MOST OF THEIR
PREMIUMS. AND THIS QUARTER, WE HAD SEVERAL EMPLOYEES WHO WORKED OVER THE 30 HOUR THRESHOLD SET BY OBAMACARE
AND BY THE REQUIREMENTS OF LAW,
THEY MUST NOW SENATOR WHEN THE APPROVED HEALTH CARE PLANS.
OUR YOUNGER EMPLOYEES, THEY DO
NOT UNDERSTAND WHY THEY ARE
GETTING FORCED OFF OF THEIR PREVIOUS PLAN, WHICH WAS
SIGNIFICANTLY MORE AFFORDABLE
AND TAILORED TO THEIR NEEDS.
MOST OF OUR EMPLOYEES ARE COLLEGE-AGE, AND VERY HEALTHY. YET, THEY ARE REQUIRED TO BUY
COVERAGE THAT IS NOT MEET THEIR NEEDS AND IS TOO EXPENSIVE FOR
THEIR WALLETS. ONE GOOD THING, IT HAS BEEN A WAKE-UP CALL TO ALL OF OUR YOUNG
EMPLOYEES. THEY ARE ALL VOTING REPUBLICAN
THIS YEAR.
[CHEERING] MS. BROWN: YOU KNOW, ONE THIRD OF SMALL BUSINESSES ARE OWNED BY WOMEN.
[APPLAUSE] MS. BROWN: AND TO THE 9.4 MILLION WOMEN BUSINESS OWNERS
WHO EMPLOY ABOUT 8 MILLION WORKERS, A VALUE OF ABOUT $1.5 TRILLION TO OUR ECONOMY, I URGE
YOU TO THINK ABOUT HOW IMPORTANT
THIS ELECTION IS FOR YOUR FUTURE.
[APPLAUSE] MS. BROWN: WHO DO YOU THINK BETTER UNDERSTAND YOUR CHALLENGES AND WILL STAND WITH YOU, FIGHTING FOR A BETTER
ECONOMY AND MORE OPPORTUNITY?
[APPLAUSE] MS. BROWN: A CAREER WASHINGTON INSIDER WHO ONLY KNOWS HOW TO USE YOUR TAX DOLLARS FOR MORE GOVERNMENT JOBS, AND INCIDENTALLY, LADIES, IN BOTH THEN SENATOR CLINTON'S OFFICE AND THE CLINTON FOUNDATION, MEN HAVE BEEN PAID BETTER THAN
WOMEN.
[BOOING] MS. BROWN: OR A SUCCESSFUL
BUSINESSMAN WHO KNOWS HOW TO
MAKE A PAYROLL, WHO UNDERSTANDS
THE SPECIAL CHALLENGES WOMEN
BUSINESS OWNERS FACE, SUCH AS
GAINING ACCESS TO NEEDED
CAPITAL, AND WHO HAS AN ADMIRABLE RECORD OF HIRING AND
PROMOTING WOMEN IN HIS BUSINESSES. FOR A MOMENT, I WOULD LIKE TO
TOUCH ON AN ISSUE THAT DONALD
HAD SPOKEN ABOUT FROM THE BEGINNING OF HIS CAMPAIGN,
TRADE. AS AN ACTRESS AND FARMER, DID
YOU THINK THOSE TWO WOULD BE IN
THE SAME SENTENCE, HUH?
[LAUGHTER] MS. BROWN: AS SEEN FIRSTHAND THE
IMPACT OF HIGH TAXES, OVERREGULATION, AND SUSPECT
TRADE DEALS. I HAVE SEEN TV AND MOVIE
PRODUCTIONS MOVE OUT OF THE COUNTRY.
IF YOU WERE AN A-LISTER LIKE LEONARDO CAPRIO, OR THE OWNER OF
A STUDIO OR PRODUCER, YOU WERE OK.
IF YOU WERE A CAMERAMAN, SOUND TECHS, BOOM OPERATOR, OR DID ANY OF THE MANY JOBS IN PRODUCTION, YOU WERE JUST OUT OF LUCK.
AT THE TIME, IT DID NOT AFFECT
ME. I DID NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT MY
LOOK WE UNION BOYS WERE TALKING ABOUT, AND NOW, I DO. AND I AM SORRY FOR NOT
UNDERSTANDING THE PLIGHT OF THESE MEN AND WOMEN WHO LOST THEIR LIVELIHOODS, AND THEY DID. AND AS AN AVOCADO GROWER, I
THINK THE IMPACT OF OUR TRADE POLICIES. I HAVE SEEN FIRSTHAND OUR
DOMESTIC MARKET FLOODED WITH IMPORTS THAT HARMED LOCAL FARMERS AND EVEN DROVE SOME OUT
OF BUSINESS. MY NEIGHBORS WHO HAVE RAISED THIS PRODUCT FOR YEARS OF BEING FORCED TO CUT DOWN THEIR GROWTH. I BELIEVE THE DECISIONS ABOUT
TRADE POLICIES AND HOW YOU
BALANCE THE MANY ECONOMIC INTERESTS OF OUR NATION TO
OTHERS, BUT THIS MUCH I DO KNOW. DONALD TRUMP RAISED CONCERNS ON
BEHALF OF WORKING PEOPLE BEFORE THE WASHINGTON ELITES DID.
[APPLAUSE] MS. BROWN: HE WILL MAKE TRADE
DEALS THAT BENEFITS WORKING MEN
AND WOMEN AND FAMILIES RIGHT
HERE IN AMERICA.
[APPLAUSE] MS. BROWN: THERE IS GOING TO BE
A TIME, AND I HOPE SOON, FOR A
WOMAN PRESIDENT. WE HAVE SO MANY OUTSTANDING
WOMEN IN CONGRESS AND IN OUR
STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WHO
ARE READY FOR THE JOB NOW. WHEN THE VERY NEAR FUTURE.
BUT LET US BE CLEAR.
THE DEMOCRATS OFFER OF A WOMAN WHO, WHEN SHE HAD A CHANCE TO STAND UP FOR WOMEN, DID NOT DO SO.
[CHEERING] MS. BROWN: INSTEAD, SHE ATTACKED WOMEN, DENIGRATED THEM, CALL THEM LIARS. I PERSONALLY KNOW VICTIMS, AND
THEY FIND HILLARY'S ACTIONS AND
REMARKS REPULSIVE.
[APPLAUSE] MS. BROWN: HER COMMENTS ARE COMMENTS OF CONVENIENCE ONLY. IF WE ARE TO PROSPER AS A NATION
, IF WE ARE TO GROW THE ECONOMY AND CREATE JOBS, WE NEED
A LEADER WHO WILL GO TO
WASHINGTON AND SHAKE THINGS UP.
[APPLAUSE] MS. BROWN: A PRESIDENT WILL BRING COMMONSENSE REGULATIONS
AND A LIMIT EIGHT UNNECESSARY 1
-- ELIMINATE UNNECESSARY ONES.
WHO WILL FIX OUR TAX SYSTEM AND
START US ON THE PATH TO REBUILD
OUR INFO STRUCTURE. WE NEED SOMEONE WHO KNOWS HOW TO
BUILD THINGS. WHO KNOWS HOW TO CREATE JOBS. AND WHO KNOWS HOW TO NEGOTIATE.
[APPLAUSE] MS. BROWN: WHO IS GOING TO
TACKLE PROBLEMS HEAD ON SO THAT
WE CAN HAVE TRUE PROGRESS. SINCE IT WAS ANNOUNCED THAT I WAS SPEAKING TO YOU ALL TONIGHT, I HAVE BEEN ATTACKED IN SOCIAL
MEDIA WITH ALL KINDS OF
OUTRAGEOUS INSULTS. NONE OF WHICH ARE EVEN REMOTELY
TRUE.
[BOOING] MS. BROWN: THE LEFT WANT TO
SILENCE THOSE THEY DISAGREE WITH IN POLITICS, ONCOLOGY CAMPUSES, AND IN BUSINESS.
-- ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES, AND IN BUSINESSES. THIS MUST STOP. I WILL NOT STAND BY IDLY. IT IS TIME WE STOOD UP FOR OURSELVES, FOR DONALD TRUMP, AND
FOR OUR COUNTRY.
[CHEERING] MS. BROWN: DONALD IS THE MOST
QUALIFIED MAN IN AMERICA TO TURN
THINGS AROUND IN WASHINGTON AND
IN OUR NATION. SO, I ASK YOU TO JOIN ME AND
CALIFORNIA'S BUSINESSWOMEN FOR
TRUMP AND SUPPORTING AMERICA'S
BEST OPPORTUNITY TO RETURN TO GREATNESS. DONALD TRUMP, THE NEXT PRESIDENT
OF THE UNITED STATES.
[CHEERING] MS. BROWN: YES. THANK YOU. THANK YOU.
